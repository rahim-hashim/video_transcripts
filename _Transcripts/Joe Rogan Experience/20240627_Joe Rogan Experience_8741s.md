# Joe Rogan Experience #2007 - Adrienne Iapalucci
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3.0s)]
*  I know these chairs are kind of weird, but they're the fucking best chairs that I've [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7.0s)]
*  ever found for sitting for long hours at a time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=12.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=15.0s)]
*  It's called a Capisco and is it Fully? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=16.0s)]
*  What's the name of the company that makes them? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=19.0s)]
*  They're the shit. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=21.0s)]
*  The best ergonomic chairs I've ever had. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=22.0s)]
*  They're the only for podcasting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=24.0s)]
*  If you think you want to be comfortable in a nice one of those cool chairs with the buttons [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=26.0s)]
*  in it, you know, that people would sit and smoke cigars, after a while you're back and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=32.0s)]
*  hurt. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=36.0s)]
*  You have to kind of stay upright. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=37.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=39.0s)]
*  These are the best. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=41.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=42.0s)]
*  The other one was just so tall. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's some of these, it's weird because they're the same company or the same chair, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=45.0s)]
*  but I think different people made them and some of them get really bad. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=50.0s)]
*  This one doesn't get very low. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=53.0s)]
*  It's called Hag, it's the main company I guess. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=54.0s)]
*  Oh, so they've changed like twice. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=57.0s)]
*  And a few people sell it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=59.0s)]
*  Oh, well that's the shit. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=60.0s)]
*  That's how it works. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=61.0s)]
*  No one's paying me to say that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=62.0s)]
*  They're the shit. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=64.0s)]
*  What's up Adrian? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=65.0s)]
*  How you doing? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=66.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=67.0s)]
*  Should I move this closer? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, right there is good. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=69.0s)]
*  You want some coffee? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=70.0s)]
*  I just had some coffee. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=71.0s)]
*  Last night was really fun. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=72.0s)]
*  It was really fun. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=73.0s)]
*  The club's awesome. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=74.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=75.0s)]
*  I'm really excited about this. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=76.0s)]
*  I'm excited about this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=77.0s)]
*  I'm excited about this. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=78.0s)]
*  I'm excited about this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=79.0s)]
*  The club's awesome. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=80.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm really excited that we got to meet and I'm really excited that I got to see you stand [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=82.0s)]
*  up because Ari Shafir has been singing your praises for so long. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=86.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=90.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=91.0s)]
*  He loves you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=92.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=93.0s)]
*  When I first met him I did not like him. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=94.0s)]
*  I was like, this guy's a dick. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=95.0s)]
*  He's a little misunderstood. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=98.0s)]
*  He can be a dick. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=101.0s)]
*  Well yeah, even when you texted me I was like, is this Ari playing a joke because he's always [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=103.0s)]
*  doing stuff like that to me? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=107.0s)]
*  Does he really? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=109.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=110.0s)]
*  Well that's because he loves you. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=111.0s)]
*  No, absolutely, but I'm always skeptical if something's in his orbit. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=112.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=115.0s)]
*  I'm like, hmm. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=116.0s)]
*  He is the guy that dosed Bert Kreischer at his house. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=117.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=121.0s)]
*  Dosed him at his house when he was supposed to be hanging out with his family. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=122.0s)]
*  He gave him molly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=124.0s)]
*  At least he did it at his house in a safe environment, I guess. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=125.0s)]
*  I think Bert had the fucking time of his life. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=128.0s)]
*  He just doesn't want to admit it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=130.0s)]
*  I could see that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=131.0s)]
*  I think ultimately it was like a really bad thing that Ari did that, but I bet he had [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=132.0s)]
*  a good time. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=138.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=139.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I think it's probably not great for their friendship. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=140.0s)]
*  It was terrible for their friendship. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=143.0s)]
*  The wife was furious at him, and rightly so. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=145.0s)]
*  Rightly so. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=148.0s)]
*  Ari does stuff where you're like, hey, that's not cool. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=149.0s)]
*  Do you know what he did to me? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=153.0s)]
*  So he got into my ex-fiance's computer, wrote an email from him to me. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=156.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=164.0s)]
*  Where it was like, I'm still in love with you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=165.0s)]
*  We should get back together. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=167.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=168.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=169.0s)]
*  I had another boyfriend at the time, and I was like, I don't feel like this at all, so [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=170.0s)]
*  I just deleted it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=173.0s)]
*  Then Ari later was like, you check your emails, and I was like, you're a dick. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=175.0s)]
*  Oh my God, what a psycho. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, what if I still cared about this guy like that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=180.0s)]
*  What if you just started sending pussy pictures? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=183.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=186.0s)]
*  I was like, it's on. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=187.0s)]
*  Come over. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=188.0s)]
*  What if it was like, it's on, and you started sending the wildest shit that you have on [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=189.0s)]
*  your hard drive? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=192.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that would be terrible. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=193.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=194.0s)]
*  Then Ari has it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=195.0s)]
*  And he texts it to you later? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=196.0s)]
*  I think that he got in his email and then left. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=197.0s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=201.0s)]
*  I've had my phone open by him, and he'll write, I love Black Cock on Twitter. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=202.0s)]
*  He just does that. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=206.68s)]
*  Could you imagine being your ex-fiance and then seeing a response to you in his email? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=207.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=214.52s)]
*  Then he's reading that and going, what the fuck did I do? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=215.52s)]
*  He thinks, oh my God, was I on drugs? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=219.36s)]
*  Did I black out? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=220.72s)]
*  I don't remember writing this. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=221.72s)]
*  I think at this point, anything that goes crazy, I think is Ari. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  So I think he would also just be like, who is in my office? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=226.64s)]
*  Well, that's the benefit of having someone like Ari. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=230.04s)]
*  You have plausible deniability on tap. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=234.56s)]
*  You're just like ... [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  Fucking Ari. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  It's Ari. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  He's such a psycho. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  It's Ari. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=241.23999999999998s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  Damn it, Ari. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=243.23999999999998s)]
*  He comes across sometimes as a dick because he's probably autistic, but he is a good guy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=249.28s)]
*  He is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=250.28s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=251.28s)]
*  But I don't think he's autistic. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=252.28s)]
*  I think he just had a hard childhood. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=253.52s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think he ... He'll say stuff where you're like, Ari, this is really inappropriate. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  He does. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  He does. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  So that's the only thing where I'm like, he might be on the spectrum. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  You don't think even the tail end, the beginning ... [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  I think he's such a comedian that he has a really hard time interacting with regular [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=269.92s)]
*  people. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=275.76s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=276.76s)]
*  I think he's so used to the fun of chaos. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=277.76s)]
*  Ari shit in a Tupperware container and brought it to Skankfest and then opened it up on stage [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=281.56s)]
*  in a crowded room where people were gagging and throwing up ... It was Legion of Skanks, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=288.64s)]
*  right? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=293.56s)]
*  Wasn't Skankfest? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=294.56s)]
*  Whatever it was. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=295.56s)]
*  With the Legion of Skanks guys. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=297.08s)]
*  Ari shit in a Tupperware and brought it to the stage. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=298.64s)]
*  Sure, but that's still not as bad as some of the stuff he says. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=302.72s)]
*  That's his level of acceptable behavior. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=307.44s)]
*  To him, that was a thing that you should do. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=311.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=313.84000000000003s)]

*  It's just a possibility that someone like that exists. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=495.88s)]
*  Everyone was nice to me. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=499.96s)]

*  It was weird because it was a really good thing. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=521.12s)]
*  It was a really good thing because when I was five years old, my parents were breaking [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=524.0s)]

*  no stability in the world. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=532.96s)]
*  And I started thinking about God and I started really getting into God. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  It's like a five year old. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=539.4s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=540.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was like I was looking for someone. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=541.76s)]
*  But it makes sense. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're looking for someone to look after you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=545.4s)]

*  Sure. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=550.56s)]

*  And then going to that church and going to that Catholic school, I was like, okay, maybe, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=556.0799999999999s)]
*  maybe it's God. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=562.8399999999999s)]
*  This lady is not doing the work of God. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=564.4s)]
*  Like, there's no way God knows about this. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=566.6800000000001s)]
*  There's no way God's cool with this. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=568.44s)]
*  There's no way God's like, she's ultimately, unless it's to be so fucking mean that you [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=570.44s)]
*  make people think for themselves. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=575.44s)]

*  Because then you'd be trapped with this animals have souls two thing and then you can never [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=611.52s)]

*  to now. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=652.8399999999999s)]

*  Probably a lot. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  And the thing is, I like I don't feel bad eating the ugly animals like chickens are not particularly [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=657.0799999999999s)]
*  cute, but like cows are so cute. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=661.64s)]

*  Isn't it interesting that wild pigs aren't cute at all? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=674.72s)]
*  They're not even a little cute. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  They're ferocious looking. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=680.3199999999999s)]

*  Not the babies. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=693.3599999999999s)]

*  What's that like evolution? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=700.56s)]
*  It's not like eagles care if something's cute. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=702.24s)]
*  It's like a thinking animal that discerns cuteness and doesn't want to harm cute things. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=705.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  Like lions don't care about hunting something. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=711.8000000000001s)]
*  But is that for us? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=714.6800000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=733.5600000000001s)]
*  We don't kill it so we can grow up to be able to kill us. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=735.04s)]
*  It's a trick. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=737.4799999999999s)]
*  I think that we just like are reasoning and thinking about it. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=739.1199999999999s)]
*  But like there's people that would probably kill it still. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=742.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=744.4799999999999s)]
*  But it's a trick. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=746.4s)]
*  But it's an interesting one. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=747.56s)]
*  Because it really, I think it only works on us. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't think chimps give a fuck about cuteness. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  No, but they do love their like offspring. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=753.5999999999999s)]
*  Sure, but all animals do. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  All animals do. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=758.1199999999999s)]
*  But it's not because they're cute. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=759.1199999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=760.1199999999999s)]
*  When we see other things, babies, we think they're cute. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=761.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=764.76s)]
*  Like we go, oh my god. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=765.76s)]

*  Hey, little wolf puppies. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=775.4s)]
*  But I also realize that they would kill me. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=776.4s)]
*  They're so different than dogs. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=779.0s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=780.88s)]
*  They're so different than dogs. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=782.08s)]
*  And they look kind of like dogs until you get them around dogs. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=784.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=788.24s)]
*  I mean, they're cute, but they're not as cute as like a husky. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=789.24s)]
*  I was at a dog park once when a guy brought in a wolf. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=793.88s)]
*  Are they legal? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=796.84s)]
*  Yeah, you can have a wolf. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=797.84s)]
*  In a dog park? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=798.84s)]
*  Yeah, you can have like a seven eighth timber wolf as a pet. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=799.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=804.96s)]
*  I had a friend who had a couple of them. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=805.96s)]
*  And one of them even got out and killed a bunch of sheep. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=807.64s)]
*  Like they're wolves, like real wolves. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=810.96s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you should have them as pets. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=813.2s)]
*  So I'm at the dog park and this fucking dude comes in with a wolf. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=815.0s)]
*  It was the wildest thing where every dog was like, what the fuck? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=819.2s)]
*  Do you know what that is? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=825.08s)]
*  Every dog was like, oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=826.5200000000001s)]
*  They all like slunk down and moved away from it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=830.12s)]
*  It was like he was walking through a tide. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=832.6400000000001s)]
*  Like everything pulled back. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=835.84s)]
*  That's like their Jesus. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=838.24s)]
*  In his presence. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=839.24s)]
*  Well, that's their monster. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=840.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=841.24s)]
*  Wolves eat dogs. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=842.24s)]
*  Was your dog there? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=843.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=844.24s)]
*  Did you take your dog out? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=845.24s)]
*  Oh, I got the fuck right the fuck out of there. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=846.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=847.8000000000001s)]
*  I live in the Bronx and there's always like people have pit bulls and you know dogs. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=849.4s)]
*  Some of them are really nice and some of them they just walk off the leash. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=852.92s)]
*  So this one day I had a boxer and this pit bull got loose. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  I was with my ex-boyfriend at the time. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  He jumped on a car and I just picked my dog up. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=861.3399999999999s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=864.12s)]
*  I was just getting ready to get. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=865.12s)]
*  He jumped on the car to get away from the dog? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=866.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=868.64s)]
*  And left your puppy? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=869.64s)]
*  Yes, but I think that's also maybe culturally. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=870.64s)]
*  He was black and I think that's a whole thing where he's just not raised the same with dogs [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=873.24s)]
*  and stuff. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=877.12s)]
*  He jumped on the car and I just held my dog. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=878.44s)]
*  I was like I'm ready to get attacked. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=879.72s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=881.52s)]
*  The dog did nothing but then he showed me how I, because I was like I'm scared to walk [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=882.6s)]
*  my dog now. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=886.52s)]
*  So he showed me how I could like kill a dog and I would walk around with a knife. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=887.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=891.4s)]

*  pit bulls, at least two of which were unleashed. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=948.36s)]
*  Fuck that guy. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=952.84s)]
*  I hate seeing dogs off the leash. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=953.84s)]
*  One of his dogs tried to bite my little dog and he tried to tell me that's that it's okay [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=955.64s)]
*  and I tried to talk sense into him. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=961.28s)]
*  Brian told News 4 he and the man started to argue as his dogs attacked Ellie. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=963.28s)]
*  I kicked one of the dogs off my dog at one point, Brian said, but then he took out a [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=969.4s)]
*  knife and started carving and my dog growled. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=973.54s)]
*  He stuck him and I was helpless at that time. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=977.12s)]
*  Brian said he took a photo of the man as he walked away below. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=980.64s)]
*  The couple then took their dog to the veterinarian where Ellie had to be put down. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=982.92s)]
*  Wow, so that guy with those dogs just stabbed someone's dog because his dog bit the dog. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=988.4s)]
*  That guy would be fucking dead. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=996.6s)]
*  That's why I can't have a gun because there's so many people I would kill. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=999.76s)]
*  I don't know if those are pit bulls. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1002.8s)]
*  They look like a... [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1005.2s)]
*  They look like French bulldogs. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1006.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1007.2s)]
*  No, I think they're American bulldogs. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1008.2s)]
*  My mom has a gun. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1010.04s)]
*  No, American bulldogs are actually larger than pit bulls. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1011.04s)]
*  American bulldogs are big. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1013.96s)]
*  Those dogs are like this though. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1014.96s)]
*  Those look more like... [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1016.1600000000001s)]
*  They do make these little bullies. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1018.2800000000001s)]
*  You ever seen those bullies? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what my mom's dog is. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1020.5600000000001s)]
*  Like miniature bullies? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1021.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1022.5600000000001s)]
*  It's like low to the ground but like that. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1023.5600000000001s)]
*  It's jacked. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1024.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1025.56s)]
*  I think those aren't like... [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1026.56s)]
*  The really scary pit bulls, believe it or not, are not the ones that look like the scary [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1027.56s)]
*  pit bulls. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1032.88s)]
*  I mean those are scary too, but the really scary ones are the smaller ones because those [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1033.88s)]
*  are the ones they really raised for dog fighting. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1036.8400000000001s)]
*  Brian Cowling got one of those ones. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1039.72s)]
*  He had one as a pet. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1041.8400000000001s)]
*  It was a real problem and it looked like a regular dog. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1042.8400000000001s)]
*  It looked like a regular dog. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1045.76s)]
*  They don't have big giant heads and it only weighed like 35 pounds. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1046.76s)]
*  Pocket bullies. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1049.36s)]
*  That little fucker. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1050.36s)]
*  That's what my mom has. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1051.36s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1052.36s)]
*  Those little things, they're weird fucking breeding choices that people have made to [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1053.36s)]
*  make these little tiny pit bulls, but I don't think those are aggressive. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1059.36s)]
*  My mom's dog's not aggressive, but she's like scared of everything because another dog [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1062.36s)]
*  got loose and attacked her, so she's like scared now of everything. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1067.9599999999998s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1070.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's got to be traumatic to dogs. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1071.36s)]
*  But like if that would drive me nuts if I was that guy, I would do terrible things [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1072.36s)]
*  to his dogs. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1077.36s)]
*  It's just to him. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1078.36s)]
*  Fuck, the dogs are just being dogs. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1079.36s)]
*  I know, but like put him on a leash. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1081.36s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1083.36s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not like, yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1084.36s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1085.36s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1086.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, if you could kill him then do it. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1087.36s)]
*  That's the thing about taking dogs in public, like you never know. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1090.36s)]
*  Like there's this guy that I used to run these trails with and I think he worked for this [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1094.36s)]
*  lady because I don't think he really had good control of the dogs. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1099.36s)]
*  And oddly enough, one of the dogs was a golden lab and he was really aggressive. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1102.36s)]
*  And he went after my dog and bit my dog. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1108.36s)]
*  And I had to like kick the dog off him and it was like, it was awful. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1110.36s)]
*  But I'm like a golden lab just snapped at the dog. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1114.36s)]
*  And the guy couldn't control him. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1117.36s)]
*  I thought you were talking about this video. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1119.36s)]
*  Oh, this was horrible. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1121.36s)]
*  Yeah, that was horrible. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1123.36s)]
*  Yeah, the guy didn't have control of his dogs and they were attacking this woman. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1125.36s)]
*  That's why your dogs need to be on a leash. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1129.36s)]
*  I mean, that's just crazy. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1131.36s)]
*  You're not in the mountains. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1132.36s)]
*  There's a guy that used to have three German shepherds who walked them all off the leash in the Bronx. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1133.36s)]
*  Right, but why is that dog attacking people? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1136.36s)]
*  Why is that dog just attacking a lady for no reason? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1138.36s)]
*  Like what is going on with those dogs? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1140.36s)]
*  Maybe they're trained. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1142.36s)]
*  Yeah, what is going on? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1143.36s)]
*  Or if you rescue them and you don't know where they're from. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1144.36s)]
*  God damn it, that's scary. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1146.36s)]
*  That's very scary. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1148.36s)]
*  That's terrifying shit. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1149.36s)]
*  Such a fucked up way to go. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1151.36s)]
*  Also, that's so weird that that guy came into the park with a wolf. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1153.36s)]
*  It's like, what are you doing? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1156.36s)]
*  It was a long time ago. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1157.36s)]
*  You know, it was real weird. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1159.36s)]
*  But people have those things. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1164.36s)]
*  They have those wolf breeds, wolf dogs. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1166.36s)]
*  There's one guy I knew had three of them. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1170.36s)]
*  And you would go over to his house, if you made noise, like, oh, they would go, oh. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1173.36s)]
*  They would all just howl in. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1178.36s)]
*  They're not dogs. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1180.36s)]
*  It's so interesting. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1181.36s)]
*  They like, there's no like telling them what to do. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1182.36s)]
*  Sit, lay down, fuck you. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1185.36s)]
*  Those dogs should be out in the wild. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1187.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1189.36s)]
*  And this guy had them in a yard. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1190.36s)]
*  It's like, it's kind of crazy. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1191.36s)]
*  That's not where they should be. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1193.36s)]
*  These dogs are wild. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1194.36s)]
*  They should be out in, you know. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1195.36s)]
*  It's also kind of crazy to fix them. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1196.36s)]
*  You just cutting off their testosterone supplies. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1198.36s)]
*  I bet they're still pretty aggressive. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1202.36s)]
*  They're not the same. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1205.36s)]
*  They're definitely not the same. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1206.36s)]
*  I mean, I get it that you don't want them to have puppies, but you should just be in control of your dog. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1208.36s)]
*  It's such a weird animal, wolves. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1212.36s)]
*  You know, because we killed them off. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1217.36s)]
*  And now we're like, let's bring them back. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1219.36s)]
*  And have them in the park with other dogs that have no fighting chance against it, if it goes nuts. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1221.36s)]
*  Well, that case, that guy, you know, had it supposedly as a pet. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1226.36s)]
*  I just think people get pet sometimes. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1230.36s)]
*  It's like, you don't have to really know what you're doing to get, like, a German dog. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1232.36s)]
*  Like a German Shepherd. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1237.36s)]
*  You can get a police dog, German Shepherd, like a really aggressive, very smart thinking, like almost like a predator of people. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1238.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1247.36s)]
*  And you could just get it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1248.36s)]
*  Anybody can get it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1249.36s)]
*  I mean, somebody I think in Manhattan had like an alligator. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1250.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1254.36s)]
*  Like you get these like little animals where they're cute and then it like gets to be humongous. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1255.36s)]
*  And you're like, this is a real problem. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1258.36s)]
*  I think a dude in the Bronx had a tiger. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1259.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1261.36s)]
*  I see that happening. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1262.36s)]
*  His fucking house. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1263.36s)]
*  This guy had a tiger at his house. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1264.36s)]
*  Yeah, people are nuts. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1266.36s)]
*  Imagine like telling a girl at a club you have a baby tiger. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1268.36s)]
*  Like even if you don't want to fuck this guy, like I do want to see this baby tiger. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1271.36s)]
*  Where was this? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1275.36s)]
*  This is his alligator found in New York City Lake. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1277.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1280.36s)]
*  Brooklyn. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1281.36s)]
*  So what do you think happened there? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1282.36s)]
*  Do you think that was like a pet? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1284.36s)]
*  It's probably a pet and it got too big and somebody was like, I don't know what to do with this. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1285.36s)]
*  And he put it in this park in the water. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1288.36s)]
*  That's the story of Florida. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1290.36s)]
*  Florida is an amazing story. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1292.36s)]
*  Florida is just overrun with pythons. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1295.36s)]
*  There's a half a million pythons in the Everglades. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1298.36s)]
*  They say that 99 percent of all of the mammals are gone. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1302.36s)]
*  Of everything. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1306.36s)]
*  Raccoons, deer, everything. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1307.36s)]
*  Rabbits. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1309.36s)]
*  They're all gone. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1310.36s)]
*  Foxes, pumas, everything. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1311.36s)]
*  Maybe that's what you need to be hunting then. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1313.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, they are doing that. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1315.36s)]
*  What's crazy is in California, python skin is illegal. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1316.36s)]
*  So you can't. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1320.36s)]
*  It's banned. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1321.36s)]
*  You can't get python in California. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1322.36s)]
*  Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, they're overrun with pythons. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1325.36s)]
*  Like they literally have wiped out all of the native wildlife. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1329.36s)]
*  They're eating alligators now. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1333.36s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1335.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1336.36s)]
*  Forty-twenty-five-pound cut tiger living in Harlem apartment. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1337.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1341.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1342.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's part of the story. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1343.36s)]
*  I mean, imagine showing up to that and you're like, I'm out of here. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1345.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1348.36s)]
*  I'm not getting paid enough for this. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1349.36s)]
*  I think they're the most beautiful animals. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1351.36s)]
*  They're beautiful. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1353.36s)]
*  But like, what are you doing in a tiny studio apartment with a tiger? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1354.36s)]
*  No, it's insane. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1358.36s)]
*  It's an insane person. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1359.36s)]
*  It's like some dude who met some dude who knows a guy who can get you a tiger. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1360.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1363.36s)]
*  Do you know there's more tigers in Texas in private collections than there are in all of the wild of the world? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1364.36s)]
*  Are they just like in their private backyards and stuff? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1371.36s)]
*  Tiger world. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1375.36s)]
*  I mean, when they attack people, I'm like, yeah, I get it. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1376.36s)]
*  You're caging this animal that should be in the wild. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1379.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1382.36s)]
*  Texas is very strange when it comes to wildlife. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1383.36s)]
*  You can kind of own anything. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1385.36s)]
*  Texas, this is like a... [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1387.36s)]
*  Get you a zebra. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1389.36s)]
*  Just fucking nuts here. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1390.36s)]
*  Anything goes. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1391.36s)]
*  Get you a zebra, Adrienne. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1392.36s)]
*  I want a baby zebra. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1393.36s)]
*  I don't want it to get big. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1394.36s)]
*  Once it gets big, I'm going to put it in that lake with that alligator. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1395.36s)]
*  Like, here, fend for yourself. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1398.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's apparently like a couple thousand more tigers in Texas than there are in the wild. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1402.36s)]
*  Did you ever watch Tiger King? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1407.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1409.36s)]
*  I mean, just like such trash. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1410.36s)]
*  It's so great. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1412.36s)]
*  I was not so secretly hoping that Trump would pardon him. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1413.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1416.36s)]
*  Do you like this guy has like probably a third level education. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1417.36s)]
*  He's just trying to make money. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1421.36s)]
*  Talk to those straight guys into fucking him. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1422.36s)]
*  So respect. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1424.36s)]
*  Yeah, but I feel like rich people can get away with that. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1425.36s)]
*  It's like why women, hot women fuck ugly dudes that are rich. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1429.36s)]
*  You're like, well, hopefully you'll buy me something. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1432.36s)]
*  You think that works with guys? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1433.36s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1434.36s)]
*  I guess with some guys. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1436.36s)]
*  But everything. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1438.36s)]
*  It's like what works on everybody, you know? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1439.36s)]
*  Because like some things don't work on some people, they work on other people. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1441.36s)]
*  I think money always works on everyone. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1446.36s)]
*  Sure, but like some people are really dumb. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1449.36s)]
*  Like some people, you can get them with a pretty simple cult. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1452.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1455.36s)]
*  Not even that good, you know? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1456.36s)]
*  If you just post on Craigslist that you're starting a new religion. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1458.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1460.36s)]
*  I've thought about doing it and seeing who would show up. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1461.36s)]
*  People would show up. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1463.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1464.36s)]
*  Loyalists. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1465.36s)]
*  They would be, I was the first. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1466.36s)]
*  I was with Adrienne when she became awoken. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1467.36s)]
*  In the beginning. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1469.36s)]
*  That'd be so crazy. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1471.36s)]
*  You could start a cult. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1473.36s)]
*  100% you could start a cult. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1474.36s)]
*  I would do that and then just start a landscaping business. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1475.36s)]
*  And that would be what I tell them how religion is. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1478.36s)]
*  Just cleaning people's yards and stuff. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1480.36s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1483.36s)]
*  It's such a weird thing, cults. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1485.36s)]
*  Because it seems to be like a natural pattern of behavior that people have. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1487.36s)]
*  Where they're willing to believe fucking total nonsense. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1494.36s)]
*  As long as everybody in the group believes total nonsense. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1497.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1500.36s)]
*  It's also wanting to like belong to something. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1501.36s)]
*  Yep. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1503.36s)]
*  Especially if you feel like an outcast. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1504.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1506.36s)]
*  And there's some that are good at it. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1507.36s)]
*  Like Scientology's good at it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1509.36s)]
*  I think at the root of every cult there is a guy that wants to fuck everyone. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1511.36s)]
*  Generally. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1515.36s)]
*  Generally. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1516.36s)]
*  Most of those cults start out where like you have to fuck me and that's how you get to this higher level. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1517.36s)]
*  Or the Heaven's Gate guy. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1522.36s)]
*  You have to cut your balls off. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1524.36s)]
*  Remember that guy? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1526.36s)]
*  I do but I don't remember cutting your balls off. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1527.36s)]
*  Everybody had to castrate themselves. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1529.36s)]
*  Was he castrated also? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1530.36s)]
*  I think he was. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1531.36s)]
*  He might have done it to himself. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1533.36s)]
*  And got people to do it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1535.36s)]
*  It was a weird one. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1536.36s)]
*  They all wore the same Nikes. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1539.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1540.36s)]
*  And they all killed themselves because they thought that the spaceship was coming to take them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1541.36s)]
*  They had to kill themselves. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1544.36s)]
*  What's crazy is I watched that documentary and I was bored by it. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1545.36s)]
*  Well it's weird right? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1548.36s)]
*  Because it's like it's so dumb. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1551.36s)]
*  You're like who's buying into this? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1553.36s)]
*  But even something that dumb. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1555.36s)]
*  There's someone out there that's like fucking Nikes. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1558.36s)]
*  It's a weird one. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1561.36s)]
*  Click on that. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1563.36s)]
*  How it really happened. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1564.36s)]
*  It's such a strange story. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1566.36s)]
*  Because I don't know what the guy's origin was. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1568.36s)]
*  Like how he got all these people. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1571.36s)]
*  It's not planned. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1577.36s)]
*  I just remember watching it and being very bored by it. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1579.36s)]
*  I was bored by this guy that started a cult and got everyone to kill themselves. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1582.36s)]
*  I loved Wild Wild Country. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1586.36s)]
*  Did you see that one? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1587.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1588.36s)]
*  Is that the one where they're going through a drive through? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1589.36s)]
*  That's the one where the Indian guru. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1591.36s)]
*  He set up shop in this town in Oregon. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1594.36s)]
*  They took over the whole town. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1597.36s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1599.36s)]
*  Yeah and they started busing in homeless people so they could vote out everybody. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1600.36s)]
*  So the homeless people would now be citizens. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1603.36s)]
*  That's a good angle. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1605.36s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1606.36s)]
*  But then it was really sad. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1607.36s)]
*  Because those homeless people had a sense of purpose for the first time in their life. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1608.36s)]
*  And some of them were like I'm fucking all in. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1611.36s)]
*  These are my people. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1613.36s)]
*  And they were fucking doing hard work. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1615.36s)]
*  And they were really like they felt. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1617.36s)]
*  And then at the end after they voted they get the fuck out of here. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1619.36s)]
*  UFO cults. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1622.36s)]

*  That's someone else putting something. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1645.36s)]
*  But this is part of some history channel thing I think. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1647.36s)]
*  Did you hear about the Sanctum Cult stuff today with Hunter Biden? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1650.36s)]

*  I'm obsessed with Hunter Biden. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1655.36s)]
*  Yeah the story I saw was that the leader of this LA sex club that cost $75,000 a year was kicked out of the club because he shared that Hunter Biden was once a member. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1656.36s)]
*  And all he shared was like a social media post that said I kicked him out because he was weird. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1666.36s)]
*  But then they kicked him out of the club because like you're not allowed to talk about the club. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1671.36s)]

*  And he's like there's no difference. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1705.36s)]
*  It's pharmacologically it's the same drug. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1707.36s)]

*  Oh absolutely. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1717.36s)]
*  They're like if you get busted with cocaine it's one thing. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1718.36s)]

*  No. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1736.36s)]
*  Rick Ross not the rapper but the real Rick Ross was a drug dealer in South Central L.A. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1737.36s)]
*  OK. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1743.36s)]
*  And he couldn't even read and he was making millions and millions of dollars. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1744.36s)]

*  So they lock him up. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1769.36s)]
*  He learns how to read in jail and becomes a lawyer and then realizes they got him on they got him on three strikes. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1771.36s)]
*  But it can't be three strikes in one crime. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1780.36s)]
*  It has to be three different crimes three different arrests. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1784.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1788.36s)]

*  It's not like our government approves that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1819.36s)]
*  Didn't Reagan like put crack into the community pretty much. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1821.36s)]

*  Very difficult physiologically. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1904.36s)]

*  Oh yeah he was taking it all day. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1943.36s)]
*  That was rough for him. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1946.36s)]
*  That's why he started doing crack. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1947.36s)]
*  I had a buddy that was a comic and it was like just having anxiety attacks. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1949.36s)]
*  He just couldn't fucking control it and start taking Xanax. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1953.36s)]
*  And it all went away. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1956.36s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it was fun again. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1958.36s)]
*  It was weird. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1960.36s)]

*  And I know it was his health deteriorated after. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1965.36s)]
*  But he was drinking while he was doing it which you're not supposed to do. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1968.36s)]
*  Which a lot of people do do. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1971.36s)]

*  She had a glass of wine. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1975.36s)]
*  She goes a glass of wine and a Xanax and I don't give a fuck about the world. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1977.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1983.36s)]
*  I've taken Xanax. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1984.36s)]
*  If I went to Australia and I took it and I slept most of the flight. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1985.36s)]
*  It just knocks you out. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1988.36s)]
*  Yeah I would imagine. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1990.36s)]
*  It's a good move for a 16 hour flight. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1991.36s)]
*  But is the come down bad? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1993.36s)]
*  You're exhausted. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1995.36s)]
*  You're like so tired the rest of that day. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1996.36s)]
*  You're like dead. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1998.36s)]
*  You're done. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=1999.36s)]
*  There's nothing you could do. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2000.36s)]
*  That's why I would only take it if I was flying. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2001.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2004.36s)]
*  Yeah that would make me think that if you took it before you went on stage. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2005.36s)]
*  That wouldn't be good either. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2009.36s)]
*  No it's like a real downer. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2010.36s)]
*  I think he was doing that though. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2013.36s)]
*  I'm amazed by people that could do so much drugs and drink and go on stage. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2015.36s)]
*  I wonder though like how it's interacting with whatever individual's level of anxiety. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2019.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2025.36s)]
*  We all assume that people have the same anxiety. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2026.36s)]
*  But my level of anxiety differs throughout the day. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2028.36s)]
*  And depending on what I'm doing. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2031.36s)]
*  Depending on my activity level. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2033.36s)]
*  Whether I've exercised. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2035.36s)]
*  Whether I slept well. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2036.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2037.36s)]
*  So I don't have a lot of anxiety. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2038.36s)]
*  But if someone had a lot of anxiety. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2041.36s)]
*  I don't even know what that feels like. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2044.36s)]
*  Like if Xanax is the only thing that takes them out of that. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2048.36s)]
*  Like give them some fucking Xanax. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2051.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2053.36s)]
*  It's just for me it makes me like a zombie. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2054.36s)]
*  That's why I really can't take it. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2056.36s)]
*  I just wish there was something that had that sort of an effect. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2058.36s)]
*  But wasn't like so ferociously addictive. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2061.36s)]
*  I mean. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2065.36s)]
*  Probably mushrooms. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2066.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2068.36s)]
*  I'm scared to do any of those drugs. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2070.36s)]
*  I bet that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2072.36s)]
*  Micro dosing. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2073.36s)]
*  Scared. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2074.36s)]
*  Why? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2075.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2076.36s)]
*  I did an edible when I was at Moon Tower like last year. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2077.36s)]
*  And I never done it before. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2081.36s)]
*  And it was like the worst experience. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2083.36s)]
*  How many milligrams? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2085.36s)]
*  I don't remember. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2087.36s)]
*  It was like in a bag that they gave you. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2088.36s)]
*  My friend was like this is. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2090.36s)]
*  She was like no it was like from a company though. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2091.36s)]
*  She was like this is very weak. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2093.36s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2094.36s)]
*  But it wasn't just like some guy off the street handed it to me. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2095.36s)]
*  So I was like oh this seems legitimate. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2097.36s)]
*  And I took it and I remember going to sleep and waking up to hearing the ocean. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2099.36s)]
*  I mean it was so wild. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2103.36s)]
*  I thought I was in that movie with Russell Crowe. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2105.36s)]
*  What's that movie where he's like he thinks he's in the CIA but he's just bipolar or schizophrenic. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2107.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2113.36s)]
*  So the whole time I thought I was like that situation. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2114.36s)]
*  I mean my I go. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2117.36s)]
*  It's not good for me. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2118.36s)]
*  Like my friend came over and I was like I use the same logic he used where he realized those people never aged. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2119.36s)]
*  Where I was like okay well you're you're the same now. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2125.36s)]
*  Like it was so crazy. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2128.36s)]
*  I can't do I can't do drugs. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2129.36s)]
*  Those people never aged? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2131.36s)]
*  In that movie he's like I guess he sees like a little girl and he has this roommate. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2132.36s)]
*  The Russell Crowe movie. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2136.36s)]
*  Oh the Russell Crowe movie. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2137.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2138.36s)]
*  So but he realized they're not real because 10 years later they're still the same age. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2139.36s)]
*  And I use that logic to think that like my friend I was like well you're still exactly the same. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2143.36s)]
*  Like it was just I went there. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2149.36s)]
*  It was so crazy. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2151.36s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2152.36s)]
*  That's why I was like I'm not good on drugs. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2153.36s)]
*  Well that's a big dose it sounds like. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2155.36s)]
*  I think someone the problem with those edibles they still have a bit about is they're not consistent. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2157.36s)]
*  They're not making the same place they make Tylenol. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2161.36s)]
*  They should. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2163.36s)]
*  Yeah they should. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2164.36s)]
*  It should be legal. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2166.36s)]
*  They should all be legal so we'd know exactly what the fuck you're taking. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2167.36s)]
*  I mean how many people have to die of fentanyl before they realize like we have to figure out. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2170.36s)]
*  Like there's a demand for these drugs. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2175.36s)]
*  People want these drugs. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2177.36s)]
*  Maybe it's education. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2178.36s)]
*  Maybe it's counseling. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2179.36s)]
*  Maybe it's drug rehabilitation centers that we need to open everywhere. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2180.36s)]
*  And then there's a business in that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2183.36s)]
*  But you should be allowing people to have access to the actual drug not coke that you're getting on the street that's cut with fentanyl that's going to kill people. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2185.36s)]
*  And how many people have to fucking die before you realize you're not going to stop people from doing coke with a just say no campaign. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2195.36s)]
*  So what are you going to do. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2201.36s)]
*  Why don't you let reputable companies sell that and sell pure versions of it and tell them what the fucking doses is going to kill you. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2202.36s)]
*  Let people know what's going on and then make it so that you have to be 21 to buy it and educate people like we're going to open up the country to legal drug sales because if you don't all you're doing is arming the outlaws. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2211.36s)]
*  You're giving them money all the outlaws regulated. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2224.36s)]
*  And it's right south across our border. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2227.36s)]
*  The Mexican cartels are fucking killing it and they're not killing it because just say no worked. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2229.36s)]
*  They're killing it because we don't have legal drugs. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2235.36s)]
*  They sell illegal drugs. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2238.36s)]
*  It's fucking bananas that a problem so so obvious. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2239.36s)]
*  It's like this. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2243.36s)]
*  It's it's an uncomfortable solution but you've got to rip off the fucking bandaid and you've got to make everything legal. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2244.36s)]
*  Remember that professor that was doing heroin recreationally. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2251.36s)]
*  Dr. Carl Hart. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2255.36s)]
*  I was the same guy. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2256.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2257.36s)]
*  I love that dude. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2258.36s)]
*  He's been on the podcast a few times. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2259.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2261.36s)]
*  Well he does it recreationally. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2262.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2263.36s)]
*  And he talks about it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2264.36s)]
*  He says it's wonderful. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2265.36s)]
*  He says it's wonderful. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2266.36s)]
*  He says I love to just be with my wife and listen to music. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2267.36s)]
*  I just feel like once I did that I'd be like well this also seems like a good idea tomorrow. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2271.36s)]
*  I don't know that I would stop. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2276.36s)]
*  Well that's a problem with addiction. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2278.36s)]
*  Like it's just like that guy can do it but like. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2280.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2283.36s)]
*  Well one of the things that he talked about that's interesting he's like this heroin withdrawal myth. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2285.36s)]
*  He's like it's like getting sick. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2292.36s)]
*  It's like you're sick with a cold for a couple of days. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2294.36s)]
*  He goes that's what it's like. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2296.36s)]
*  It's not like you're dying. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2297.36s)]
*  He goes it's not that bad. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2299.36s)]
*  He goes it's just very exaggerated in media depictions of films and people are like. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2301.36s)]
*  That sounds awful. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2307.36s)]
*  Sounds like it sucks. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2308.36s)]
*  Who wants to like. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2309.36s)]
*  Have a cold for a few days but then you're not addicted to heroin anymore. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2310.36s)]
*  But then if you just keep doing heroin you just keep feeling better. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2313.36s)]
*  Well also you got to realize like sick. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2316.36s)]
*  Like what does sick mean. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2319.36s)]
*  What does sick mean. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2320.36s)]
*  Like if you're sick and you've been doing heroin a lot and so you're malnourished and your immune system is dead. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2321.36s)]
*  And you know you're you're very little sleep and you're just all fucked up and poor. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2327.36s)]
*  And then you get withdrawals and you get really sick. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2333.36s)]
*  That could fucking kill you. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2337.36s)]
*  Depending upon your health. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2339.36s)]
*  Depending on how healthy of a heroin person you are. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2340.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2343.36s)]
*  Like I wonder if he calls in sick and everyone's like he's doing heroin. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2344.36s)]
*  People do heroin recreationally and they have for a long time. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2346.36s)]
*  There was this buddy of mine who was a longshoreman in Boston and he worked with this guy who would buy a bag of heroin at lunch every day. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2350.36s)]
*  And he would go in his truck and he would shoot up. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2358.36s)]
*  That seems like a lot of heroin. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2361.36s)]
*  Well I mean I don't know how much you know he did at a time. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2363.36s)]
*  But he this guy was functional. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2366.36s)]
*  He said he would go in his car. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2368.36s)]
*  He would shoot up. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2370.36s)]
*  Everybody knew what he was doing. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2371.36s)]
*  He would go in his car and shoot up and he would sit in his car for his hour lunch break. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2372.36s)]
*  And then go back to work. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2375.36s)]
*  No problems. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2377.36s)]
*  Insane. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2378.36s)]
*  Insane. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2379.36s)]
*  I mean with Xanax I want to fall asleep. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2380.36s)]
*  It's a weird thing. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2382.36s)]
*  I met a guy who was a pool player once. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2384.36s)]
*  He was like a very prominent like top level pool player. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2386.36s)]
*  Where he would gamble for a lot of money. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2392.36s)]
*  And we were at a pool hall in White Plains New York. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2394.36s)]
*  This guy they called him Buffalo Bill was one of his nicknames. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2396.36s)]
*  Water Dog was another one of his nicknames. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2399.36s)]
*  And this dude he had to do heroin before he played. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2401.36s)]
*  And everybody knew. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2404.36s)]
*  So this guy was gambling with him. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2405.36s)]
*  And this guy Water Dog goes into the bathroom. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2407.36s)]
*  Locks the door. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2410.36s)]
*  He's in there for like 10 minutes. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2411.36s)]
*  He comes out and he just sits on the chair like this. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2413.36s)]
*  Like a billiard chair. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2416.36s)]
*  He sits like this. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2417.36s)]
*  For like 20 minutes. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2418.36s)]
*  Just sits there like this. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2420.36s)]
*  And we were just looking at him. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2424.36s)]
*  And I was you know 23 at the time or something like that. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2426.36s)]
*  I was like look at this motherfucker. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2429.36s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2431.36s)]
*  And then he would get up. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2432.36s)]
*  And it was like he had shark eyes. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2433.36s)]
*  There was like no one there. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2435.36s)]
*  There was no one there. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2437.36s)]
*  And then he would play pool and he couldn't miss. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2438.36s)]
*  He couldn't miss. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2440.36s)]
*  It was insane. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2441.36s)]
*  It was insane to watch. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2442.36s)]
*  They were playing on these pockets. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2443.36s)]
*  This table with these really tight pockets. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2445.36s)]
*  And they're gambling for a lot of money. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2447.36s)]
*  That should be not legal. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2449.36s)]
*  He has no nerves. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2450.36s)]
*  He has no nerves. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2451.36s)]
*  He's not feeling any pressure at all. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2452.36s)]
*  He's just playing perfect. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2454.36s)]
*  And everybody watches like holy shit. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2455.36s)]
*  And it made people want to do heroin. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2458.36s)]
*  Not that it shouldn't have been legal. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2460.36s)]
*  But I'm saying like if you're playing him and you're like against him. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2462.36s)]
*  I'd be like he can't do heroin. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2466.36s)]
*  That just enhances his performance. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2467.36s)]
*  You're talking about pool. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2469.36s)]
*  In the pool world everybody does drugs. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2470.36s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2474.36s)]
*  I mean there's elite players that are completely clean and sober on a professional level. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2475.36s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2480.36s)]
*  But in like pool hall gambling drugs are ubiquitous. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2481.36s)]
*  Drugs were like. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2485.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2486.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2487.36s)]
*  I don't know about the. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2488.36s)]
*  Amphetamines were like the choice pill for people when they gambled like 20 hours in [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2489.36s)]
*  a row. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2494.36s)]
*  They would just take amphetamines and keep gambling. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2495.36s)]
*  I just think like I would be scared to do that. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2497.36s)]
*  Addiction is so rampant in my family. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2500.36s)]
*  Like my biological father was a drug user. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2503.36s)]
*  My uncle was a hells angel. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2506.36s)]
*  He was on tons of drugs and stuff. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2507.36s)]
*  So I just feel like I don't know. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2509.36s)]
*  I have enough issues. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2511.36s)]
*  Yeah I hear you. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2512.36s)]
*  I don't know if drug addiction is. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2513.36s)]
*  I think some of it's got to be physical. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2515.36s)]
*  Some of it's got to be genetic. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2517.36s)]
*  It's got to be. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2518.36s)]
*  It just makes sense. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2519.36s)]
*  People from some parts of the world where they don't have a history of alcohol. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2521.36s)]
*  They experience alcohol. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2525.36s)]
*  They have real problems with it. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2526.36s)]
*  Part of it's got to be genetic. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2527.36s)]
*  But then part of it's got to be cultural too when you're around all these people. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2529.36s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2532.36s)]
*  It becomes like learn behavior. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2533.36s)]
*  It's you know release at the end of the day. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2535.36s)]
*  Give me a fucking beer. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2538.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2539.36s)]
*  It's just become something that you know gets very ingrained. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2540.36s)]
*  And also the patterns of behavior that come with alcoholism. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2544.36s)]
*  The fucking up and the fucking life falling apart and disastrous choices you make. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2547.36s)]
*  Driving drunk. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2553.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2554.36s)]
*  Just like losing your family. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2555.36s)]
*  Fights. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2556.36s)]
*  Like there's so many yeah. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2557.36s)]
*  Yeah all that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2558.36s)]
*  All that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2559.36s)]
*  Just. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2560.36s)]
*  I mean how many lives have been lost to drugs that you could buy legally. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2561.36s)]
*  Like booze. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2565.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2566.36s)]
*  Booze has fucked up more people. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2567.36s)]
*  But I like it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2568.36s)]
*  Yeah of course. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2569.36s)]
*  I like it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2570.36s)]
*  I like a little drink every now and then. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2571.36s)]
*  I don't think it's like but the idea that we're protecting people by keeping some drugs [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2572.36s)]
*  illegal. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2577.36s)]
*  I just I think what we're doing is we're making a nanny state that we can't get out of. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2578.36s)]
*  And we've gotten ourselves into this box. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2582.36s)]
*  This nanny state box. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2584.36s)]
*  Maybe down the line it will be legal. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2586.36s)]
*  It's going to be because it's illegal now in certain states. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2588.36s)]
*  Like Oregon has essentially decriminalized everything. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2591.36s)]
*  They've decriminalized cocaine, mushrooms, whatever. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2596.36s)]
*  You're not supposed to sell it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2600.36s)]
*  You can't sell it but you can have it. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2602.36s)]
*  Which is wild. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2604.36s)]
*  So where do you get it from? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2605.36s)]
*  Yeah that's a good point. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2606.36s)]
*  You know I don't know if they're specific about that. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2608.36s)]
*  I don't know if there's like legal distribution. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2611.36s)]
*  So I know they have legal marijuana. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2613.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2615.36s)]
*  But that's that's like 18 states now have legal weed. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2616.36s)]
*  Legal weed is pretty pretty well accepted as a good thing. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2619.36s)]
*  And I think even though there's a lot of right wing people that smoke weed and I think that was a big change because I think a lot of left wing people were always associated with marijuana and laziness and then right wing people like fuck that fucking potheads. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2624.36s)]
*  Now a lot of right wing people like maybe your dad's got arthritis and he smokes a little weed before he goes to bed and maybe you have an edible and you really like hanging out with your wife and watching movies and then you know you're like hey maybe this pot's not that bad. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2638.36s)]
*  I know don't you feel like a lot of people are doing coke like on both sides. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2653.36s)]
*  I think so. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2657.36s)]
*  I mean I know so. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2658.36s)]
*  I know a lot of people are doing coke. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2660.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2661.36s)]
*  So it's like I don't know. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2662.36s)]
*  I feel like both sides do everything. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2664.36s)]
*  Yeah but I think psychedelics more like well not anymore. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2666.36s)]
*  I used to say psychedelics more likely to be tried by the left but god damn there's a lot of soldiers that have had great benefit with psychedelics and they've shared those experiences with a lot of other soldiers. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2670.36s)]
*  I've had quite a few talk about it on this podcast but one of the things that MAPS is doing is using MDMA for soldiers with PTSD and that's shown amazing results. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2681.36s)]
*  So I think the right is opening up their eyes to more too. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2691.36s)]
*  It's like it's a quality of life thing that's probably been here forever and if you believe in God he probably put all that stuff here for us. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2695.36s)]
*  It's just managing it correctly. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2702.36s)]
*  You know the ones that can be beneficial like mushrooms like MDMA like all these things they have a positive effect when done correctly with the right person. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2704.36s)]
*  And to deny that is just stupid at this point to make them schedule one drugs in 2023 with chat GPT and everyone's got 5G. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2715.36s)]
*  We know what the fuck is going on. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2724.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2726.36s)]
*  Like stop. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2727.36s)]
*  But even something like gambling that's legal can still ruin your life. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2728.36s)]
*  Yeah it can. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2731.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2871.36s)]
*  And it's not only that when my friend took his out he didn't realize. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2872.36s)]
*  First of all they're so fast. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2877.36s)]

*  When they go like you are not catching them. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2881.36s)]
*  And when he saw a cat he just went after it. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2883.36s)]
*  And so he was off leash in this like empty park. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2887.36s)]
*  He thought he'd be fine. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2890.36s)]
*  And the fucking Greyhound just went for that cat. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2891.36s)]
*  Well he's really free now. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2894.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2896.36s)]
*  It's like he didn't realize like oh they're not cool with animals. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2897.36s)]
*  Like that's the whole thing about racing is they're chasing a rabbit. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2901.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2903.36s)]
*  If they see an animal they fucking sprint towards it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2904.36s)]
*  Yeah you can't deprogram that. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2907.36s)]

*  No I know but they're like teaching other dogs to fight. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2992.36s)]
*  I'm surprised they don't use these guys. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2994.36s)]
*  Well it's not really as much about the strength of your like all those extra big muscles. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=2995.36s)]
*  Those are going to like cause you to get tired quicker. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3001.36s)]
*  And then on top of that it's really the bite of the jaw. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3004.36s)]
*  That's true. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3007.36s)]
*  The strength of the bite and then also the game instinct. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3008.36s)]
*  So some dogs when they get hurt they want to get out of there. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3012.36s)]
*  And pit bulls don't care about that. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3014.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3016.36s)]
*  And that's bred into them. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3017.36s)]
*  So when a dog would cower away they wouldn't allow that dog to breed. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3018.36s)]
*  In a lot of places they kill the dog. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3021.36s)]
*  That was the whole thing. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3023.36s)]
*  Whenever they catch dog fighting, the horrible things like what they do to the dogs who lose. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3025.36s)]
*  They don't let them. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3030.36s)]
*  So sad. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3031.36s)]
*  Because they don't want them to breed. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3032.36s)]
*  Like if a dog quits they just kill that dog. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3033.36s)]
*  I remember when everything was going on with Michael Vick and I didn't know what he looked like. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3035.36s)]
*  And I just seen this guy on the front of the newspaper. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3039.36s)]
*  I go who's this guy? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3041.36s)]
*  He's hot. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3042.36s)]
*  And someone was like that's Michael Vick. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3043.36s)]
*  And I was like oh that hurts so bad. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3044.36s)]
*  Yeah he was involved in that stuff. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3047.36s)]
*  I knew a dude at one point in time he had like 13 dogs in his yard in I think he was in Oklahoma. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3049.36s)]
*  And my friend was like I think he really likes dogs. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3059.36s)]
*  I go no. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3063.36s)]
*  I go he's got 13 pit bulls on chains in his yard. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3064.36s)]
*  I go that guy fights dogs. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3068.36s)]
*  Yeah that's gross. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3069.36s)]
*  I hate that. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3070.36s)]
*  He was a dog fighting gambling guy. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3071.36s)]
*  So he was breeding dogs for dog fights. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3076.36s)]
*  That's still going on right now in this country. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3078.36s)]
*  Underground dog fights. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3080.36s)]
*  I can't see that. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3082.36s)]
*  Nothing makes me more upset than that. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3084.36s)]
*  That's horrible. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3086.36s)]
*  What's really fucked up is the dogs are wagging their tails. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3088.36s)]
*  Well because they think that they're doing good. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3091.36s)]
*  Yeah they enjoy that fight. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3093.36s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3098.36s)]
*  So awful. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3099.36s)]
*  It's just so crazy that that's going on right now. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3100.36s)]
*  So much stuff is going on right now. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3104.36s)]
*  Someone's getting sex trafficked right now. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3105.36s)]
*  Right now. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3107.36s)]
*  Right across the border. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3108.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3110.36s)]
*  Whenever I go to the airport and they have those signs in the bathroom like if you're [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3111.36s)]
*  being sex trafficked I'm like you think they're letting them go in the bathroom. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3114.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3117.36s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3118.36s)]
*  It's just so hard to believe that some people are that evil. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3121.36s)]
*  Money makes people do crazy stuff and I think your circumstances too. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3125.36s)]
*  If you don't have money and you're like this is something I can do it's still shitty. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3129.36s)]
*  But I think some people are like I have no other choice. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3133.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3135.36s)]
*  It doesn't make it right. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3136.36s)]
*  They have no other choice but to sex traffic. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3138.36s)]
*  Can't you sell stuff. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3140.36s)]
*  Yeah they're selling the women. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3142.36s)]
*  I think it's the amount of money too. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3144.36s)]
*  Yes I think if you're selling you know knives door to door you're not making as much. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3147.36s)]
*  It's like I tried doing this for a year I was making a lot of money. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3152.36s)]
*  Knives door to door. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3155.36s)]
*  Imagine having enthusiasm for that job. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3157.36s)]
*  No. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3159.36s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3160.36s)]
*  This is how you have to feed yourself. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3161.36s)]
*  Sell knives. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3163.36s)]
*  I remember when I first started doing stand up I would bark for the stage time which is [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3164.36s)]
*  basically like hey do you want to come to a comedy show and like I was so bad at it [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3167.36s)]
*  because people would just be like no I'm like alright. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3171.36s)]
*  I get it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3175.36s)]
*  I mean I felt so dumb doing it. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3176.36s)]
*  Did you develop strategies on like how to talk to people. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3178.36s)]
*  No. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3180.36s)]
*  No. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3181.36s)]
*  I just hated it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3182.36s)]
*  I like it's weird to just be on the street as a salesman like hey come to this show. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3183.36s)]
*  And I think that's only a New York City thing. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3187.36s)]
*  It might be. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3189.36s)]
*  Have you seen it before. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3190.36s)]
*  Here on 6th Street. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3191.36s)]
*  Oh in Austin. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3193.36s)]
*  For other things too. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3194.36s)]
*  For stand up shows. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3195.36s)]
*  For stand up yes and I've seen it for other shows here too. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3196.36s)]
*  No shit. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3198.36s)]
*  I wonder if they got it from New York. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3199.36s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3202.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3204.36s)]
*  I haven't paid attention. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3205.36s)]
*  I always heard of it primarily as a New York thing. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3206.36s)]
*  I know a lot of New York guys used to do that in the early days. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3209.36s)]
*  Yeah and especially in Manhattan everyone's walking so you can just catch people like [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3212.36s)]
*  that. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3216.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3217.36s)]
*  But I was not good at it at all. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3218.36s)]
*  Manhattan's an interesting place for comedy you know because there's so many clubs. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3220.36s)]
*  So many clubs even so many like good bar shows and like lounges so you can get a lot of stage [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3224.36s)]
*  time. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3229.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3230.36s)]
*  And there's a lot of comics there too. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3231.36s)]
*  There's so many comics and a lot of people kind of sprung up after the pandemic too. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3233.36s)]
*  Like a lot of people that had like social media big social media presence and then they [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3239.36s)]
*  just kind of switched into stand up like if you're just doing funny videos. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3243.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3247.36s)]
*  So I think there's more people like that too doing stand up. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3248.36s)]
*  Well if your job got taken away from you during the pandemic I would imagine that would be [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3252.36s)]
*  a good time to try stand up. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3256.36s)]
*  If you'd always wanted to do it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3258.36s)]
*  Sure. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3259.36s)]
*  And you'd have to pay to do stand up. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3260.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3261.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3262.36s)]
*  And you're doing it for other comics. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3263.36s)]
*  So you're not doing it for like audience use. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3264.36s)]
*  You're doing it for like the [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3265.36s)]
*  I mean I haven't done it in a long time but when I was doing it. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3276.36s)]
*  You're say there's 15 comics on the mic you're doing it for those 15 people. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3278.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3279.36s)]
*  So I think it's like a good time to try stand up. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3280.36s)]
*  It's like a good time to try stand up. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3281.36s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3287.36s)]
*  And you're doing it for other comics. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3288.36s)]
*  So you're not doing it for like audience usually. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3289.36s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3290.36s)]
*  Sometimes but most of the time and people still don't quit. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3291.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3294.36s)]
*  You think you would weed them out. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3295.36s)]
*  What kind of an audience you're talking about like how many people are supposed to be there. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3297.36s)]

*  Maybe some people will come in off the street or like at the bar. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3307.36s)]
*  But yeah you're doing it for comics. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3310.36s)]
*  So you're paying to do comedy to your peers. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3311.36s)]

*  Why am I surprised by that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3317.36s)]
*  What good. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3322.36s)]
*  Sounds a lot like that. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3323.36s)]
*  Why not just go to stand up school dinner classes or whatever you know. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3324.36s)]
*  Well. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3326.36s)]
*  Paying for. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3327.36s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3328.36s)]
*  Stand up school. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3329.36s)]
*  But it's like there's no teacher. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3330.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3331.36s)]
*  But it is stand up school. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3332.36s)]
*  It's just like you're you're on a path. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3333.36s)]
*  Yeah I mean that's I know in other places like my friend had come from Seattle was doing [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3337.36s)]
*  stand up. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3341.36s)]
*  She said like in Seattle there's an actual audience. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3342.36s)]
*  You know there might be 100 people so it's a show. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3344.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3347.36s)]
*  But in New York that's not it's a lot of comics in the audience. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3348.36s)]
*  Comics are like looking at their own notes and not necessarily paying attention. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3353.36s)]
*  Do any of the good clubs have open mics. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3357.36s)]
*  Does the seller have an open mic. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3359.36s)]
*  No I know the stand has an open mic night and maybe New York comedy club. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3361.36s)]
*  I think you kind of have to have an open mic night. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3366.36s)]
*  This the seller doesn't. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3370.36s)]
*  It seems like it would be better if they did. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3373.36s)]
*  I know it wouldn't be better financially. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3375.36s)]
*  You know it's always. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3377.36s)]
*  But if you did it during the day when you're not having shows anyway. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3378.36s)]
*  It's just people need places to go up. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3382.36s)]
*  It's like if your growth process is dependent upon you doing stand up in front of 15 comics. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3385.36s)]
*  Well that's why you know you start barking or I would intern for like 10 hours on a Friday night seating the customers and then like get a five minute spot. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3392.36s)]
*  You did intern. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3400.36s)]
*  Yeah I did wild stuff like that's how I came up doing stand up because I was like the open mics are just like other new comics. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3401.36s)]
*  So you would intern meaning you'd work for free. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3409.36s)]
*  I'd work for free. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3411.36s)]
*  So you could do a five minute set. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3412.36s)]
*  And a lot of times that set is going to get canceled. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3414.36s)]
*  So you'd work for free. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3417.36s)]
*  Work for free. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3419.36s)]
*  And then never get compensated. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3420.36s)]
*  No. You either sometimes get a spot or sometimes didn't. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3422.36s)]
*  Wow. So you'd work for free for 10 hours. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3425.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3428.36s)]
*  For a five minute spot. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3429.36s)]
*  That may not happen. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3430.36s)]
*  Well that will fucking weed out the week. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3432.36s)]
*  Yeah but like not like my family life was so dysfunctional that that seemed normal. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3436.36s)]
*  I was like this seems like okay this seems average to me. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3441.36s)]
*  Just used to disappointment. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3445.36s)]
*  Yeah you just used to it. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3447.36s)]
*  You're like this seems average. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3448.36s)]
*  This seems like what I've been dealing with. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3450.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3451.36s)]
*  Well you found your tribe. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3453.36s)]
*  I found my tribe. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3456.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3457.36s)]
*  Wild tribe. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3460.36s)]
*  It's just so interesting when you meet someone like Ari like when I met him at the very beginning and to see him now. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3462.36s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3467.36s)]
*  It's fascinating watching these broken toys meander their way through our society. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3468.36s)]
*  It's funny me and him were talking last night at your club and he was just talking about like I guess dating people and stuff and he's like well you and I are broken. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3474.36s)]
*  I was like what are you talking about? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3483.36s)]
*  He's like Adrian. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3486.36s)]
*  He's like nobody's going they want to date somebody like you. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3487.36s)]
*  He's like you need a lot of time to yourself. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3491.36s)]
*  And I was like oh he's not wrong. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3494.36s)]
*  And he's the same way too. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3496.36s)]
*  Like he just he was telling me about like this couple he had met that they live they're married 40 years but they live in different houses. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3498.36s)]
*  And he's like they have a great relationship. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3506.36s)]
*  They don't fight about like the little things that a lot of people do when you live together. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3508.36s)]
*  He's like they have a great relationship. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3512.36s)]
*  And I was like that's not the worst idea. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3513.36s)]
*  It's not the worst idea. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3515.36s)]
*  The idea that you have to be in the same house together. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3518.36s)]
*  It's like says who. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3520.36s)]
*  People like a little space. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3522.36s)]
*  Yeah I mean at one point I had a two bedroom apartment. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3524.36s)]
*  Me and my ex-boyfriend slept separately. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3526.36s)]
*  I mean we were also had a terrible relationship but like we had our own bedrooms. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3528.36s)]
*  Like I wouldn't be opposed to that. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3532.36s)]
*  It doesn't seem like the worst thing in the world. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3535.36s)]
*  But whenever you see a couple when they don't sleep in the same bed anymore you're like oh. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3537.36s)]
*  I know we all judge them but I'm like they're sleeping great. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3541.36s)]
*  That's Mark's room over there. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3545.36s)]
*  I sleep over here. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3548.36s)]
*  I know but if you say it like that's his room this is my room. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3549.36s)]
*  I think you got to figure out how we were saying it. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3552.36s)]
*  Yeah and then also some people like to sleep in the room really fucking cold. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3555.36s)]
*  That shit's annoying if you don't like that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3560.36s)]
*  I like I like like a fan all year round. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3563.36s)]
*  I like the noise. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3565.36s)]
*  The noise. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3566.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3567.36s)]
*  There's something about like static noise that does help you sleep. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3568.36s)]
*  Yeah I just like it. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3571.36s)]
*  I like the sound of an air conditioner like in the summer. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3573.36s)]
*  I slept at this house in Malibu once by the ocean. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3576.36s)]
*  And I rented it out for a couple of months. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3580.36s)]
*  And when you're in bed and you just hear the shh. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3584.36s)]
*  That sounds like really relaxing. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3588.36s)]
*  It is. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3591.36s)]
*  So it's weird. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3592.36s)]
*  It's like it's like hypnotic. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3594.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3596.36s)]
*  And it's also it's so powerful. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3597.36s)]
*  You're you're you're laying down at the base of just insane force of nature. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3599.36s)]
*  This immense body of water and you've got the audacity to sleep at the edges at the edges where this impossible amount of water laps up. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3606.36s)]
*  That's where you want to put your house. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3617.36s)]
*  I've had nightmares about like just a tsunami just like engulfing my house. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3619.36s)]
*  I'd love being at that place but it was very illuminating. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3624.36s)]
*  It's very illuminating why rich people want to live like right on the water in Malibu because I was like why do they want to live right next to each other like that. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3627.36s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3633.36s)]
*  And then you like rent a house there and you're like oh I get it. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3634.36s)]
*  This is like magic. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3638.36s)]
*  There's something magic about the water. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3640.36s)]
*  I would love to live on a beach. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3641.36s)]
*  It's magic. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3643.36s)]
*  It's like it gives you magic energy. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3644.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3646.36s)]
*  Is there something about it like being right there. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3647.36s)]
*  It's like wow this feels it feels like I'm on a drug. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3649.36s)]
*  And it's so calming. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3652.36s)]
*  So calming. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3653.36s)]
*  But at night time it's terrifying. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3655.36s)]
*  The same water that looks so inviting in the daytime. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3657.36s)]
*  What's blue and you see the seagulls and it's beautiful at night time it becomes an angry monster that can swallow civilization just dark dark black. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3660.36s)]
*  You don't know what you can't see anything. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3672.36s)]
*  You don't know what it's an immense thing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3674.36s)]
*  And at any point in time the earth could just a little shift and a fucking big one comes in. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3677.36s)]
*  And just all the way to Arizona. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3685.36s)]
*  I think anything at night is a lot scarier. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3688.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3691.36s)]
*  I got come home three o'clock at night and off the park two blocks away. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3692.36s)]
*  I'm just like I'm like you know pepper spray in my hand and I have the whole thing. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3694.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3699.36s)]
*  Whereas during the day it's like just different. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3700.36s)]
*  I know the different things. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3702.36s)]
*  Some things are really scary but only in certain circumstances like babies are never scary. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3704.36s)]
*  But if you were in a moonlit forest and you walk through the forest you saw a naked baby just staring at you by itself you would shit your pants. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3712.36s)]
*  I would definitely not help it. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3723.36s)]
*  If you saw a baby just standing upright just looking at you naked. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3725.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3728.36s)]
*  In the middle of nowhere you had to hike in and you see a naked baby like I got to get the fuck out of here. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3729.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3736.36s)]
*  First I'd be like where's this kid's parents. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3737.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3739.36s)]
*  For sure. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3740.36s)]
*  For sure you'd be where this kid's parents. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3741.36s)]
*  But you'd also be like why is there a naked baby staring at me like a grown person. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3742.36s)]
*  It's got to be evil. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3746.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3748.36s)]
*  Anything at night like that it's evil. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3749.36s)]
*  You would think it's a demon. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3751.36s)]
*  And during the day you're like look at this baby it's standing. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3752.36s)]
*  If I was a demon I would disguise myself as a baby. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3754.36s)]
*  It's a good move. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3756.36s)]
*  Everybody thinks you're cute. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3757.36s)]
*  Or a cute dog. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3759.36s)]
*  Or a cute dog. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3760.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3762.36s)]
*  Definitely not that whippet. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3763.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3765.36s)]
*  They were kind of cute. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3766.36s)]
*  They still had a cute face. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3767.36s)]
*  You know they didn't have a mean like pit bull looking face. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3768.36s)]
*  They had a cheap whippet face. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3770.36s)]
*  I would pick something else over it. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3772.36s)]
*  They have cows like that too. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3773.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3774.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3775.36s)]
*  When not on Jack they look like greyhounds. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3776.36s)]
*  Yeah they do. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3777.36s)]
*  Whippets are really fast too. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3778.36s)]
*  Wait. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3779.36s)]
*  That looks like a greyhound. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3780.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3781.36s)]
*  Real similar. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3782.36s)]
*  So what is the difference? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3783.36s)]
*  Look at that little cutie. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3784.36s)]
*  It's this myostatin inhibitor gene. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3785.36s)]
*  This gene is fucked up on some of them. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3786.36s)]
*  Oh it's related to the greyhound. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3787.36s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3788.36s)]
*  It looks a lot like it. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3789.36s)]
*  And apart from its smaller size closely related to the greyhound. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3790.36s)]
*  It's a little bit bigger. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3791.36s)]
*  It's a little bit bigger. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3792.36s)]

*  It's a little bit bigger. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3818.36s)]
*  That they have to do. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3820.36s)]
*  Kids have had it too. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3821.36s)]
*  Human kids have gotten it. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3822.36s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3823.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3824.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3825.36s)]
*  You see like a baby that looks like a body builder. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3826.36s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3827.36s)]
*  It's a deficiency. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3828.36s)]
*  Deficiency. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3829.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's a myostatin inhibitor. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3830.36s)]
*  Myostatin deficiency, WIPPID type, is inherited muscular disorder affecting WIPPIDs. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3831.36s)]
*  Dogs that inherit two copies of the mutation associated with myostatin deficiency, WIPPID [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3835.96s)]
*  type, have broad chest and overly developed muscles, especially of the neck and legs, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3840.36s)]
*  as well as an overbite. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3844.88s)]
*  See if you can find that in cows. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3846.4s)]
*  Myostatin, just write myostatin cows. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3849.4s)]
*  Yeah, so look at that cow. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3852.4s)]
*  Look at the size of that dairy cow. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3855.4s)]
*  That's a girl. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3856.4s)]
*  Look how jacked she is. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3857.4s)]
*  I wonder if that's more attractive to the bulls. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3858.4s)]
*  I wonder, right? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3863.2400000000002s)]
*  Are they like that one's hot? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3864.2400000000002s)]
*  Bulls that are in the, like a guy who's in a CrossFit chicks? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3865.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3867.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3868.88s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3869.88s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3870.88s)]
*  Look at the size of that goddamn thing. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3871.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3873.88s)]
*  Look at the protein myostatin. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3874.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3876.88s)]
*  So, myostatin, I guess, is what regulates muscle growth. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3877.88s)]
*  And if you don't have it, it's not regulated. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3882.88s)]
*  That's why they were experimenting with that with human beings too. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3885.88s)]
*  And I know, I'm sure, like Eastern black countries are doing that for the Olympics and shit like [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3889.88s)]
*  that. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3894.88s)]
*  I would imagine. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3895.88s)]
*  But, yeah, they did it to mice. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3896.88s)]
*  Look at the musculature on these mice. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3898.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3900.88s)]
*  What's crazy is they just skin these mice and we don't give a fuck. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3901.88s)]
*  If I see one of those in my house, I'd move out. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3903.88s)]
*  Look at the fucking back on that dude. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3906.88s)]
*  What they've done, like people have been born with it too. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3909.88s)]
*  I know that there was like a German boy that was born with it. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3914.88s)]
*  He was fucking jacked, like a little kid. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3917.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3920.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3921.88s)]
*  So, like how's that kid going to play sports? [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3922.88s)]
*  Like what's going to happen? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3924.88s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3925.88s)]
*  It's like you're playing sports with the Hulk. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3926.88s)]
*  I mean. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3929.88s)]
*  We'll find out in like 15 years. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3930.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess we will. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3932.88s)]
*  Like he's like the greatest running back of all time. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3934.88s)]
*  I just like playing chess. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3936.88s)]
*  I really don't want to be on the football team. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3938.88s)]
*  He's like the Hulk playing chess. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3940.88s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3942.88s)]
*  Maybe he rebels because everybody wants him to get into physical pursuits. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3943.88s)]
*  He's like fuck you. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3946.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3947.88s)]
*  Look at that kid. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3948.88s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3949.88s)]
*  Vietnamese boy. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3950.88s)]
*  So he's got it. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3951.88s)]
*  That dude's going to be popular in high school. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3952.88s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3955.88s)]
*  Nuts. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3957.88s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3958.88s)]
*  Imagine going to school with that kid. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3959.88s)]
*  You'd be so jealous. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3961.88s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3962.88s)]
*  Wouldn't you love it if he's your brother though and anyone picks on you? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3963.88s)]
*  Unless your brother wants you to fucking eat shit. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3966.88s)]
*  Well, that's true. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3969.88s)]
*  He makes you eat shit, but he also sticks up for you at school. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3970.88s)]
*  Yeah, if he's a good brother. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3972.88s)]
*  But if your brother's mean and he's got that, you're fucked. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3974.88s)]
*  I feel like you torture your brother or sister, but you don't let somebody else do it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3977.88s)]
*  I know guys that had terrible brothers who beat them up all their life. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3983.88s)]
*  But do they let other people also beat them up? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3989.88s)]
*  If someone's beating you up, but they protect you from being occasionally beaten up by others. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3992.88s)]
*  That's the price you pay. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3998.88s)]
*  I'm not willing to make that. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=3999.88s)]
*  You used to sleep in the same fucking house as that asshole. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4001.88s)]
*  Yeah, but your parents hopefully are there sometimes and they're stopping it sometimes. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4004.88s)]
*  Oh, now you're unrealistic. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4008.88s)]
*  He's going to make a fighter. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4010.88s)]
*  Yeah, you do make fighters. That's what I'm talking about. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4012.88s)]
*  A lot of the guys that I'm talking about are fighters. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4015.88s)]
*  They were just really beaten up by their brothers. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4017.88s)]
*  And they're the scariest guys because they're not afraid to fight because they fought their whole life. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4020.88s)]
*  And it doesn't matter if they're little either. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4024.88s)]
*  They're scrappy. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4026.88s)]
*  Yeah, one of the best guys ever in the UFC, Matt Hughes, former welterweight champion, had a brother who was his twin. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4028.88s)]
*  And they were both like elite wrestlers and they both just beat the fuck out of each other. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4035.88s)]
*  And it led to him becoming the UFC welterweight champion of the world and one of the greatest of all time. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4041.88s)]
*  I mean, that is it's just like the guy that went to prison. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4046.88s)]
*  It can happen that way. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4049.88s)]
*  Yeah, a negative turned into a positive. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4050.88s)]
*  Yeah, I can see it that way. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4052.88s)]
*  I knew another dude, though, he got beat up by his brother and just destroyed his confidence his whole life, his whole life. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4057.88s)]
*  I became friends with them like in my 20s and that sucks. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4063.88s)]
*  It was a bummer, man. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4066.88s)]
*  He could just like not get past it. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4067.88s)]
*  He couldn't, you know, I wonder if he had never done MDMA. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4069.88s)]
*  I had neither at the time. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4073.88s)]
*  I wonder if that would have helped him in any way to just recognize what the root of it was. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4075.88s)]
*  But it just like really fucked with his confidence. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4078.88s)]
*  He would get like really close to getting good at stuff. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4081.88s)]
*  But he almost had like this self-defense, self-sabotage thing that would kick in because everybody had already always taken things from him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4084.88s)]
*  Like it had always been like he thought things were going to go well and his brother just fucked it up and beat him up or took things from him, humiliated him. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4092.88s)]
*  And so he never felt like real success. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4100.88s)]
*  So he's always scared to get to like progress in life. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4104.88s)]
*  So he'd always self-sabotage his life because he just thought everything was going to turn to shit. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4108.88s)]
*  But he was a good guy and a smart guy and just trapped by this childhood, you know, repeated beatings that he got. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4112.88s)]
*  All right, well, maybe it's not great always. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4121.88s)]
*  Maybe it's not always going to turn out well. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4124.88s)]
*  Sometimes it's good, though. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4127.88s)]
*  Sometimes it's good. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4128.88s)]
*  If the brother is a good guy, if you're both good people, like, you know, brothers fight and they make up and they apologize. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4130.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4136.88s)]
*  Just like friends do. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4137.88s)]
*  You know, friends fight and make up when you're young. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4138.88s)]
*  Me and my sister would fight a lot. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4142.88s)]
*  Fist fight? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4144.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4145.88s)]
*  We were three years apart. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4146.88s)]
*  I remember my mom was like still hitting me until I was like about 16. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4147.88s)]
*  And then at one point I was like, hey, I'm going to hit you back. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4152.88s)]
*  And then she stopped because at some point you become almost like. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4154.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4157.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4158.88s)]
*  But that's kind of how like we grew up. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4159.88s)]
*  Like my mom got into a fist fight at my sister's kindergarten graduation. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4161.88s)]
*  Like I'm like, you're fighting over fucking kindergartners. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4164.88s)]
*  No one cares. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4168.88s)]
*  They've accomplished nothing. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4169.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4170.88s)]
*  I watched a shooting over a high school football game. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4171.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4175.88s)]
*  I saw that too. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4176.88s)]
*  That was terrible. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4177.88s)]
*  Oh, so horrible. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4179.88s)]
*  So sad. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4181.88s)]
*  Just such a fucking just a terrible thing where just people with their kids and emotions and sports, people get so nutty with their kids with sports. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4183.88s)]
*  You know, I am I like like big on saying you did a great job and cheering and stuff. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4196.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4203.88s)]
*  But I would never yell about the other team. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4204.88s)]
*  And some parents are like, what about him? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4207.88s)]
*  What about offense? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4210.88s)]
*  What about what about that foul? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4211.88s)]
*  What about that foul? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4213.88s)]
*  He's a cheater. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4214.88s)]
*  He's yelling like that's a six year old. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4215.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4219.88s)]
*  Are you out of your fucking mind? [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4220.88s)]
*  Like let him play. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4221.88s)]
*  It's his play. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4222.88s)]
*  You should clap when they do a good job. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4224.88s)]
*  She said, was it fun? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4226.88s)]
*  Did you enjoy it? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4228.88s)]
*  Was it hard? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4229.88s)]
*  Was it hard to make that goal? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4230.88s)]
*  Talk to them. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4232.88s)]
*  But don't get too goddamn emotionally invested in a fucking game your kids in. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4233.88s)]
*  Like cheer. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4238.88s)]
*  Be enthusiastic for them. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4239.88s)]
*  But fuck. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4241.88s)]
*  People get so high. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4242.88s)]
*  That's a bad call. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4244.88s)]
*  And they jump up. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4245.88s)]
*  And next thing you know, gunshots. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4246.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4247.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4248.88s)]
*  Now you've really ended the game. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4250.88s)]
*  There's no way to even recover from this right now. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4252.88s)]
*  You've ended your whole life. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4254.88s)]
*  You've ended your whole life. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4256.88s)]
*  Your whole life is fucked. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4257.88s)]
*  Well done. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4258.88s)]
*  I think too sometimes like parents also think they can push their kids to be like great athletes and then they'll be famous. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4259.88s)]
*  So. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4266.88s)]
*  Well there's also like your kids going to do the thing that you didn't do. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4267.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4270.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4271.88s)]
*  You wanted to do but you didn't do it. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4272.88s)]
*  It's interesting is my mom kind of got me into stand up because she did stand up and then she quit. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4274.88s)]
*  And then she got me into it. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4279.88s)]
*  And then when she saw I was doing some stuff she was like I'm going to go back into it. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4280.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4284.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4285.88s)]
*  Is she doing it now? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4286.88s)]
*  She does. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4287.88s)]
*  She does a lot of urban rooms. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4288.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4289.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4290.88s)]
*  Is she good? [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4291.88s)]
*  She's funny. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4292.88s)]
*  I mean like we're a little bit different but like she still has that same dark sense of humor but she won't. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4293.88s)]
*  She doesn't really do those jokes. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4296.88s)]
*  Like sometimes she'll think of something and she's like you could do this. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4298.88s)]
*  Like one time we were clothes shopping and she'll always say something like if she'll take two larges and she's like well one large might be bigger than the other because the kids that are making them maybe one of the kids was tired. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4301.88s)]
*  Like so she'll say stuff like that. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4314.88s)]
*  And she's like I can't say it on stage but you should. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4316.88s)]
*  So she'll do stuff like that. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4319.88s)]
*  My whole family was funny though growing up. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4321.88s)]
*  So was that just when when did you first think about doing stand up? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4324.88s)]
*  I was probably like in my early 20s. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4330.88s)]
*  Like I always wanted to be on SNL. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4333.88s)]
*  I never really wanted to do stand up comedy. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4334.88s)]
*  I wanted to be on SNL. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4337.88s)]
*  And then my mom was like well if you want to be on SNL you have to like do stand up. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4338.88s)]
*  So I just started doing stand up and I started liking it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4343.88s)]
*  But like I didn't want to be a stand up comic as a kid. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4345.88s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4348.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4349.88s)]
*  What was it like was who was the people on SNL like what era was this? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4350.88s)]
*  Will Farrell. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4355.88s)]
*  You know Chris Farley those guys. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4357.88s)]
*  Like that was the people that I kind of grew up with and loved. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4359.88s)]
*  Molly Shannon. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4363.88s)]
*  Sherry O'Tary like that whole crew. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4364.88s)]
*  Yeah that was a great crew. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4367.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4368.88s)]
*  So that's kind of where I was like oh I want to do that. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4369.88s)]
*  And she was like well you have to do stand up. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4371.88s)]
*  And I had zero interest in doing it. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4373.88s)]
*  Had you done any drama or anything in school? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4374.88s)]
*  You know we did like plays as kids. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4377.88s)]
*  I was like in the sound of music I played that lady. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4379.88s)]
*  A doe, a deer, a female deer. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4385.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4387.88s)]
*  So like I did stuff like that. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4388.88s)]
*  But I just I don't know I was kind of like a class clown as a kid. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4390.88s)]
*  So then I wanted to do that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4394.88s)]
*  And now I'm like not really the same as that. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4396.88s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4398.88s)]
*  Because you get it all out on stage? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4399.88s)]
*  No but I'm just saying I was like a class clown but I was also like loud and like boisterous where I'm not that same person anymore. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4401.88s)]
*  Or I don't think I am anyway. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4409.88s)]
*  What calmed it? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4411.88s)]
*  I don't know I think just depression. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4413.88s)]
*  I don't know I think as a kid I just even though my life looking back was not ideal I still felt really happy. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4418.88s)]
*  You know like I didn't realize like all the issues as a kid really. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4425.88s)]
*  So I don't know. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4430.88s)]
*  And then where did you start out? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4433.88s)]
*  Oh New York City. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4436.88s)]
*  I'm from New York. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4438.88s)]
*  I've lived in the Bronx my whole life. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4439.88s)]
*  So I started in New York. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4440.88s)]
*  So it's also weird too because you're like starting in a place where people don't move until they're really good. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4441.88s)]
*  So I started in New York just being shitty. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4447.88s)]
*  Where did you start? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4450.88s)]
*  Did you start at a bar or where did you start? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4451.88s)]
*  The first place I went to was in Brooklyn. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4453.88s)]
*  It was I guess an open-way. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4455.88s)]
*  It was in like a big Italian restaurant. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4458.88s)]
*  There were four people there. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4460.88s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4462.88s)]
*  2004. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4463.88s)]
*  My mom was there. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4465.88s)]
*  My mom went on. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4466.88s)]
*  She did well. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4467.88s)]
*  And then I went up and I was like so high energy because I was so nervous. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4469.88s)]
*  I remember one of my jokes was about like I was working in the South Bronx as a crimes victims advocate at the time. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4474.88s)]
*  And I got pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt while someone was selling drugs right near me. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4480.88s)]
*  And I was like just the lunacy of it. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4484.88s)]
*  I was like why am I getting this guy's clearly selling drugs to somebody. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4486.88s)]
*  That was like one of my first jokes. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4490.88s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4492.88s)]
*  And then when you got off stage did you think this is something I'm going to do more of? [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4494.88s)]
*  Yeah I think because that show went well even though there were four people. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4500.88s)]
*  I was like I'm going to keep doing this. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4504.88s)]
*  That show went well and there's four people. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4506.88s)]
*  There were four people. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4508.88s)]
*  And it was in a huge Italian restaurant that was like closing. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4509.88s)]
*  Like they were like going out of business. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4512.88s)]
*  So there was nobody there. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4515.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4516.88s)]
*  And so then when was the next one? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4518.88s)]
*  I didn't wait that long. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4521.88s)]
*  Maybe a couple days later. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4522.88s)]
*  I remember like driving into Manhattan and going to do this open mic called Collective Unconscious. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4523.88s)]
*  And it's like wild. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4529.88s)]
*  Like there was a guy there at one point that had like elephantitis. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4531.88s)]
*  So he would go on stage naked and his balls were humongous and he had like this tiny dick in it. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4534.88s)]
*  He was making people uncomfortable because he was naked the whole show. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4540.88s)]
*  Like sitting in the audience and people were like you got to wear clothes until you get on stage. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4544.88s)]
*  And he was like all right. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4551.88s)]
*  But like he would just be sitting there like his bare ass is on the chair. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4552.88s)]
*  Right so people were like hey can you put your clothes on? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4556.88s)]
*  What if I drop a chip? [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4558.88s)]
*  Yeah can you just wear your clothes until you're on stage doing that. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4559.88s)]
*  But that was like a weird collection of people. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4564.88s)]
*  Yeah I would imagine a guy that would fit in there. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4567.88s)]
*  Just everything like you know. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4570.88s)]
*  Where the only requirement would be just wear your clothes until you get on stage. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4571.88s)]
*  And not at first. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4575.88s)]
*  They let him do that until he was creepy. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4576.88s)]
*  So like if he didn't act like a creepster he could have just been naked the whole time. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4578.88s)]
*  Act like a creepster. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4583.88s)]
*  Yeah but like they were okay with it at first. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4584.88s)]
*  They were like all right. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4587.88s)]
*  And it's not like he did anything great on stage. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4588.88s)]
*  It was just seeing his huge balls. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4590.88s)]
*  Which is nuts. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4593.88s)]
*  I don't know how you're like. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4594.88s)]
*  How big? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4595.88s)]
*  Elephant tights they're like this big. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4596.88s)]
*  They're huge. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4598.88s)]
*  So like as big as a head. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4599.88s)]
*  Maybe like half of that. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4601.88s)]
*  Half a head. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4602.88s)]
*  Half a head for one though. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4603.88s)]
*  So like yeah maybe that whole thing. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4604.88s)]
*  And then like you can't even see the dick. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4606.88s)]
*  What do you want to see if you feel bad for him? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4611.88s)]
*  I didn't even feel bad. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4614.88s)]
*  I was just like gross. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4615.88s)]
*  I don't really care about your fucking big balls. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4618.88s)]
*  Did you find out about the different mics from your mom? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4620.88s)]
*  No. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4623.88s)]
*  I went on to like there was a couple of websites you go on to where they have a bunch of different open mics and you can do a couple. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4624.88s)]
*  And I remember it was a lottery. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4632.88s)]
*  So if there's 30 people and you get picked first you can pick where on the lineup you want to go. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4634.88s)]
*  And I would just pick like 30 because I was so nervous. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4638.88s)]
*  I'd just stay there for hours. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4641.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4644.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4645.88s)]
*  It's an interesting group of people though. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4646.88s)]
*  And then sometimes my mom would come to come with me and at that time I was dating a guy who would also come so the three of us would go. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4647.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4654.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4655.88s)]
*  Were they encouraging? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4656.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4658.88s)]
*  You mean my mom? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4659.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4660.88s)]
*  And the guy you're dating? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4661.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4662.88s)]
*  I mean me and him met we were both brand new and then my mom was encouraging because I think she was just like well maybe you'll hit it and you'll help me. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4663.88s)]
*  And I was like it should be the other way around. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4668.88s)]
*  It's interesting people that you meet when you're doing open mics. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4671.88s)]
*  It's a fascinating introduction to like this weird world. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4674.88s)]
*  Of weirdos. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4679.88s)]
*  Of weirdos and desperation and mental illness. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4680.88s)]
*  Mental illness. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4684.88s)]
*  A lot of mental illness. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4685.88s)]
*  Like really nutty people. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4686.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4689.88s)]
*  And you could do anything there. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4690.88s)]
*  So you could not only do comedy you could do like poetry you could sing. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4691.88s)]
*  So it was like a variety open mic kind of. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4695.88s)]
*  Wow. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4699.88s)]
*  And you can get upstairs and show your balls. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4700.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4703.88s)]
*  That guy was doing that. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4704.88s)]
*  Did anybody ever try to do that that had regular balls after that? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4705.88s)]
*  Because imagine if they found out there's a place you could just get naked in front of people and they had to look at you. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4708.88s)]
*  I mean not while I was there I never seen anyone that was like following him with like regular balls. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4713.88s)]
*  They're like here's the big ball guy and now the small ball guy. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4719.88s)]
*  Yeah I mean like that's what I'm asking like once a precedent is set that you could be on stage naked. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4722.88s)]
*  Like is it only if you look weird? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4726.88s)]
*  I think they would let you do whatever you wanted there as long as it wasn't like creeping people out. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4729.88s)]
*  Like they'd probably let you go on stage and spread your ass cheeks and stuff in it. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4734.88s)]
*  Like I think they would be open to whatever you wanted to do but you had to try. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4738.88s)]
*  You were just you could set a precedent every time you know. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4742.88s)]
*  Thank God for people like that running those kind of establishments. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4746.88s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4749.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4750.88s)]
*  And you know there was a lot of like you know my mom would come sometimes she'd be like that guy's really talented but he would just be like an alcoholic. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4751.88s)]
*  She'd be like he's not going to go anywhere. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4757.88s)]
*  I never seen him after that but like yeah a lot of people in comedy it's not the funniest people that make it. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4758.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4764.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4765.88s)]
*  I remember a lot of people that were really talented in the early days. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4766.88s)]
*  I'm like why is this guy not making it? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4769.88s)]
*  And then there was a lot of people that were really talented and then they were on their way to making it like they were doing well and headlining and then they just fell apart. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4771.88s)]
*  Like something in their life happened or like. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4778.88s)]
*  Yeah schizophrenia like there's that with some of them you know or some other sort of mental disease. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4781.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4787.88s)]
*  You know sometimes people crack. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4788.88s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure involved. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4791.88s)]
*  I was thinking that just that just the pressure of constantly performing doing sets writing new material is having to sell tickets doing radio. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4793.88s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4802.88s)]
*  There's a lot of stress in that and then I think for some people when things start getting more and more hectic whatever problems that they and as you get older to like people that are like tend to have mental illnesses they exacerbate they get better. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4803.88s)]
*  They get worse rather when they get older. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4815.88s)]
*  I could see that especially if it's not treated. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4817.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4820.88s)]
*  So a lot of these people like you would meet them and then you know you did open mics together like you you're in the trenches together start out and then you see him like 20 years later. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4821.88s)]
*  And it didn't work like they you know see him at an open mic night again and they're still doing kind of the same material. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4832.88s)]
*  I've seen that too. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4838.88s)]
*  People that were really talented and they just you know lost it to drugs or alcohol or you know like oh that's a shame because that person definitely could have went far. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4839.88s)]
*  How many people out of the starting class of you where you were at where the people you remember in the early days are still around. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4848.88s)]
*  A bunch. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4856.88s)]
*  I mean I don't know. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4857.88s)]
*  I guess I went to a lot of different open mics and shows so there's a lot of people I kind of started with I guess. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4859.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4867.88s)]
*  I guess I remember like some I've watched I've also watched people quit and I've seen the moment they've quit. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4868.88s)]
*  I remember being at a show and this guy was like humping the stool and this other guy couldn't get on the show and he saw that and he's like I can't believe I can't get on the show. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4875.88s)]
*  And then that guy who I thought would have went far because he was he was talented. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4884.88s)]
*  I mean not hoping the stool wasn't great but like he was talented and then like all the clubs he worked at closed and he quit like he didn't just go to another club he just was like all right I'm going to sell real estate. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4889.88s)]
*  You have to be really mentally ill to stay the path. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4898.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4904.88s)]
*  That's why I think I did all that stuff and just thought it was a shame. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4905.88s)]
*  I didn't think like I shouldn't be treated like this. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4908.88s)]
*  Yeah I didn't have a path that was nearly as hard. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4911.88s)]
*  I was really lucky that in Boston in the 1980s there was a lot of open mic nights at legitimate clubs. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4914.88s)]
*  So I started Stitches which is a legitimate club in Boston was a great club and on the open mic nights not only was it an open mic night but it was hosted by a professional. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4920.88s)]
*  This guy George McDonald. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4930.88s)]
*  And then a lot of really good professionals from town would stop in so you get to see people that was so much better than you. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4932.88s)]
*  You can see like these brilliant comedians. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4938.88s)]
*  And so it was a real good scene for development because all the clubs had an open mic night. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4941.88s)]
*  Every club had an open mic night. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4947.88s)]
*  Was there audience or was it just. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4949.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4950.88s)]
*  Oh okay. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4951.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4952.88s)]
*  Yeah you would go to an open mic like the when I went to an open mic night there was a lot of people. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4953.88s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4957.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4958.88s)]
*  It was good. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4959.88s)]
*  It was good because first of all they called it comedy hell. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4960.88s)]
*  It was George McDonald who was a known stand up in Boston. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4963.88s)]
*  So he was like headlining all over the place. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4966.88s)]
*  Anyway so people knew who he was and then he would go on and he was like a real veteran. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4968.88s)]
*  He'd been doing comedy forever and he was one of the guys that came up through the ding ho and you know that whole when stand up stood out documentary. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4972.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4980.88s)]
*  That was all about those guys. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4981.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4982.88s)]
*  And so you could always get people that would go because he would always be funny anyway. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4983.88s)]
*  It's only like fucking five bucks to get in or something like that and you go and have a couple of drinks and hopefully somebody funny will come by. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4987.88s)]
*  And you as an open mic or got to go on stage in that environment. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4993.88s)]
*  It was incredible. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4998.88s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=4999.88s)]
*  You mean a lot of comics that like took you on the road. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5000.88s)]
*  No no. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5002.88s)]
*  I mean I think it was a lot of fun. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5004.88s)]
*  I mean I think it was a lot of fun. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5006.88s)]
*  No no. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5008.88s)]
*  Mostly what happened was I did well enough in open mics that one guy took me on the road. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5009.88s)]
*  That was actually George's brother Warren Warren McDonald took me on the road. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5018.88s)]
*  That was the first time I ever got paid and the second time I ever got paid. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5021.88s)]
*  Someone had introduced me to this guy Mike Clark who is Lenny Clark's brother. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5024.88s)]
*  So I got to open for Lenny Clark the second time I ever got paid. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5029.88s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5034.88s)]
*  It was insane. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5035.88s)]
*  He had already done HBO and Lenny you know was super sweet to me said I'm really funny gave me a bunch of advice. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5036.88s)]
*  Then his brother started using me. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5043.88s)]
*  So his brother would use me to open in these like weird little bar shows all over the all over like the New Hampshire area of Connecticut. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5045.88s)]
*  He had like gigs everywhere and you would go and do these fucking crazy bar shows. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5053.88s)]
*  So I learned how to do stand up from mostly from going on the road mostly doing bar shows. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5059.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5064.88s)]
*  So like a year in I was just traveling doing a half an hour. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5065.88s)]
*  That's how people are standing up outside of New York. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5068.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5071.88s)]
*  Didn't you say you don't like performing in Connecticut. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5072.88s)]
*  Connecticut sucks. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5074.88s)]
*  Do you know I did like a charity show there and I got taken off stage. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5075.88s)]
*  Ah. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5079.88s)]
*  They pulled you off stage. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5080.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5081.88s)]
*  For what. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5082.88s)]
*  So. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5083.88s)]
*  Oh I heard about this. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5084.88s)]
*  That was Connecticut. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5086.88s)]
*  That was Connecticut. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5087.88s)]
*  So what happened. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5088.88s)]
*  So I was like 500 people there. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5089.88s)]
*  There's I guess they were making it was for kids that were like you know less fortunate I guess giving them food or you know opportunities or whatever. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5093.88s)]
*  And I was like I don't know how this is going to go. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5100.88s)]
*  So the girl before me is doing really well. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5104.88s)]
*  She did a joke about pedophiles. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5106.88s)]
*  I get on stage and I was like oh I wasn't going to do my joke about that. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5109.88s)]
*  But I was like oh these people love that joke that she did. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5112.88s)]
*  And this is allegedly. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5115.88s)]
*  So I don't I don't know exactly why but allegedly this is why I think I was taken off stage. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5116.88s)]
*  So I'm going up. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5121.88s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5122.88s)]
*  I'm getting like applause break. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5123.88s)]
*  So I'm like oh I could definitely do this joke. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5124.88s)]
*  And the joke is about how I want to be rich but not too rich. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5127.88s)]
*  I want to stop right before it's OK to fuck kids. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5132.88s)]
*  And these are very rich people and I didn't think they were that rich. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5135.88s)]
*  And one of the punch lines it's like about comparing like poor pedophiles to rich pedophiles and how like a poor pedophile is like a guy that works at UBS that fucks a kid and it's sad. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5141.88s)]
*  But like how rich people fuck kids and it's like a party. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5149.88s)]
*  You know they're on a boat high fiving each other. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5152.88s)]
*  And I did that joke and I lost a lot of the audience. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5155.88s)]
*  And I was like OK. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5157.88s)]
*  And then I did a couple more jokes and it was like definitely different in the room. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5159.88s)]
*  And then somebody came on stage and got me off. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5163.88s)]
*  And I was like what's weird is like everyone's like aren't you mad. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5165.88s)]
*  I'm like no this is not my first charity show I've done taken off stage. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5169.88s)]
*  Like I shouldn't do these shows and whenever people ask me I'm like I don't think I'm right for this. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5172.88s)]
*  How many minutes were you in before you told them? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5175.88s)]
*  15. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5177.88s)]
*  So you'd kill them for 15 minutes. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5178.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5179.88s)]
*  And I think I can definitely do this joke because this girl now her joke wasn't as specific. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5180.88s)]
*  But what I was told later is like allegedly there's a guy in the community who is a rich pedophile with a boat that was fucking kids in the community. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5185.88s)]
*  And I was like I'm like how why would I know that. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5194.88s)]
*  And I was like oh that makes a lot of sense. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5197.88s)]
*  Damn it if you didn't do that joke. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5200.88s)]
*  If I didn't do that joke I would have been fine because they liked me. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5202.88s)]
*  They really did like me. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5206.88s)]
*  Oh my God you were making fun of them and you're being mean to them. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5208.88s)]
*  I didn't think they were rich enough. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5210.88s)]
*  I didn't think they were fuck kids rich. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5212.88s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5214.88s)]
*  Well it was probably just one guy. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5215.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5217.88s)]
*  Well OK. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5218.88s)]
*  But maybe. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5219.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5220.88s)]
*  The pedophile or the rich people pedophile ring is one of the scariest conspiracies. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5221.88s)]
*  I mean so I get off stage. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5227.88s)]

*  This is the problem with Connecticut. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5413.88s)]
*  It's not a real state. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5414.88s)]
*  It's a highway between Boston and New York. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5416.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5419.88s)]
*  And the problem is there's no hope there. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5420.88s)]
*  Like nobody like hopes they move to Hartford. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5423.88s)]

*  Well there's a lot of rich folks that live in those havens right where everything's like [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5434.88s)]
*  tucked away and grand manors and huge houses and yes great Gatsby type shit. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5438.88s)]
*  There's a lot of those folks but they're just like people that have a house on an island. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5444.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5458.88s)]
*  If Connecticut like cease to exist nobody would care. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5459.88s)]
*  It's just a weird place because I mean I've met a lot of fun people from Connecticut but [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5461.88s)]
*  it's the place itself has a low vibration. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5467.88s)]
*  It's like there's not a lot of hope and exciting things. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5471.88s)]

*  Just made in a lab. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5547.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5548.88s)]
*  But they definitely do things like that in some countries. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5549.88s)]
*  Somewhere. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5552.88s)]
*  They definitely make bio weapons. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5553.88s)]
*  But whether or not Lyme disease is one of them. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5555.88s)]
*  But god damn that's a terrible one to get. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5557.88s)]
*  I know a lot of people that got Lyme disease. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5559.88s)]
*  But you don't die from it right? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5561.88s)]
*  You get fucked up if you don't get it treated quickly. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5562.88s)]
*  Like is it like physically debilitating? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5566.88s)]
*  Oh debilitating. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5569.88s)]
*  Depending upon you know the severity obviously. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5570.88s)]
*  But I know people that have had horrible joint pain neck pain spinal pain. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5572.88s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5577.88s)]
*  They're just in agony all the time. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5578.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5579.88s)]
*  And then people who just lost all of their all their like energy. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5580.88s)]
*  They just feel depleted. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5584.88s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5586.88s)]
*  And a lot of times they don't even recognize it in people. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5587.88s)]
*  Because if you don't get it treated. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5589.88s)]
*  If you don't get it diagnosed while you still have like there's like a bullseye ring around the tick bite. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5591.88s)]
*  When it initially becomes infected. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5597.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5599.88s)]
*  And if they don't catch that. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5600.88s)]
*  If they don't find that. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5601.88s)]
*  Then they don't know it's Lyme disease. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5603.88s)]
*  So they don't start treating you with antibiotics. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5605.88s)]
*  They might think oh you know seems fine. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5606.88s)]
*  Your vitals checked fine. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5608.88s)]
*  And then it progresses worse and worse. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5609.88s)]
*  And my friend's son was five years old. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5611.88s)]
*  And he developed Bell's palsy. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5614.88s)]
*  So his face went numb. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5615.88s)]
*  And then finally they realized it was it was a tick bite. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5617.88s)]
*  And finally they realized they had Lyme disease. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5621.88s)]
*  So they gave him antibiotics and he recovered. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5623.88s)]
*  My friend was fucked up for at least a year. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5625.88s)]
*  He had lost a shit ton of weight. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5628.88s)]
*  He got real skinny. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5630.88s)]
*  I mean it really wrecked him. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5632.88s)]
*  Lyme disease is rough. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5634.88s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5636.88s)]
*  And it's everywhere. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5637.88s)]
*  There are so many ticks that have Lyme. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5639.88s)]
*  It's all over the place on the East Coast. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5641.88s)]
*  I feel like that's not something in the Bronx. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5643.88s)]
*  I don't know if it's in the Bronx. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5645.88s)]
*  There's not a lot of grass in the Bronx. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5647.88s)]
*  But if there's deer. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5649.88s)]

*  If you see deer and a lot of other animals there's ticks. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5655.88s)]
*  Anyplace where there's ticks you might have Lyme. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5658.88s)]
*  If there's deer in the Bronx they're lost. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5660.88s)]
*  There's a story about a deer that was like in Locust Point. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5663.88s)]

*  That's what people call it. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5705.88s)]
*  Well guess what? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5706.88s)]

*  He's on a street. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5709.88s)]
*  He doesn't know he's in Bronx light. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5710.88s)]
*  He doesn't know that. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5711.88s)]
*  He thinks he's in the Bronx. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5712.88s)]
*  But he's not. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5713.88s)]
*  He's in Bronx light. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5714.88s)]

*  Okay. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5718.88s)]
*  We're aware of that. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5719.88s)]
*  Over the last several decades coyotes have been expanding their natural range in response [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5720.88s)]
*  to ample food and open habitat the Parks Department said in the statement. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5722.88s)]
*  Coyotes are living within the city limits. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5726.88s)]
*  We're aware of coyotes living in the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5728.88s)]

*  How about that? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5733.88s)]
*  Might have to kill a coyote. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5734.88s)]
*  If you kill them they just make more babies. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5735.88s)]
*  That's why they're here. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5738.88s)]
*  That's literally why they're here. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5740.88s)]
*  When you kill coyotes the female coyotes know that one of them is missing so they make more [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5741.88s)]
*  pups. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5746.88s)]
*  I mean you don't think someone, you think they know this one's in the Bronx by itself? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5747.88s)]
*  I don't think it's by itself. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5750.88s)]
*  You think it's with other people. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5751.88s)]
*  100%. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5752.88s)]

*  They're pack animals. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5755.88s)]
*  They're also cute too. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5756.88s)]
*  Until they're jumping over a fence with your chicken in their mouth. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5757.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5760.88s)]

*  But it is really cute. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5767.88s)]
*  It looks like a dog. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5768.88s)]
*  Well if you live here you can carry a gun. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5769.88s)]
*  The coyote runs up on you. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5770.88s)]

*  I would love a gun. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5778.88s)]
*  But I think I would, I couldn't have it in the Bronx. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5779.88s)]
*  No. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5781.88s)]

*  Unfortunately. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5783.88s)]
*  That's not why. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5784.88s)]
*  I would just anytime someone did something. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5785.88s)]

*  Can you see like mansions? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5861.88s)]
*  There's like one area of Connecticut where my friend that I was talking about earlier [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5864.88s)]
*  actually works at a school there. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5868.88s)]
*  He lives in Connecticut. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5870.88s)]
*  And he said like all these people are billionaires. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5871.88s)]
*  They all have like these preposterous houses. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5874.88s)]
*  I mean that's so much of a house to keep up with. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5877.88s)]
*  It definitely is. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5881.88s)]
*  I guess you're rich though so you're not keeping up with the- [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5882.88s)]
*  It's not like a website that details them. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5884.88s)]
*  Because they're like pretty famous for being extravagant. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5885.88s)]
*  And they're also, everyone's keeping up with the Joneses. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5887.88s)]
*  So there's like, you know, the guy who's the CEO of Biotech down the road. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5890.88s)]
*  He's got a bigger house. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5894.88s)]
*  We're going to expand our pool. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5895.88s)]
*  And so they're all going ham. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5897.88s)]
*  You got to do something with that hedge fund money. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5899.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5902.88s)]
*  I don't know if I'd do that. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5903.88s)]
*  What would you do? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5905.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5906.88s)]
*  Am I still doing comedy? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5907.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5916.88s)]
*  Not all animals obviously. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5917.88s)]
*  I should have brought Marshall. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5918.88s)]
*  I didn't know. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5919.88s)]
*  You should have brought Marshall. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5920.88s)]
*  I didn't know you're such an animal lover. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5921.88s)]

*  I know. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5925.88s)]
*  Ari's saying that aren't you guys going to bring your dogs to go play? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5926.88s)]

*  His dog, Bandit, she's awesome. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5934.88s)]
*  He's awesome. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5935.88s)]
*  He calls it a girl sometimes, but I think it's a boy. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5936.88s)]
*  No, I think it's a girl. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5937.88s)]
*  Is it? [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5938.88s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's a girl. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5939.88s)]
*  He calls it a boy sometimes too, though. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5940.88s)]
*  You know. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5941.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5942.88s)]
*  It's a girl though. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5943.88s)]
*  He makes out with it. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5944.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5945.88s)]
*  He's making out with my dog. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5946.88s)]
*  I took my dog here also. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5947.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5948.88s)]
*  That is weird. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5949.88s)]
*  I don't even, he could die. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5950.88s)]
*  Ari would be okay with that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5951.88s)]
*  I think Ari feels like he lives his life to the fullest, and if he died at any point, [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5954.88s)]
*  he'd be like, okay. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5958.88s)]
*  I bet he'd be shitting his pants the last few hours. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5959.88s)]
*  Like if he was on that submarine. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5962.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5964.88s)]
*  Those people finally died, I think. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5965.88s)]
*  Well, we're not going to know. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5967.88s)]
*  What they said is that if they made it all the way to the bottom, unfortunately, the [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5970.88s)]
*  bottom is just mud, undulating mud, and they might have just sunk right into it. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5973.88s)]
*  It's horrific. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5981.88s)]
*  It's horrific. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5983.88s)]
*  When you hear that they've had moments in the past where they lost contact for hours [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5984.88s)]
*  with other subs, and they're still doing it the same way, that whole thing is so insane. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5990.88s)]
*  That sub can't pilot itself. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5997.88s)]
*  There's no line attached to it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=5999.88s)]
*  It just goes down. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6000.88s)]
*  It's a remote control that's controlling it. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6001.88s)]
*  The boat has to be above it for it to work. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6003.88s)]
*  What's interesting to me is these people down there to go see the Titanic, if you told me [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6005.88s)]
*  I could watch that on TV, I still wouldn't want to watch it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6010.88s)]
*  I can't imagine doing that. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6013.88s)]
*  Brian Simpson pointed this out yesterday. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6014.88s)]
*  This is what's even more insane. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6016.88s)]
*  They're not even seeing it through a big window. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6018.88s)]
*  All right, you were saying that. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6021.88s)]
*  They're seeing it through screens. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6022.88s)]
*  There's cameras on the outside of it, and as they pilot it around, they're seeing it [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6024.88s)]
*  on screens. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6027.88s)]
*  There's one small window. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6028.88s)]
*  What is the point? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6030.88s)]
*  People like to do dangerous shit to say they did dangerous shit. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6032.88s)]
*  They want to experience things. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6036.88s)]
*  They want to go to the bottom of the ocean and see the Titanic. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6037.88s)]
*  I know, but there's a billionaire, but who are the other people that were with him? [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6040.88s)]
*  One of them was one other guy's son. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6045.88s)]
*  He was a 19-year-old son. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6047.88s)]
*  Fucking Jesus Christ. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6049.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6051.88s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6052.88s)]
*  It's so scary. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6054.88s)]
*  What a scary way to die. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6057.88s)]
*  I know, and it's like it's your own fault. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6059.88s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6062.88s)]
*  You chose to do that. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6063.88s)]
*  Not only that, there was a small window of time where they could do it because the weather [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6064.88s)]
*  was really bad. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6067.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6068.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6069.88s)]
*  Didn't they also make it themselves? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6070.88s)]
*  No, this company has sent, I think, was it 100 voyages? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6073.88s)]
*  They've done 100 voyages. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6078.88s)]
*  No, but I'm saying the actual submarine. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6079.88s)]
*  Didn't they make this? [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6082.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6083.88s)]
*  There weren't people saying they got it at stuff at Home Depot. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6084.88s)]
*  Well, there's a company that built it, and the company, apparently, there was a whistleblower [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6086.88s)]
*  who had complained that the hull was not really established to be able to tolerate [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6092.88s)]
*  the amount of pressure that they were putting it under by several thousand feet. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6099.88s)]
*  A remote operated vehicle found five major pieces of debris from the submersible about [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6104.88s)]
*  16,000 feet from the bow of the Titanic, the Coast Guard said, oh, they're dead. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6110.88s)]
*  The debris is consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6115.88s)]
*  Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said, he said, it's not yet clear when the implosion [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6119.88s)]
*  took place. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6124.88s)]
*  The family of those on board were immediately notified about the discovery. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6125.88s)]
*  We're now believing that our CEO Stockton Rush, Shazda Dawood and his son, Sulaimand [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6129.88s)]
*  Dawood, Hamish Harding, and Paul Henry Nargallalt have sadly been lost. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6136.88s)]
*  The Titan sub-operator Ocean Gate said in a statement, these men were true explorers [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6142.88s)]
*  who shared a distinct spirit of adventure and a deep passion for exploring and protecting [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6147.88s)]
*  the world's oceans. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6151.88s)]
*  Our hearts are with those five souls and every member of their families during this tragic [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6152.88s)]
*  time. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6156.88s)]
*  We grieve the loss of life and the joy they brought to everyone they knew. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6157.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6160.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6161.88s)]
*  It says they're unclear now if the victims can be recovered. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6162.88s)]
*  I don't think people even understand the scope of what you're searching for, like the amount [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6167.88s)]
*  of area you're talking about. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6174.88s)]
*  Yeah, and then I wonder if you also put more people in danger if you go looking for them. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6176.88s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6181.88s)]
*  You do. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6182.88s)]
*  I mean, this is, if that whistleblower was correct and it imploded because it wasn't [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6183.88s)]
*  really set up to tolerate the depths that they were putting it under, I mean, that is [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6189.88s)]
*  insane. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6194.88s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6195.88s)]
*  And it's so scary. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6196.88s)]
*  So scary that people would do that. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6199.88s)]
*  So scary that like there was they fired the guy who was the whistleblower. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6201.88s)]
*  And apparently there was a bunch of other people that complained as well. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6206.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6209.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, it was a serious thing. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6210.88s)]
*  What was the pull up that article again that we looked at? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6211.88s)]
*  It was it's not like everyone was like, we all agree this is safe. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6215.88s)]
*  There was quite a few people that were like, this is not safe. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6220.88s)]
*  This is not the way to do it. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6223.88s)]
*  And they had said that they were cleared by one certain body of, you know, some some group [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6224.88s)]
*  that was examining them, but they hadn't been cleared by them. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6232.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6234.88s)]
*  Somebody proposed that to you when you'd be like, absolutely not. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6236.88s)]
*  Fuck that. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6238.88s)]
*  Fuck that whistleblower raised safety concerns about Ocean Gate submersible in 2018. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6240.88s)]
*  Then he was fired. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6245.88s)]
*  Original carbon fiber hull wasn't rated for Titanic depths, claimed the operations director. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6246.88s)]
*  It is interesting to go look for the Titanic and then you also have the same fate as the people on the worst fate. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6252.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, because you actually knew what you were doing. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6260.88s)]
*  You're actually going to the bottom in a submarine. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6263.88s)]
*  They were on something they thought was going to float. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6265.88s)]
*  They were going to like drink tea and like look out of the icebergs and shit. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6267.88s)]
*  Well, also the rich, a lot of rich people, I think, made it off. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6272.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6275.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6277.88s)]
*  Apparently the company had plans to make 3D scans of it. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6280.88s)]
*  That's the first time I've heard of that. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6283.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's what they were doing there, but that's what the company's goal was at some point. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6285.88s)]
*  Make 3D scans of the Titanic? [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6290.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6292.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6293.88s)]
*  So they could recreate it somewhere? [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6297.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6298.88s)]
*  The exact. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6299.88s)]
*  VR, computer. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6300.88s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6302.88s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6303.88s)]
*  What is honestly the purpose of doing that? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6304.88s)]
*  People have to do things. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6308.88s)]
*  They'll have to do difficult shit. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6309.88s)]
*  I know, but it's like do something else. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6313.88s)]
*  I know, I know, but you can't tell people that. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6315.88s)]
*  That's true. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6317.88s)]
*  Like, you know, you can't tell people, hey, stop climbing Everest. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6318.88s)]
*  Stop. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6321.88s)]
*  That's true. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6322.88s)]
*  But at least you're doing that by yourself. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6323.88s)]
*  You kind of know the risks. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6325.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6326.88s)]
*  I mean, this also seems crazy. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6327.88s)]
*  If somebody's like, would you want to do this? [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6328.88s)]
*  I'd say no. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6329.88s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6330.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6331.88s)]
*  But you know, what makes people skydive? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6332.88s)]
*  What makes people ride bulls? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6335.88s)]
*  Thrill seekers. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6336.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6337.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6339.88s)]
*  I guess I would, if I was into doing those things, I know right away I'm going to probably like, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6341.88s)]
*  I know exactly what could happen, but something like that where someone's like, hey, this is totally safe. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6345.88s)]
*  We're all going to be together. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6350.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6352.88s)]
*  I just. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6353.88s)]
*  You fucked that. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6354.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6355.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's not totally safe. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6356.88s)]
*  There's no way it's totally safe. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6357.88s)]
*  Hey, Jamie, have you seen that bull that they call God mode? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6359.88s)]
*  Somebody sent me this video of there's this bull that they paid 25 million dollars for because it's so insane when they try to ride it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6364.88s)]
*  When you see what this bull does to the guy who's right, it's I didn't know a bull could do that. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6373.88s)]
*  I didn't know a bull could move that way. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6378.88s)]
*  Look at this bull. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6380.88s)]
*  The bull's name is God mode. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6383.88s)]
*  Watch how high the bull gets in the air. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6385.88s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6387.88s)]
*  But like you have to know if you do this, you might die. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6388.88s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6391.88s)]
*  But look at this guy trying to hang on to this bull. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6392.88s)]
*  Look at the height this bull's reaching. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6395.88s)]
*  I mean, that's that bull's flying. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6397.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6401.88s)]
*  Look at that bull fly. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6402.88s)]
*  I'm at some Michael Jordan of bulls. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6405.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6407.88s)]
*  Look at the height it's getting. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6408.88s)]
*  That thing's six feet in the air, seven feet in the air. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6409.88s)]
*  It is cute. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6411.88s)]
*  It's adorable. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6412.88s)]
*  It looks like he's going back. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6413.88s)]
*  I think it's a video, not this, but there's a 20 girls standing in a bull ring and they just let a bull go. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6415.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6423.88s)]
*  And they're all like a couple of them got jacked. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6424.88s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6425.88s)]
*  What is wrong with these? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6426.88s)]
*  I don't even take the subway in Manhattan. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6427.88s)]
*  Why would I ever do anything like this? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6429.88s)]
*  This bull is still jumping and no one's on him anymore. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6431.88s)]
*  How are you going to what are you going to do? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6435.88s)]
*  You ain't doing shit. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6437.88s)]
*  You ain't doing shit. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6438.88s)]
*  But just the fact that the bull keeps jumping like that, even after no one's on him. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6439.88s)]
*  Like, get the fuck off me. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6443.88s)]
*  That's why he's got no. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6445.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6446.88s)]
*  But people want to ride that thing. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6447.88s)]
*  There's someone out there going, fuck it. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6449.88s)]
*  I'm a ride God mode. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6450.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6452.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6454.88s)]
*  Not you, huh? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6455.88s)]
*  No. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6457.88s)]
*  Why would I do that? [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6458.88s)]
*  This is a song by Zach Brian. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6459.88s)]
*  It's a great song called Open the Gates. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6461.88s)]
*  And it's about a guy who died riding a bulls and his son goes and rides the same bull and dies. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6463.88s)]
*  I mean, it's like, what do you think is going to happen? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6470.88s)]
*  It's a great song. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6473.88s)]
*  The song sounds great, but I mean, come on. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6474.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6476.88s)]
*  What is going to happen? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6477.88s)]
*  This sounds like some TikTok stuff. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6478.88s)]
*  We saw it go crazy, but I can't find anything else online that says a bull was sold for 25 million, name God mode. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6480.88s)]
*  Well, that could be hardcore shit. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6487.88s)]
*  But whatever that bull can do is like, Jesus Christ, those guys, that's a rough life. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6489.88s)]
*  That's a rough life bull riding. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6494.88s)]
*  That is for me below getting sex traffic. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6496.88s)]
*  I'm like, send me in a container somewhere. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6502.88s)]
*  I don't fucking I don't trust this bull. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6504.88s)]
*  It's so weird what people choose to do with their life. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6507.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6511.88s)]
*  I mean, I guess, too, if you're a real thrill, thrill seeker and you keep doing bigger and bigger things, it must be the same way like you get endorphins from it. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6512.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6518.88s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6519.88s)]
*  There's also like the culture of it, I guess, like who's the biggest risk taker? [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6521.88s)]
*  Yeah, I guess. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6525.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6527.88s)]
*  Kind of like Bobby's going to do it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6528.88s)]
*  He's fucking crazy. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6529.88s)]
*  That's right, boys. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6530.88s)]
*  But that guy might even be scared. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6531.88s)]
*  He's like, I got to fucking do this now because everyone is like, it's fake. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6533.88s)]
*  Well, not fake, because obviously we saw the video, but the most expensive bull sold is one point five million. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6537.88s)]
*  Aha. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6543.88s)]
*  In 2020, that one doesn't look like, but is that a breeding bull or is that a riding bull? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6544.88s)]
*  Even still, I would say a riding bull would be less valuable than a breeding bull, wouldn't it? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6549.88s)]
*  Because you're just riding it for a couple of weeks and then you have to sell so many tickets to get the money back. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6554.88s)]
*  Well, I would imagine that riding bulls don't get hurt very often. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6559.88s)]
*  They only work six seconds at a time. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6563.88s)]
*  Right. But I bet they can do that any time they want. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6565.88s)]
*  Sweet. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6568.88s)]
*  Like if you just see them a couple of days off, I bet the riding bulls get right back after it. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6569.88s)]
*  I don't think I'm good. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6571.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the riding bull is worried about that little puny person riding its back. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6572.88s)]
*  Why is it worth 25 million? [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6576.88s)]
*  Because it's so preposterous that everybody's going to want to see God mode and everyone's going to see God mode's children. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6578.88s)]
*  That's what they do with those things. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6584.88s)]
*  I know, but that's what they do with those things. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6587.88s)]
*  Those riding bulls, when they're really dangerous, they breed them. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6589.88s)]
*  They breed them just like they do with dogs. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6593.88s)]
*  They breed the most dangerous ones with the most dangerous ones. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6595.88s)]
*  It makes them the most wildest bucking, insane, psycho bull, because that's what everybody wants to see you ride. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6598.88s)]
*  I just don't think they're worth that much. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6604.88s)]
*  I believe you. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6606.88s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure it's some TikTok shit. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6607.88s)]
*  This is a dumb question. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6609.88s)]
*  How do you determine which bulls are going to be riding bulls like that and which ones are just going to be beef bulls? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6610.88s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6615.88s)]
*  I wonder if it's a specific type of bull. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6616.88s)]
*  Does he just act crazy at birth and they're like, that's the bull? [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6618.88s)]
*  How do you know? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6621.88s)]
*  We made people ride bulls on Fear Factor. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6622.88s)]
*  It was one of two times in the history of the show where I was trying to tell the producers, don't do it. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6624.88s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like a bad idea. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6629.88s)]
*  I was like, don't do it. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6631.88s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6632.88s)]
*  They said it's a stunt bull. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6633.88s)]
*  That's the stunt guys get to say, he's a stunt bull. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6634.88s)]
*  I go, that bull does not know he's a stunt bull. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6638.88s)]
*  No. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6640.88s)]
*  That's a fucking bull. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6641.88s)]
*  They're like, hey, tone it down for this. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6642.88s)]
*  And the bulls try trying to get out of the cage before the people got on it. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6643.88s)]
*  And I was like, no way. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6646.88s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6648.88s)]
*  Because you could get stomped. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6649.88s)]
*  You 100% could get kicked in the face and it'll change your life. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6650.88s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6655.88s)]
*  Wouldn't that also be a huge lawsuit for a Fear Factor? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6656.88s)]
*  100%. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6658.88s)]
*  And they just don't care. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6659.88s)]
*  They rolled the dice. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6660.88s)]
*  They rolled the dice. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6661.88s)]
*  I guess, yeah. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6662.88s)]
*  That's what they did. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6663.88s)]
*  The other time I told them not to do it, the people had to drink cum. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6664.88s)]
*  But at least you're not going to die from. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6667.88s)]
*  I mean, it's gross. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6670.88s)]
*  You can't die from too much cum, can you? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6671.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6673.88s)]
*  I mean, you could definitely die if a bull steps on you, though. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6674.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6677.88s)]
*  Yeah, you wouldn't die. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6678.88s)]
*  Did they do that episode of drinking cum? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6679.88s)]
*  They did. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6681.88s)]
*  How much cum? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6682.88s)]
*  A lot. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6683.88s)]
*  Like a beer stein full of cum. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6684.88s)]
*  Like this much? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6686.88s)]
*  More. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6687.88s)]
*  Like that? [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6688.88s)]
*  Donkey cum. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6689.88s)]
*  So someone's just jerking these donkeys off? [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6690.88s)]
*  You know why donkey cum? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6692.88s)]
*  Why? [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6693.88s)]
*  Because donkeys don't breed. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6694.88s)]
*  Because donkey cum's not good for anything. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6696.88s)]
*  Because donkeys are a hybrid of a mule and a horse. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6699.88s)]
*  So this is people that drink donkey piss and donkey cum. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6704.88s)]
*  Geez, I'm going to throw up right now. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6707.88s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6709.88s)]
*  Do these people have to keep it down? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6710.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6712.88s)]
*  No, they throw it up eventually. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6713.88s)]
*  After they swallowed it, then they were allowed to throw up. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6714.88s)]
*  So somebody for this show had to jerk off donkeys. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6717.88s)]
*  They actually stick a cattle prod up their asshole, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6720.88s)]
*  and they shoot like a fire hose. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6723.88s)]
*  Well, at least someone doesn't have to jerk them off. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6725.88s)]
*  That would be a shitty job. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6728.88s)]
*  Yeah, they do something where they stick it up his asshole, [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6729.88s)]
*  and just yikes. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6732.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6734.88s)]
*  I know. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6735.88s)]
*  That's gross. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6736.88s)]
*  It's gross. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6737.88s)]
*  I got to be honest though, was it mixed with water? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6738.88s)]
*  It seemed very liquidy. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6739.88s)]
*  No, it was thick. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6740.88s)]
*  It was thick. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6741.88s)]
*  It seemed liquidy. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6742.88s)]
*  I thought it would be more like a milkshake consistency. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6743.88s)]
*  Yeah, then these guys are chucking. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6745.88s)]
*  So someone got ahold of the footage, like TMZ or something like that, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6747.88s)]
*  and then NBC pulled the episode from America, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6752.88s)]
*  but they didn't pull it overseas. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6756.88s)]
*  So I think it aired in Holland or somewhere like that. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6758.88s)]
*  Find out where it aired. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6761.88s)]
*  Well, the Fear Factor YouTube channel is where it is. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6762.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, you can definitely get it on YouTube. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6765.88s)]
*  But that was a kill the show. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6767.88s)]
*  Then they're like, that's a wrap. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6771.88s)]
*  So they canceled that episode. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6772.88s)]
*  That was the end of the show? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6773.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6774.88s)]
*  They canceled that episode. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6775.88s)]
*  They never aired that episode, then they canceled the show. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6776.88s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6778.88s)]
*  Over Donkey Kong. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6780.88s)]
*  Isn't that nuts? [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6781.88s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6782.88s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6783.88s)]
*  It was perfect. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6784.88s)]
*  Oh, gross. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6785.88s)]
*  Perfect way to end. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6786.88s)]
*  Yeah, and nobody saw it except in Holland. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6787.88s)]
*  A lot of people saw it on YouTube though. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6790.88s)]
*  I didn't even know it existed. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6792.88s)]
*  We've talked about it a gang of times. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6793.88s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6794.88s)]
*  So more people ever saw it than they would have seen it if it was on TV, for sure. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6795.88s)]
*  Is it, I don't know, is it worse to be the person that like drank all that [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6799.88s)]
*  cum and then it didn't air? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6804.88s)]
*  No, it's probably better. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6805.88s)]
*  But it did air. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6808.88s)]
*  But didn't you say it aired only in Holland? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6809.88s)]
*  Yeah, but it airs on YouTube. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6812.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6813.88s)]
*  I'm trying to find out. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6814.88s)]
*  Drinking cum on YouTube is, you're going to get some hits. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6815.88s)]
*  You're going to get some views. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6817.88s)]
*  Imagine on a job interview and they're like, did you drink that Donkey cum? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6818.88s)]
*  Were you one of the twins? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6822.88s)]
*  Because it was twins. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6823.88s)]
*  And you're like, no, that's my sister. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6824.88s)]
*  My sister did it. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6825.88s)]
*  So one had to drink piss, the other one had to drink cum. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6826.88s)]
*  What would you drink? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6829.88s)]
*  Piss. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6831.88s)]
*  Cum is chunky. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6833.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6834.88s)]
*  A lot of protein. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6835.88s)]
*  I would imagine it would affect your everything in there. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6836.88s)]
*  Piss is just dirty water. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6841.88s)]
*  If you're drinking water, you're drinking dinosaur piss. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6843.88s)]
*  I love it. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6846.88s)]
*  Do you know that? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6847.88s)]
*  All water on Earth at one point in time, if you just think statistically, the hundreds [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6848.88s)]
*  of millions of years of dinosaurs were around, all that water at some point in time was filtered [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6853.88s)]
*  out of a dinosaur's dick. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6857.88s)]
*  That sounds insane and not true. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6859.88s)]
*  I think it's true. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6861.88s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6862.88s)]
*  Let's see. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6863.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6864.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6865.88s)]
*  All water. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6866.88s)]
*  How would you Google that? [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6867.88s)]
*  Is your work computer just like have the worst stuff on it? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6870.88s)]
*  Except for browser. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6874.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6876.88s)]
*  Well, how would you phrase that? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6877.88s)]
*  Every glass of water you drink originally was in dinosaur urine. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6879.88s)]
*  Dinosaurs drink the same water as us. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6883.88s)]
*  Or originally was dinosaur urine. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6885.88s)]
*  I want it to be urine. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6887.88s)]
*  I want it to be real specific. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6888.88s)]
*  All the water you drink came from dinosaur urine. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6893.88s)]
*  Just be ridiculous. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6895.88s)]
*  Well, the way I asked it, someone did ask the question you're asking. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6898.88s)]
*  You are drinking dinosaur pee every day. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6904.88s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6908.88s)]
*  Oh. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6909.88s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6910.88s)]
*  Yeah, you are drinking dinosaur pee every day. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6912.88s)]
*  Here's why. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6914.88s)]
*  From tech times. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6915.88s)]
*  The average American drinks four cups of water every day according to the US Department of Agriculture. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6916.88s)]
*  This is far short of the recommended eight glasses, blah, blah, blah. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6921.88s)]
*  Whether it's tap, filtered, bottled, sparkling, or sourced from the Himalayan glaciers and sparkled with gold dust, you are actually drinking the liquid waste of an ancient beast, says a science-centric YouTube channel, Curious Minds. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6923.88s)]
*  A video explaining this theory says that every small percentage of all the water in the world is available for drinking purposes. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6936.88s)]
*  But it's still a huge amount of water to provide for the needs of every human being that's ever walked on the surface of the Earth for the last 200,000 years. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6941.88s)]
*  Every year, around 121,000 cubic miles of water, about the equivalent of 42 Lake Superiors, falls down on Earth, constantly flows through the rivers, lakes, ground reservoirs, and everywhere else it passes through, including inside the guts of people and the animals that drink it. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6948.88s)]
*  So what do dinosaurs have to do with all this? [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6961.88s)]
*  Unlike humans, who have been on Earth for a tiny fraction of the 186 million years that dinosaurs ruled the planet, the beasts were here far longer than we have ever been. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6964.88s)]
*  In that long span of time, it's very likely that dinosaurs have drunk all the water available back then. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6974.88s)]
*  And then all the water available now is simply water that has passed through a dinosaur's kidneys, making its way through the never-ending water cycle. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6980.88s)]
*  That's crazy that dinosaurs were around for 186 million years. If you told me they were around for 100 years, I would have believed it. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6990.88s)]
*  I know nothing about dinosaurs. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=6997.88s)]
*  Yeah, they were around forever. If it wasn't for that rock, they'd still be around. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7000.88s)]
*  That's crazy. And now we get to drink their piss. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7003.88s)]
*  That's what's interesting about life on other planets. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7006.88s)]
*  If something like the dinosaurs does exist, it takes something like the Yucatan impact to kill them. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7008.88s)]
*  And then the little scrambly little rodents and shit eventually evolve to become humans. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7016.88s)]
*  But if that doesn't happen, forever and ever and ever, it's just dinosaurs fucking things up, and no one ever builds a house. No one ever gets a Tesla. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7022.88s)]
*  Just pissing. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7030.88s)]
*  Yeah, every time you go outside, raptors tear you apart. You live in tiny caves, and they try to find you in there, and they drag your kids out. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7031.88s)]
*  They send a little raptor in there, and they grab your kid by the feet. You crawl into little tunnels and holes as they nip at you and try to claw away at the rocks to get to you. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7039.88s)]
*  You never develop tools. You never develop anything. You barely stay alive. You probably go extinct. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7049.88s)]
*  Somehow that submarine thing sounds less worse than that. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7056.88s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7059.88s)]
*  Being torn apart by a raptor. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7060.88s)]
*  If you lived in that era, I think everything ate everything. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7062.88s)]
*  Probably. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7065.88s)]
*  And the only way you didn't get eaten if you were like a stegosaurus where you're just covered in armor just to keep things from eating you. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7066.88s)]
*  I mean, imagine what kind of fucking hard life you have to be living in to develop the kind of skin a stegosaurus has. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7072.88s)]
*  Just armor everywhere you are. Like a triceratops. Everywhere you are. Armor. Just to keep you from getting consumed. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7081.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7089.88s)]
*  Yeah. So that's the bright side of the impact. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7090.88s)]
*  I'm drinking dinosaur piss. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7095.88s)]
*  Yeah, we're drinking dinosaur piss, and that's the bright side of apocalypse caused by an asteroid impact. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7097.88s)]
*  It's not that bad. It's pretty good. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7102.88s)]
*  It's way better than dinosaurs still being around. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7104.88s)]
*  And it's way better than Donkey Kong. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7107.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7109.88s)]
*  Not that I know, but I assume this is better. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7110.88s)]
*  My coffee is dinosaur piss. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7113.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7114.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7115.88s)]
*  It makes for other crap. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7116.88s)]
*  No, just coffee. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7118.88s)]
*  You don't put anything in it? Like no milk or anything? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7120.88s)]
*  No, it's just black. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7122.88s)]
*  Black coffee is tough. I like to put something in it so it's not as sour. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7123.88s)]
*  I started getting into it when I became friends with my friend Evan Hafer who runs Black Rifle Coffee. It's like his company. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7127.88s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7135.88s)]
*  And he, well, there was a guy I had on a podcast a long time ago that was actually a coffee expert. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7136.88s)]
*  What was that gentleman's name again? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7141.88s)]
*  Giuliano. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7143.88s)]
*  Giuliano, right? Yeah, Peter Giuliano. Very interesting guy, but he's like a legitimate coffee expert. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7144.88s)]
*  And I always wanted to, I was like, I like talking to people that just know a lot about one thing. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7151.88s)]
*  Sure. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7155.88s)]
*  Like it's weird, like how much this guy knows about coffee. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7156.88s)]
*  And he brought a bunch of different coffees to sample and there's this Ethiopian coffees that tasted almost like they were lemony. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7158.88s)]
*  And you're drinking them all black, everything black. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7166.88s)]
*  Like he's like real coffee drinkers drink coffee black. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7169.88s)]
*  And so then my friend Evan, who runs Black Rifle Coffee, he's a real coffee nut. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7171.88s)]
*  Like he literally goes to these places where they grow it and samples the beans and like they have different kinds of roasts and blends and amazing stuff. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7177.88s)]
*  And he drinks everything black. And I just started drinking it black. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7186.88s)]
*  I think it's an acquired taste. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7188.88s)]
*  I've done it before. Like drink it black with nothing in it. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7191.88s)]
*  Like if I'm in a hotel and they don't have anything. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7195.88s)]
*  But I don't know. If the coffee is good quality, then you can. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7197.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7200.88s)]
*  For me anyway. But if it's like crappy. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7201.88s)]
*  Yeah, if they fuck it up, if they don't know what they're doing, they fuck it up. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7203.88s)]
*  But even if I go to a diner, I just drink black coffee. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7206.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7209.88s)]
*  I like it. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7210.88s)]
*  I don't know. Maybe I'll get there one day. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7211.88s)]
*  It's just the thing where I know it doesn't taste good, but it tastes good to me. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7213.88s)]
*  Like I like that sort of bitter warm liquid taste. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7217.88s)]
*  I like it. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7221.88s)]
*  I like tea with nothing in it. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7222.88s)]
*  I do too. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7223.88s)]
*  Yeah, but coffee is real bitter. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7224.88s)]
*  But tea with honey is better, isn't it? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7226.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7228.88s)]
*  But I don't mind that plain as opposed to coffee is like not great. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7229.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7233.88s)]
*  Well, I try to avoid sugar as much as possible. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7234.88s)]
*  And I feel like when I put, even if I put like sweetened low or stevia in something, [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7238.88s)]
*  it makes me want more sweet things. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7242.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, I get that. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7243.88s)]

*  Of course. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7245.88s)]
*  You know, so I just avoid it. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7246.88s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7248.88s)]
*  Whenever I can. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7249.88s)]
*  Definitely. That's why I try and cut the sugar out, because I'm like addicted to it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7250.88s)]
*  Everybody is. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7253.88s)]
*  I think it's like some people aren't though. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7254.88s)]
*  It's like people that could have one or two drinks. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7256.88s)]
*  Like I think certain people like process everything differently. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7258.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7262.88s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7263.88s)]
*  But sugar is in so many things. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7264.88s)]
*  You don't realize how much you love it. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7265.88s)]
*  It is. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7266.88s)]
*  You live off of it. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7267.88s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7268.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7269.88s)]
*  But like some people could have one cupcake. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7270.88s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7271.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7272.88s)]
*  And some people are like, I need to chase that sugar. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7273.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7275.88s)]
*  Have you, you said that, do you have, how many people in your, you have many people in your [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7276.88s)]
*  family that have had addictive personalities or addiction issues? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7281.88s)]
*  Addiction issues, yeah, for sure. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7284.88s)]
*  Drugs and gambling. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7285.88s)]
*  Drugs, gambling, drinking. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7286.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7291.88s)]
*  And also I think when your life isn't that great, you look for an escape. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7292.88s)]
*  So. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7296.88s)]

*  You know. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7298.88s)]
*  Are you worried that as your life gets greater and greater that you'll have less things to [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7299.88s)]
*  be upset about? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7304.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I think I have quite a few things to be upset about. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7305.4800000000005s)]
*  I think I'll never run out of stuff. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7308.56s)]
*  I asked my therapist if he thought I'd ever be cured and he laughed at me. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7310.88s)]
*  He goes, no. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7313.88s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7314.88s)]
*  He's like, absolutely not. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7315.88s)]
*  Maybe he just wants to keep you there. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7316.88s)]
*  Maybe, but I, he's not making that much off of me. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7317.88s)]
*  I think he would rather, he's like, I think he'd rather me be like in a good place over [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7321.24s)]
*  getting the little bit of money I give him. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7326.5599999999995s)]
*  But he's funny. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7329.24s)]
*  He's really a funny person. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7331.8s)]
*  Like, cause I did think I had a good childhood and then like I started going to him and he's [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7332.8s)]
*  like, you had a terrible childhood. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7337.32s)]
*  Like I literally said to him, I was like, I thought I had a good childhood because nobody [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7338.96s)]
*  molested me as a kid. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7341.84s)]
*  And he was like, no, he's like, actually if somebody did, they would have been showing [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7343.08s)]
*  you attention. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7346.28s)]
*  He was like, it would have been better. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7347.28s)]
*  Like he was joking though. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7348.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7349.28s)]
*  But I was like, I see what he's saying. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7350.32s)]
*  Like, yeah, me and my sister were just ignored. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7351.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7353.32s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7354.32s)]
*  I think I'll always have stuff to be upset about. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7355.32s)]
*  Stand-up comedy is such an interesting thing because everybody came from like a place of [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7359.5599999999995s)]
*  lacking, but everybody's thing, like everything that got them to that is different. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7363.28s)]
*  But the result is the same with all. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7370.5599999999995s)]
*  It's all just like, how do I figure out how to get these fucked up ideas into people's [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7372.78s)]
*  heads and elicit a response? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7377.599999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7380.400000000001s)]
*  But a lot of comics have a lot of mental illness. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7381.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7383.64s)]

*  Sure. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7385.64s)]
*  You know, you're pulling like, I feel like my family was always very funny because we [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7386.64s)]
*  were always struggling financially and just like with different stuff. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7390.68s)]
*  You just kind of always are funny and joking around. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7394.68s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7398.400000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't you rather prefer f**ked up people to joke around a lot to like stuffy people [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7399.400000000001s)]
*  in Connecticut? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7403.8s)]
*  I mean, it would have been nice if like we had money. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7404.8s)]
*  Like I think I would prefer having like some financial stability in terms of just having [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7408.8s)]
*  like laughs. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7413.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7414.72s)]
*  I mean, maybe not now because I do stand up, but like, yeah, when you're younger, I mean, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7415.72s)]
*  I also didn't realize how rich people were too until I went to college and seen like [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7420.28s)]
*  people have lots of money. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7424.24s)]
*  Like I didn't really realize that as a kid. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7425.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7430.56s)]
*  That's probably good. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7431.96s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7432.96s)]
*  I think it really f**ks people up when they're like they're poor and they're around rich [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7434.96s)]
*  people because it's like right there. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7439.52s)]
*  In the Bronx, there's like varying degrees. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7441.84s)]
*  Like when I was growing up, it was like varying degrees of poor. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7444.2s)]
*  You know, like some of my friend's parents did have a house, but like you're still in [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7447.4s)]
*  the Bronx. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7451.96s)]
*  It's not like, you know, Connecticut or. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7452.96s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7454.96s)]
*  But yeah, I didn't realize. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7455.96s)]
*  It's just slightly doing better poor. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7456.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7458.76s)]

*  And that's the superpower. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7467.32s)]
*  F**ked up childhood is the superpower. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7469.28s)]
*  Sure. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7470.92s)]
*  I see that. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7471.92s)]

*  I realize it sucks now. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7492.08s)]
*  You didn't realize it until you started doing therapy. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7493.84s)]
*  No, I realized it once I got older and realized like we should not be, you know, in a house [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7495.84s)]
*  where someone's dying in the living room. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7501.22s)]
*  You know, like, well, there's like her and then another aunt. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7503.4s)]
*  But yeah, this is not great. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7505.84s)]
*  We were going to Crescent, Pennsylvania. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7507.6s)]
*  That's like the worst. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7510.44s)]

*  When it doesn't go well. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7519.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7520.24s)]

*  Like I really love animals. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7525.44s)]

*  What was the first time? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7604.120000000001s)]

*  I don't know. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7606.72s)]
*  I was doing it about six months after like outside. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7607.72s)]
*  And then I think I waited to get vaccinated to do it inside. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7610.08s)]
*  Like the first vaccine maybe. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7613.24s)]
*  Did you have to get vaccinated? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7614.599999999999s)]
*  You had to be in those clubs too, right? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7616.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7619.24s)]
*  And I think I think you had to get I had to get vaccinated to definitely go to Europe [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7620.24s)]
*  when I went on that tour with Louie. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7623.72s)]
*  So we definitely need I think three at that point. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7625.12s)]
*  You got to get up. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7627.16s)]
*  You had to have a booster to go over there too. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7628.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7630.16s)]
*  You have three. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7631.16s)]
*  And I think the clubs you might have only needed two, but I'm not sure. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7632.16s)]
*  God. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7635.5599999999995s)]
*  There were some comics that refused to get vaccinated too. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7636.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7639.2s)]
*  There was a couple of them. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7639.88s)]
*  But I was like, I mean, when I took the vaccine, I was like, I'm not 100 percent confident [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7641.32s)]
*  in this. But I was like, but like whatever, I do want to work. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7646.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7649.04s)]
*  I was like, what am I going to do? [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7649.72s)]
*  Well, a lot of people did that. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7650.599999999999s)]
*  They made that choice because they wanted to work. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7651.92s)]
*  And it was very clear that it was going to stop you from working, especially in some [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7653.5599999999995s)]
*  jobs. You know, a lot of people were forced into it. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7658.0s)]
*  It didn't work out good. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7660.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7663.28s)]
*  What did you do? You get vaccinated? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7664.639999999999s)]
*  No, I got. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7666.16s)]
*  Which one did I get? Not the Johnson and Johnson. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7669.16s)]
*  That seemed like the worst one. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7671.0s)]
*  Where is like one vaccine? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7673.68s)]
*  You're like, why is this one? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7674.88s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like 65 percent protection, but it's all of it was shenanigans. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7676.2s)]
*  If you really study the actual paperwork on what the studies actually showed versus [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7680.88s)]
*  what they were saying, it showed it didn't stop transmission. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7686.8s)]
*  It didn't. One person in the fucking vaccine group died of covid. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7689.72s)]
*  I guess my thing is like, so does it work? [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7695.240000000001s)]
*  Like because we have antibodies now, like how does that work? [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7697.4800000000005s)]
*  It works initially. It works initially. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7700.6s)]
*  And it like for a lot of vulnerable people, it probably was a good idea to get vaccinated. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7702.68s)]
*  Old people, fat people, people that were that had various diseases. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7707.92s)]
*  Yeah. The problem is it didn't last for very long. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7712.56s)]
*  It didn't last for nearly as long as they wanted. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7715.92s)]
*  And then you get your second shot and that didn't last. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7717.6s)]
*  And now, unfortunately, what they're finding is through this latest study with the Cleveland [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7720.4800000000005s)]
*  Clinic, they showed that with their health care workers, the more vaccines they got, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7725.56s)]
*  the more they got covid. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7730.8s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of weird things that happen with your immune [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7732.96s)]
*  system. I get very sick from the vaccines. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7736.240000000001s)]
*  How bad? I think I don't remember which one fucked me up the worst, but like there was [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7738.96s)]
*  a time I was like home for two, three days where I was like, oh, I'm really sick. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7743.84s)]
*  I got fever. I was really sick. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7746.64s)]
*  And then I got covid and I was really sick from it. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7748.4800000000005s)]
*  But I was I feel like I wouldn't get any more. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7751.92s)]
*  I won't get any more boosters. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7754.280000000001s)]
*  I know people are like, I'm on five. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7755.72s)]
*  I'm like, great. That's good for you. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7757.360000000001s)]
*  You know, some people, it's fine. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7760.64s)]
*  Some people, I mean, it's like any other medication. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7762.72s)]
*  Some people, they take that medication. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7765.08s)]
*  They don't have any problems with it. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7767.04s)]
*  And then other people take it and they get wrecked by it. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7768.56s)]
*  And that's the problem with making something mandatory, where some people are going to [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7771.320000000001s)]
*  get wrecked by it. Like really bad vaccine injuries. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7775.68s)]
*  Those are real. We all know about them now. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7778.64s)]
*  We've all seen people dropped out of heart attacks that shouldn't be. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7780.8s)]
*  And then there's people that it might have saved their lives. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7784.6s)]
*  It's like that's an uncomfortable like sort of conversation that people that are [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7787.4400000000005s)]
*  against it have to have and people that are pro it have to have. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7794.160000000001s)]
*  You have to look at the actual data of what really did happen. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7796.84s)]
*  And it's particularly for like non vulnerable people like children. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7799.72s)]
*  It was not a good idea. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7803.92s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I just didn't understand. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7805.84s)]
*  Like, say you didn't want to get vaccinated and somebody is vaccinated. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7807.200000000001s)]
*  Then why does that matter? [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7809.92s)]
*  Like, because it didn't. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7811.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, also, there's a huge money to be made off the vaccines. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7812.68s)]
*  But there was also people wanted you to do what they did. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7815.88s)]
*  I did the right thing. You should do the right thing. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7818.240000000001s)]
*  You're selfish. You're not doing it. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7819.68s)]
*  And you know, I've heard that too. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7821.88s)]
*  It was like the one time in our lives we weren't allowed to be skeptical about [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7823.320000000001s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7826.280000000001s)]
*  Right. We're skeptical over everything else that they produce. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7827.92s)]
*  We should be. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7830.76s)]
*  Sure. They have a long history of criminal fines. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7832.04s)]
*  Yes. They've been fined fucking insane amounts of money for lying about drugs [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7835.16s)]
*  that went up crossing people their lives. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7841.0s)]
*  Was that was it doped up? [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7842.56s)]
*  Dope sick. Dope sick. Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7844.12s)]
*  Yeah. I didn't say it. But I know the whole story about the Sackler family. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7845.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you look at something like that and you're like, yeah, we [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7848.36s)]
*  should be questioning. They just paid their way out of it. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7850.88s)]
*  They paid their way out. They paid their way out of it. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7853.72s)]
*  Like they gave like six billion dollars and now they can't be prosecuted. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7855.6s)]
*  And they priced off so much money. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7860.16s)]
*  Oh, God. That's crazy. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7861.6s)]

*  You can lose six billion dollars and still be a billionaire. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7863.88s)]
*  Yeah. Easy. They did that with there was another medication that they did, Vioxx, [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7866.8s)]
*  that wind up giving people gave a friend of mine a stroke, but it gave like it [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7873.52s)]
*  killed 60,000, 50,000 people. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7878.96s)]
*  What is that for? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7881.280000000001s)]
*  It was an anti-inflammatory medication. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7882.080000000001s)]
*  It didn't even work well. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7884.200000000001s)]
*  And they knew it in their their internal emails. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7885.76s)]
*  They said there's going to be problems, but we think we'll do very well with this. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7890.04s)]
*  So they knew that it was going to cause cardiovascular issues with people. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7894.04s)]
*  They knew it was going to cause blood issues with people and strokes and shit. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7897.4s)]
*  And they still still released it and they got fined, but they got fined [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7900.56s)]
*  less than they made. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7904.56s)]
*  Yeah. So I think they made 12 billion and they got fined like five or something. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7907.4s)]
*  So you're like, I still have the surplus of billions of dollars. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7913.04s)]
*  Don't quote me on those numbers, but it's something to the point where like I [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7916.32s)]
*  could see you made money on this. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7919.84s)]
*  You still made money. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7921.2s)]
*  This is like, yeah, it didn't work. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7922.16s)]
*  It wasn't a good, it was like, there was other, there's other available [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7924.92s)]
*  things that work better. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7929.24s)]
*  It's just a spooky thing that they can do that. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7931.16s)]
*  It's spooky and that people just go along with it. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7933.64s)]
*  Well, Johnson and Johnson has that lawsuit against their powder. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7936.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7939.6s)]

*  guess, are putting it like, you know, in their private areas getting cancer. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7943.6s)]
*  So they have a big lawsuit for that. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7946.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7947.92s)]

*  Is it just talc? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7950.76s)]
*  Cause I know talc is not great for you. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7951.88s)]
*  It's like a mineral, right? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7954.200000000001s)]
*  What is talc? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7955.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7955.96s)]
*  I don't know, but I just know like, I used to use Johnson and Johnson powder all [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7956.52s)]
*  the time and I was like, oh, that's like something you would never even think of. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7960.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7963.6s)]
*  What is, um, what, what caused people to get cancer from that? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7964.6s)]
*  The Johnson and Johnson vaccine was the one I was going to take. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7970.280000000001s)]
*  I was supposed to. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7973.04s)]
*  That's the one Bridget got, I think. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7973.6s)]
*  The UFC had allocated like 150 vaccines for their employees and we were doing [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7975.16s)]
*  shows during the pandemic. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7980.76s)]
*  They had this total bubble situation where you got tested. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7981.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7985.52s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7985.72s)]
*  When, uh, when talc and powder is linked to cancer, it's important to distinguish [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7986.32s)]
*  between talc that contains asbestos and the talc that's asbestos free. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7989.84s)]
*  Talc that has asbestos is generally accepted as being able to [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7993.72s)]
*  cause cancer if it's inhaled. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7996.36s)]
*  What about, um, what was, so we'll just go to that stuff. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=7998.36s)]
*  Go to the lawsuit, Johnson and Johnson cancer lawsuit, baby powder. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8002.679999999999s)]
*  Cause it was something with women, right? [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8013.879999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8016.12s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8016.32s)]
*  So there's some sort of J and J lawsuit settlement. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8022.92s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8027.759999999999s)]
*  Johnson Johnson said on Tuesday that it had agreed to pay $8.9 billion to tens of [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8028.36s)]
*  thousands of people who claim the company's talcum powder produces product [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8034.5199999999995s)]
*  products cause cancer proposal that lawyers for the plaintiffs called a [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8037.96s)]
*  significant victory in a legal fight that has lasted more than a decade. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8041.44s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8045.5199999999995s)]
*  So are they still using the same talc though? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8046.04s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8048.8s)]
*  Or maybe they're just telling people, don't put it on your hoo-haw. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8049.76s)]
*  But didn't it say just breathing it in is bad? [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8053.0s)]
*  The propo, yeah. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8055.24s)]
*  The one with asbestos. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8056.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm trying to figure out why, why does this have asbestos? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8057.96s)]
*  The proposed settlement would be paid out over 25 years through a subsidiary, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8060.599999999999s)]
*  which filed bankruptcy to enable the $8.9 billion trust Johnson and [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8063.96s)]
*  Johnson said in court filings. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8068.64s)]
*  If a bankruptcy court approves it, the agreement will resolve all current and [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8069.96s)]
*  future claims involving Johnson and Johnson products that contain talc, such [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8073.5599999999995s)]
*  as baby powder, the company said. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8077.5599999999995s)]
*  So how is, it's ovarian cancer. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8079.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8082.08s)]
*  Okay. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8082.68s)]
*  Significant victory for the tens of thousands of women suffering from [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8083.28s)]
*  gynecological cancers caused by the J and J's talc based products. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8086.24s)]
*  So what is in it that's causing cancer? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8090.24s)]
*  And mesothelioma. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8093.5199999999995s)]

*  So what is it that causes cancer though? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8146.8s)]
*  Like what's it in the talc that's causing cancer? [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8148.76s)]
*  I guess the asbestos is in it. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8151.12s)]

*  way. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8159.16s)]

*  He recommended to senior staff in 1971 the company upgrade its quality control of [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8202.12s)]
*  talc. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8206.880000000001s)]
*  Two years later, another executive raised a red flag saying the company should no [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8207.720000000001s)]

*  The powder, he said, sometimes contains materials that might be classified as [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8214.28s)]
*  asbestos fiber. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8218.720000000001s)]
*  The carcinogen, which often appears underground near talc, has been a concern [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8220.08s)]
*  inside the company for decades and hundreds of pages of memos. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8224.04s)]
*  Executives worried about a potential government ban of talc, the safety of the [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8227.16s)]
*  product and a public backlash over Johnson's baby powder, a brand built on a [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8230.72s)]
*  reputation for trustworthiness and health. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8234.8s)]
*  And it had asbestos in it. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8237.76s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8240.28s)]
*  They took it out of the paint. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8240.68s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8243.04s)]
*  I think they're saying it's in the same mines as the talc. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8243.56s)]
*  They're like, let's just keep it up. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8246.2s)]
*  We'll just get it from the same mines. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8248.24s)]
*  They're cutting it just like the Mexican cartels cut the Coke with fentanyl. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8249.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8253.56s)]
*  Cutting it with talc. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8253.88s)]
*  Like if you have like a bunch of asbestos and you got a little talc is worth 10 [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8254.759999999998s)]
*  bucks a pound, cut it in there. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8259.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8262.199999999999s)]
*  I would be surprised if it's not in there. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8262.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8264.119999999999s)]
*  Isn't fentanyl expensive? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8265.039999999999s)]
*  Why are they mixing stuff with fentanyl? [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8266.359999999999s)]
*  It's very cheap and it's also really potent. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8268.119999999999s)]
*  So you need a very, very small amount of fentanyl. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8272.199999999999s)]
*  Well, fuck you up. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8274.64s)]
*  But I'm sure it's not consistent. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8277.519999999999s)]
*  They're not, you know, they're not really good at like quality control. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8279.439999999999s)]
*  And also I think sometimes they leak fentanyl laced cocaine specifically designed [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8283.560000000001s)]
*  to kill people to target rival gangs. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8287.52s)]
*  They do it like if one gang is selling Coke and they'll sabotage their supplies [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8290.28s)]
*  so that they kill their... [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8295.44s)]
*  People will stop buying it from them. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8296.68s)]
*  Uh huh. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8298.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8299.560000000001s)]
*  Or they use it to target certain people. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8300.76s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8303.720000000001s)]

*  And he was like, I was like, I don't know. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8346.72s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8348.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8355.960000000001s)]
*  The audiences are great. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8356.56s)]
*  Both shows were so fun. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8357.8s)]
*  And I, cause they were like, which room do you want to do? [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8359.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8360.8s)]
*  I was like, I got to see which one I like, but I like them both. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8361.88s)]
*  So. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8364.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8364.68s)]
*  They're both different, but really fun. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8364.88s)]
*  It's the whole setup is Louis actually helped me quite a bit. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8367.24s)]
*  Um, he gave me some really good advice when we were in the middle of construction. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8371.32s)]
*  He told me to make the stage in the small room, smaller. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8375.36s)]
*  It was larger. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8378.2s)]
*  They just designed the stage. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8379.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8380.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8380.68s)]
*  It was perfect. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8380.92s)]
*  What he designed was perfect. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8381.76s)]
*  He said, just cut off four feet on each side. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8382.92s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, why do we don't need it that big? [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8385.36s)]
*  And so it was really fun because you could kind of walk around in this, you [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8387.16s)]
*  know, once we had gutted it, you know, you're going, why don't we do this? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8392.28s)]
*  Why don't we do that? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8396.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8397.560000000001s)]
*  And so Louis came in and I just said, what, you know, what do you think? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8397.92s)]
*  And he was like, you know, like make this lower. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8401.480000000001s)]
*  He's like a good director. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8404.52s)]
*  He knows how to do all that stuff. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8405.880000000001s)]
*  I listened to everything he said. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8407.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8408.68s)]
*  Every, I took every single piece of advice that he said, every recommendation I did. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8409.0s)]
*  Do you like one room over the other? [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8413.6s)]
*  I love them both. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8415.400000000001s)]
*  They're different though. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8416.400000000001s)]
*  The little room is really intimate. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8417.160000000002s)]
*  The little room is like your party and you're having a good time with people. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8418.880000000001s)]
*  They're right there. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8421.6s)]
*  They're on top of you. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8422.240000000002s)]
*  It's really fun. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8423.12s)]
*  It's, it's also very honest. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8424.0s)]
*  Like if you feel performative or clunky, it feels gross in that room. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8426.2s)]
*  In the little one? [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8431.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8432.640000000001s)]
*  In the little room. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8432.84s)]
*  I feel like the little room is freer. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8433.320000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, it is. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8435.320000000002s)]
*  But I mean, if you do come off clunky, it's more obvious because it's very intimate. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8435.92s)]
*  It feels fake. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8441.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8442.84s)]
*  You know, it's just a different room. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8443.08s)]
*  The other room is, the other room is pretty intimate too. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8444.92s)]
*  The way I describe it is like, they're both like hybrids of the [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8447.400000000001s)]
*  Comedy Store original room and the Belly Room. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8450.12s)]

*  Next time I go, I'll bring you. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8459.36s)]
*  All right. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8460.560000000001s)]
*  Let's party. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8460.92s)]
*  Let's party. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8461.6s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8462.16s)]
*  What I do like about the big room is that it is intimate because everyone does seem [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8462.92s)]
*  pretty close to you, even though it's like a pretty big room. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8465.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8468.960000000001s)]
*  It's, we, it's well designed. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8469.400000000001s)]
*  We mean, we put a lot of thought into it. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8470.92s)]
*  We raised the floor. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8472.560000000001s)]
*  We had the stage set at the perfect height where it's like right at, right at table [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8474.480000000001s)]
*  height, no, not a bad seat in the room. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8478.0s)]
*  We were like meticulously went over it for a long time. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8480.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8483.36s)]
*  I think too, what I think Ari was saying last night is like, when you go to some [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8484.48s)]
*  clubs, sometimes like the owner shows up and it's just like, it changes the vibe. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8487.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8491.72s)]
*  It's like, that's not here. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8492.08s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, you're right. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8493.12s)]
*  It's not like you come around and people are like, Oh, put that away or let's stop [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8494.32s)]
*  talking about whatever we're talking about. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8497.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8499.2s)]
*  That happens in other clubs for sure. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8499.6s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8501.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8502.64s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8503.76s)]
*  There's only a few other clubs that are owned by comics. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8504.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8507.28s)]
*  I guess I'm just thinking about clubs and maybe Manhattan, you know? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8507.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8509.880000000001s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8510.48s)]
*  It's like, you're dealing with, there's like the owners, the owners tell the [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8511.2s)]
*  managers what to do, the managers tell the comedians what to do. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8514.720000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8517.16s)]
*  So there's still bosses. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8517.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8518.76s)]
*  Even though you are the boss or the owner, it's not like that vibe. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8519.480000000001s)]
*  No, the vibe is it's for all of us. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8522.880000000001s)]
*  It's our place. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8526.240000000002s)]
*  It's very welcoming. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8526.640000000001s)]
*  Like, I don't know most of the comics. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8527.400000000001s)]
*  Like I'm getting to know them, but I felt very welcome there. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8529.28s)]
*  If you're funny, it's very welcome. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8532.12s)]
*  If you're not funny, it's very unwelcoming. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8534.0s)]
*  If you're not funny, they're fucking brutal. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8535.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8538.04s)]
*  It was just, there's a lot of competition for stage time. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8538.640000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of comics. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8541.68s)]
*  There's a lot of young people. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8542.68s)]
*  Yeah, I could see that. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8543.92s)]
*  You know, all the staff like are aspiring comedians, like this door staff, and they [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8544.800000000001s)]
*  all auditioned with their actual comedy to get the jobs. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8548.92s)]
*  To be the door, like to work at the door. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8552.24s)]
*  That's actually pretty good. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8553.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8555.640000000001s)]
*  And they get stage time. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8555.880000000001s)]
*  So they get to go up and they go up to showcase nights, open mic nights, two nights [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8556.880000000001s)]
*  a week. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8561.4s)]
*  That's great. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8562.0s)]
*  Whereas I was interning for free. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8562.76s)]
*  Yes. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8564.68s)]
*  You don't have to do that here. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8565.08s)]
*  Still not getting a spot. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8566.28s)]
*  Then even more importantly, the creek in the cave is right next door. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8567.16s)]
*  It's right up the street. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8570.28s)]
*  And then you've got a sunset room, which is right next door. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8571.08s)]
*  Sunset, Brian Redband's room is three doors down. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8574.52s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8577.44s)]
*  And the other day we did a show, like last Thursday, we did a show at my club and then [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8577.76s)]
*  guys were going back and forth and Redband's show was sold out too. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8582.32s)]
*  And then there's the Vulcan, which is also just a half a block down. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8585.36s)]
*  And, you know, they do comedy there too. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8589.32s)]
*  And then you also have Cap City, which is in the domain. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8591.32s)]
*  And you have a bunch of little places like the Vel Vita room. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8594.4s)]
*  There's a bunch of spots that are all around town and all kinds of mics. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8598.4s)]
*  Do they do shows at Esther's Follies also? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8601.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8603.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8603.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8604.039999999999s)]
*  They do shows. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8604.28s)]
*  There's a lot of good comedy here. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8604.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8605.92s)]
*  And the fans are great. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8606.08s)]
*  Well, they just love the fact that it's here. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8607.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8609.52s)]
*  It's like, you know, out of the pandemic, this thing sprung. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8609.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8614.08s)]
*  And it really is like a weird thing that happened where we're all like, fuck this. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8614.24s)]
*  We got to get the fuck out of L.A. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8617.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8619.119999999999s)]
*  And I was particularly motivated because my children were at the time 10 and 12. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8619.480000000001s)]
*  I was like, I don't think I want them growing up in L.A. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8624.480000000001s)]
*  Like I already dodged that bullet. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8626.36s)]
*  A lot of people say that. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8627.4s)]
*  It's just creepy. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8628.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8629.720000000001s)]
*  It's like there's so much chaos and freaks and just like, you're going to get out of here. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8630.04s)]
*  You know, and then during the pandemic, we had this opportunity to move to Austin. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8635.6s)]
*  And I was like, I want to do this. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8638.92s)]
*  And it was a crazy time to do it because I was in the middle of this big Spotify deal. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8640.76s)]
*  And, you know, the whole world was shut down and I have everything running smoothly. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8645.84s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck it. Let's uproot. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8648.8s)]
*  We're going to start from scratch. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8650.48s)]
*  And we came here and I've never been happier. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8651.759999999998s)]
*  That's great. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8655.039999999999s)]
*  And then when all the other comics started coming here, too, I was like, all right, I think this is going to work. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8655.599999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of comics here. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8660.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty awesome. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8661.4s)]
*  That's so crazy that everyone's coming here. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8663.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8665.48s)]
*  It's like becoming a real hub for comedy. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8665.84s)]
*  It's so fun. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8667.759999999998s)]
*  It is fun. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8668.56s)]
*  Well, that is one of the cool things you can do with money. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8669.32s)]
*  You know, if you have money and there's something you really love, like I love stand up, you could actually do something like that. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8672.119999999999s)]
*  You can actually make something happen. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8676.84s)]
*  And make it good for a lot of people. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8678.640000000001s)]
*  It's not just good for me. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8681.52s)]
*  It's good for so many comics. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8682.400000000001s)]

*  It's good for the people that work there. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8685.68s)]
*  It's fun. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8686.84s)]
*  I mean, it helps the economy. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8687.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxfYndaXlIA&t=8689.720000000001s)]
