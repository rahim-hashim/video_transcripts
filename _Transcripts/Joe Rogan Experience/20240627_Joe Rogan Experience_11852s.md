*  There's like two banh mi places, a halo halo place. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=106.0s)]
*  Like, if you're listening, I've done the reconnaissance. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=109.0s)]
*  I was on my bike. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=112.0s)]
*  I went down Congress. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=113.0s)]

*  It was the best. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=118.0s)]
*  I had explosions in the sky playing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=120.0s)]
*  I watched Friday Night Lights when I got back to my room. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=123.0s)]
*  It's like this place is... [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=125.0s)]

*  Barbecue's great. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=131.0s)]
*  That was my concern. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=133.0s)]
*  I think the last time I did your show, it was the week you were about to leave. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=135.0s)]

*  Yeah, so I'm... [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=166.0s)]
*  Look, when people tell me how awesome Austin is, I don't know the rest of Texas, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=169.0s)]
*  but Austin is like the vibe of yesterday. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=175.0s)]
*  It's like the weather, like everyone was out having picnics. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=179.0s)]
*  How many days are you in town for? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=183.0s)]

*  It's just like... [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=214.0s)]
*  There's not a ton of Asians. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=217.0s)]
*  There's Asian communities. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=220.0s)]
*  There is, there is, but I'm saying to the Asians listening, it's a good place. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=223.0s)]

*  Yeah, I felt like the way the government has run there, they're they're just drinking the same poison that got them sick and they're not going to change. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=387.0s)]
*  And after all that defund the police shit and the chaos of shutting all the restaurants and bars and everything down from covid for like a fucking year and a half. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=394.0s)]
*  I was like, you people are incompetent and you're not going to ruin my life. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=404.0s)]
*  I'm going to go someplace where you're more free. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=410.0s)]
*  And this was the first place that we went in May of 2020. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=412.0s)]
*  And my kids loved it. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=416.0s)]
*  And my my wife loved it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=418.0s)]
*  I was like, let's go. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=419.0s)]
*  Let's fucking move. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=420.0s)]
*  So a couple months later, I was here. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=422.0s)]
*  And you don't you don't seem to come back that often. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=424.0s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=427.0s)]
*  I don't like going back. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=428.0s)]
*  It feels it feels shitty when I'm landing. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=429.0s)]
*  Too many people, man. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=432.0s)]
*  I think when you get too many people in an area, you devalue people. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=434.0s)]
*  You don't appreciate them as much. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=437.0s)]
*  They become a hindrance. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=439.0s)]
*  I have a I live in a pretty nice neighborhood in L.A. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=440.0s)]
*  I have a bat, a baseball bat. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=444.0s)]
*  I'm not an athletic person. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=446.0s)]
*  I have a baseball bat in my house that's never hit a baseball. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=447.0s)]
*  It's only hit human flesh. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=449.0s)]
*  Like it's like it's like insane. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=451.0s)]
*  If I like forget to close my garage one night, there's junkies in there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=454.0s)]
*  And I'm just like maybe Austin is a nice starter place, but I'm trying to I'm trying to like get out, get out. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=457.0s)]
*  Like I'm looking in South America. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=466.0s)]
*  I'm looking in Asia. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=468.0s)]

*  Like so I mean Costa Rica, Costa Rica for sure. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=474.0s)]
*  Like yeah, because I just you're right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=477.0s)]
*  That whole thing about things being too populated. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=481.0s)]
*  Oh, and I have to like before we like get into it, like I have to like you came on my podcast like 15 years or something. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=485.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=495.0s)]
*  Something crazy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=496.0s)]
*  Something like way in the early, early pod days. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=497.0s)]
*  And it was like so and I've done your podcast a few times now. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=499.0s)]
*  So it's like I remember when it was live and I would leave your studio and as soon as I left, people would be like, yo, that was great. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=504.0s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, dude. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=510.0s)]
*  So I always knew you had impact. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=512.0s)]
*  But to come on your show, the last time I came on like two, three years ago, it's like standing on a soapbox with a microphone in front of the whole world. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=513.0s)]
*  Like in three years, like not a day has gone by where someone doesn't say something nice or say, hey, man, like I was going to kill myself. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=522.0s)]
*  And I heard that episode and it's like you changed my life. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=530.0s)]
*  And I'm like, OK, thank you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=532.0s)]
*  It feels weird, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=534.0s)]
*  This word. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=535.0s)]
*  But in the way I mean, Jamie, you could talk about it with like we do. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=536.0s)]
*  You do the show and then you chop it up into like clips, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=542.0s)]
*  There's people out there that chop it into like tick tocks and reels. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=545.0s)]
*  And there's one where I talk about the Hadza tribe, the hunter gatherer tribe that has 30 million views. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=549.0s)]
*  And I don't know what that monetizes into for like YouTube or whatever. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=554.0s)]
*  But I think it's like it's like 50, 60 grand. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=557.0s)]
*  So it's like the words are the like you can like just this is it. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=560.0s)]
*  Like someone could get rich just like talking and doing this shit. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=565.0s)]
*  And so after after doing that show and I'm just telling like my journey to Africa and how I felt being with this hunter gatherer tribe, it like literally saved their lives. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=569.0s)]
*  Like like the money that came in, the amount of people that donated to the Hadza, the Malekka Foundation, the you know, the foundation. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=583.0s)]
*  People are calling me saying what's happening right now. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=592.0s)]
*  So and like this is like clean water for them. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=595.0s)]
*  This is like, you know, education, clothes, like all these things. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=598.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wow, you talk about something on Joe Rogan and could like save a culture, you know. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=602.0s)]
*  And and there was so much like the influencers that went out there, the guy with the red headband that eats all the crazy shit went out there. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=608.0s)]
*  The liver king out there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=616.0s)]
*  Logan Paul, I've never met the guy, calls me like, bro, take me to Tanzania. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=618.0s)]
*  Like so there's like insane like and if you guys are doing that, like please have her money, much money you're making from getting those views like all those views have like all those videos have like millions of views. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=621.0s)]
*  Please donate back to the Hadza because like they need it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=632.0s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, the Rasuli, Shawnee, the guys that I know out there are like the tourism is is is great. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=635.0s)]
*  So it's like a thriving thing just because I talked about it and and like going off what you said, like I helped make a film. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=643.0s)]
*  I was the cameraman on this film called We Are Hadza. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=653.0s)]
*  If anyone out there wants it, I just helped make it. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=656.0s)]
*  It's just like the best documentary. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=659.0s)]
*  It's like the first beginning to end baboon hunt and then skinning it, eating it. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=661.0s)]
*  But you feel like you're living that lifestyle. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=666.0s)]
*  So I'm not trying to be like Harrison Ford in like Mosquito Coast, but like I think Austin is a good buffer for the family. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=669.0s)]
*  And then eventually I do want to fully go to kind of like I'm not who am I kidding? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=679.0s)]
*  Like not fully hunter gather, but like fully like a culture where it's like not that many people. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=688.0s)]
*  I know who all my neighbors are. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=695.0s)]
*  I'm living like half like city life and half like there. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=697.0s)]
*  So things are starting to steer towards going back to Africa for me. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=701.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not even close yet. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=706.0s)]
*  I'm just saying like I remember what was it about that spoke to you so much that you want to be there more often? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=707.0s)]
*  Well, like art, I'm an artist, right? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=716.0s)]
*  And art is about expression and creating. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=718.0s)]
*  But if you're saying I'm a professional artist, at some point there has to be a conversation about business monetization, making money. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=721.0s)]
*  And, you know, we could get into all the AI shit, which is crazy. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=728.0s)]
*  But, you know, I go I go to Africa with the ego of like I'm an important artist, you know, like, and I'm going to like so I my backpack is mostly art supplies. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=731.0s)]
*  Right. And I get there and there's a cave that we're living in for like a few weeks and like, you know, if the weather's nice, we sit. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=742.0s)]
*  Sleep on top of the cave. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=750.0s)]
*  And if it's, you know, really raining or something, we sleep under the cave. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=751.0s)]
*  And in the daytime when like the real men are like hunting, I'm like, I'll give art lessons to the kids, you know. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=754.0s)]
*  And because the kids have no art training, they're just raw. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=760.0s)]
*  You know, they're just and it's just what they say. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=763.0s)]
*  Here's a bow and arrow and they're just drawing like and the drawings are like amazing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=765.0s)]
*  And I'm drawing in my mind. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=769.0s)]
*  I'm like, these are going to be like museum pieces or like I'm going to archive them when I get home and put out a book and like donate all the money back to them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=771.0s)]
*  And so we spend the whole day drawing and I'm like, these are like some of the best pieces of art because it was fun. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=779.0s)]
*  It was like in nature. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=786.0s)]
*  It's with these guys that are not trained, you know, and it's and I'm looking at it and I'm like holding it like this not to like, you know, smudge it or anything. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=788.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=796.0s)]
*  And then the tribe comes back. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=797.0s)]
*  They're covered in blood. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=799.0s)]
*  They, you know, they got an animal and I'm like, look at this art we made. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=800.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=803.0s)]
*  And we're on top of the cave. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=804.0s)]
*  And they're like, cool. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=805.0s)]
*  And they throw it off the cave. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=806.0s)]
*  And I go, wait, wait, wait, what are you doing with that? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=807.0s)]
*  I could have and I go, oh, yeah, like they don't have anything. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=810.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't like what do they have a flat file up there? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=814.0s)]
*  Like and I was like, like it just hit me so hard in that moment. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=817.0s)]

*  It's not about like, oh, I'm I'm living in the moment. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=825.0s)]
*  And then I got to like go home and edit it and like, you know, it's just like we did it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=829.0s)]
*  We love it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=833.0s)]
*  And bye bye. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=834.0s)]
*  It's a piece of paper in the wind. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=835.0s)]
*  And I was like, you know, and there was one that I drew like, you know, and I had a sketch and I was like spending a lot of time. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=836.0s)]
*  I'm going to try to. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=844.0s)]
*  And I threw it off the cliff and I was like, more of this, like more of this, like I want this thing where you just live and it is what it is and less like anxiety, stress. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=846.0s)]
*  How am I going to make money off this? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=860.0s)]
*  And and it's just they're so happy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=862.0s)]
*  And look, I spent a lot a lot of time with them and I go back as much as I can. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=865.0s)]
*  So, yeah, to to to see them like, you know, all the YouTubers that went out there and I'm like, oh, there's there's a Shawnee and Nona and Gunkida. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=870.0s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck, they're like so many celebrities now. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=881.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, like I feel like every time I go back to Africa, whether it's like Congo or Tanzania, which are like two completely different, you know, I remember when I went to the Congo the first time I was 1918, 1995. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=885.0s)]
*  That was when you filmed that thing for Vice when you're looking for. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=901.0s)]
*  No, that was when I was in the movie. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=903.0s)]
*  I remember when I went to the Congo the first time I was 1918, 1995. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=905.0s)]
*  That was when you filmed that thing for Vice when you're looking for. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=911.0s)]
*  No, the first time I went is when I went to look for the dinosaur by myself and then Vice saw that I wrote an article about that and they sent me back like 10 years later when I was 20, 25 or something. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=913.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=926.0s)]
*  But I remember finding a missionary deep, deep, deep in the jungle. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=927.0s)]
*  And he's like, bro, you think you're the first one? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=931.0s)]
*  I was like, what do you mean? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=934.0s)]
*  He's like, you think you're the first like lost soul that's come here looking for dinosaurs? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=936.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm like, I'm not. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=941.0s)]
*  He's like, he's like, I've been here for 20 years, like living with these people, like every five years, a weirdo like you comes through. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=943.0s)]
*  And do you think you're really looking for the dinosaur? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=952.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'm looking for a dinosaur. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=954.0s)]
*  He's like, no, you're looking for something else. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=956.0s)]
*  You're either running from something else or you're looking for some kind of meaning in your life that you can't find. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=958.0s)]
*  So this is you've pushed yourself to to this, you know, and I'm like, fuck, dude, trying to get deep with me, bro. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=963.0s)]
*  So so, yeah, I mean, I go back to Africa and like. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=971.0s)]
*  It's hard for me to talk about this stuff without like sounding cringe or. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=978.0s)]
*  People. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=984.0s)]
*  I don't know, it's like, let's look at life as a video game, right? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=987.0s)]
*  Like as someone who is like heavily, heavily addicted to video games and like born into a super, super Christian kind of background, right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=992.0s)]
*  Like. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1002.0s)]
*  If you are in any kind of like strict religion, organized religion, growing up Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, whatever, it's kind of like being born into a video game because it's like it's very binary, right? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1004.0s)]
*  There's heaven and hell, especially if it's Christian. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1016.0s)]
*  And so you have to live a certain way. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1018.0s)]
*  You got to get a certain amount of points to have everlasting love, you know, peace, joy. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1020.0s)]
*  And then if you don't want more like, yeah, you're fucked. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1025.0s)]
*  And you're OK for how long? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1029.0s)]
*  How much before I can respond like forever? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1030.0s)]
*  And you're like, wait, that's a long that's a long time, you know, and I'm like, fuck, man. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1032.0s)]
*  And so I don't I don't subscribe to any organized religion. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1039.0s)]
*  I consider myself a spiritual person, but. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1044.0s)]
*  But. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1046.0s)]
*  Like without making light or trying to be disrespectful, like if the things that I tried to figure out, like a like a game, like a video game was sex, money, power, right? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1048.0s)]
*  Like as an artist. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1061.0s)]
*  I had subscribed to the starving artist like type, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1063.0s)]
*  I was like top ramen, you know, holes in your clothes, like like homeless. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1069.0s)]
*  Like I was like, that is what a real artist is until I met a successful artist until I I was like, oh, shit, like you can have a manager and an agent and an office and like you can like not starve. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1075.0s)]
*  And and I remember at that point, I was in my early 20s. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1086.0s)]
*  I was like, man, people sure like talk about money a lot, right? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1091.0s)]
*  Like it seems to be like this thing that causes a lot of problems in marriages and business. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1095.0s)]
*  And I go. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1098.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem that hard to me as something I'm saying this as a guy in my 20s. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1100.0s)]
*  That's poor. I'm like, what if I just like try to be as rich as possible for the next 10 years or five years? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1105.0s)]
*  Like, what if that's my singular focus? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1112.0s)]
*  And so. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1114.0s)]
*  I did it and it was a lot of work, but like the video game for of money is over for me now. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1116.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1121.0s)]
*  Like I like every industry gambling, the stock market, like even like people go, oh, that's like this Korean force company. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1122.0s)]
*  He just he was like this like this homeless guy that like that got lucky with Facebook. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1131.0s)]
*  I'm like, that was like a lot of work to make that happen, you know. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1137.0s)]
*  And I was already kind of wealthy when I when I made that deal. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1142.0s)]
*  But people like to tell that story. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1145.0s)]
*  So I made millions of dollars gambling. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1147.0s)]
*  I made millions of dollars with my art. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1150.0s)]
*  I made millions of dollars with Facebook. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1151.0s)]
*  And. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1153.0s)]
*  It was a lot of hard work, but I'm like. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1156.0s)]
*  It's kind of if I wanted to. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1159.0s)]
*  You tell me how cringe I sound and I'll just stop. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1163.0s)]
*  But I'm like, it's not going to be that hard for me to become a billionaire at a certain level. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1166.0s)]
*  Right. Like I've amassed hundreds of millions. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1170.0s)]
*  I'm like, if that's my goal now, if that's my video game. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1172.0s)]
*  And then I know billionaires. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1175.0s)]

*  Right. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1194.0s)]
*  The problem with money is people become obsessed with it because it's so difficult to attain. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1195.0s)]
*  And there's so much societal value. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1199.0s)]

*  geniuses and they spent everything is down to a fraction and they they just [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1282.0s)]
*  grind and crunch numbers in their brain. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1286.0s)]
*  And that's not how I think. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1287.0s)]
*  I think very abstract. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1288.0s)]
*  I think and I go, I'm going to do stuff that on paper makes absolutely no sense. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1289.0s)]
*  And I promise you, I will change the planet with that money. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1294.0s)]
*  Like I'm going to do shit that and then he was like he was he didn't say no, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1297.0s)]
*  but he was thinking it over and he's like, dude, there's like there's no way [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1301.0s)]
*  like my money guys are going to do this. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1304.0s)]
*  And then I sat there and I thought about it because money is power. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1305.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, I don't want a billion dollars. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1308.0s)]
*  I don't want that responsibility. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1310.0s)]
*  And ultimately he was like, no. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1312.0s)]
*  And I was like, thank you. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1313.0s)]
*  So just a wild thought. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1315.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1316.0s)]
*  Spontaneous. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1317.0s)]
*  If he had given it to me, he would have he would have fucked. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1318.0s)]
*  I would have been like those weird people. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1320.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to touch that. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1321.0s)]
*  I don't want to touch that tried it out for a while. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1323.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1325.0s)]
*  I tried it out for a while and then you would have gone back to being you. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1326.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1329.0s)]

*  where I actually sold stuff for money and and I didn't feel good. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1344.0s)]
*  It was like the my galler Steve Lazaridis is like Banksy's Banksy's guy and he's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1348.0s)]
*  like, Joe, like you're on fire. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1355.0s)]

*  It has to be in L.A. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1360.0s)]
*  It has to be on Rodeo Drive. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1361.0s)]
*  Like it has to be on the most expensive street in the world. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1363.0s)]
*  And I want like every celebrity there and like you know and so it did it happen. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1367.0s)]
*  It was like it was a show in Beverly Hills. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1373.0s)]
*  All the celebrities came all the fancy people came. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1376.0s)]
*  I sold all the art and the next day I didn't feel any different. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1378.0s)]
*  And then at that point the artist gets objectified to like just I got a Basquiat. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1382.0s)]
*  I got a show. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1388.0s)]
*  I got a Banksy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1389.0s)]
*  And I'm like I'm like the guy that's buying my art that can afford it. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1390.0s)]
*  He doesn't care about the art. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1393.0s)]
*  He just wants to like it's a dick contest right. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1394.0s)]
*  He just wants to show off like hey I got a show. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1397.0s)]
*  And I'm like I'm pretty sure that's not what the universe wants for me to like just make expensive stuff. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1399.0s)]
*  So at that point I told my manager and everyone I work with I'm like everything now is free like painting with kids painting with guys just out of jail painting with at risk youth murals museum anything where it's free. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1406.0s)]
*  That's what I'm about. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1420.0s)]
*  I'm not you know or if I like like someone I'll just trade or give it to them but I'm not selling shit anymore. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1421.0s)]
*  So that kind of like ended like you know and then I had finance guys and everything about wealth management is about how to preserve wealth and make more money. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1428.0s)]
*  And I go let's do like a Monte Carlo simulation and figure out when I'm going to die by my lifestyle of how I live and let's get it down so that I have zero by the time I'm done. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1438.0s)]
*  Like I want to and they're like so every business decision I've made since I've made that decision is I just lose money. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1448.0s)]
*  I just lose money. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1457.0s)]
*  And then the video game of sex which I wasn't very good at is age 0 to 30. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1458.0s)]
*  I'd been with five six maybe seven girls like and they were all like long term kind of relationships. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1466.0s)]
*  There was no like one night stands and then at that point like 29 30 I was like I'm really not good at this. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1474.0s)]
*  Like I don't got any game. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1482.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1484.0s)]
*  And like the same way if you saw me in my 20s as like a street urchin like street kid and he's like I'm going to be the richest artist in the world. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1485.0s)]
*  You'd be like you know what the odds of that happening are. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1497.0s)]
*  Like it's it's ridiculous in the same way and like not to sound vulgar or you know objectify women. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1500.0s)]
*  But that's what I did at that age. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1507.0s)]
*  I was young and I was like I'm tired of the Asians are like sexless small dick. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1508.0s)]
*  You know the the math nerd like I want to fuck the most amount of women as possible. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1516.0s)]
*  And that was even more ridiculous than me saying I want to be the richest artist. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1521.0s)]
*  And then and then I just went on a tear for a decade. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1525.0s)]
*  Right. Like I just it was awkward at first and then like a video game at the end a combination of like like a comedian working out their material. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1528.0s)]
*  Right. And with the oncoming social media and all the you know Internet stuff I could figure out on the dates I've been on which material killed like what what did I say to make what girl laugh. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1539.0s)]
*  And you know and and I would have all those like a crazy person like in my notes folders and I could say the perfect combination of words to make a girl laugh or like so using everything at my disposal anything like money you know fun and charm like jokes power like I'll get you on this thing or like just queuing in on what is it that you want. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1553.0s)]
*  And I can get you that. And you know I was sleeping with multiple women a day and I was like this like you would never believe. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1578.0s)]
*  I OK not you. I would never believe what I was doing like I was every night tens tens tens like Victoria's Secret models a list celebrities just like I was like whoa whoa whoa. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1589.0s)]
*  And you know I got to a point where I was like I wasn't my friends and I debate of they're like you're you were like a week away from sucking dick and I was like I was like it's probably like more like two days away because it just gets there right. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1601.0s)]
*  Like I was just like in rooms like having threesomes group sex and I was like I'm an artist I should you know and my parents are convinced I was like I was in a car going to an art show with my parents in Mexico City and my mom. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1617.0s)]
*  You know she's like completely invested in my career and she's like hey you know Andy Warhol used to do like 10 20 push ups and then his mom would give him like a snicker bar. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1634.0s)]
*  I was like that's an interesting fact mom I didn't know that and he was gay and I was like oh OK cool you know Leonardo da Vinci when he used to go out like he would know one would know he's an artist he wouldn't have like a speck of paint on him and I was like oh I didn't know that mom and he was gay. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1644.0s)]
*  And I was like what was this going and then my dad's in the front driving he's like he's not gay I told you he's not gay and my mom's like you know we're Christian and you know but we know that you're an artist and we know you haven't brought a woman home in like 10 years. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1658.0s)]
*  So just it's OK you could come out of the closet and I was like and I was like I like I love being gay so much like I I'm not like I just I almost wish I was right like I when I play like Dungeons and Dragons or a role playing game or RPG like video game or anytime I act or do anything that's like online or like a game. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1674.0s)]
*  I always want to be a gay guy like I just love it I love that feeling I want to play gay guys if you know and but I just don't love dick I want to I want to love it but I just why do you want to I just like part of it is like my shame makes me shameless and like I like it when it hurts kind of thing like I just I got close where there was a transsexual woman I think her name was like her penis was right here and I was like it's right there I should just like. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1700.0s)]
*  At least lick it or touch it at least just to say I tried it and I could say I didn't like it or I did like it but I just couldn't I was like I was so bored not of just pussy or women or whatever I just was bored of the endeavor of that and then and then you know you meet people and everyone has their game like Hollywood people like I get that Emmy or that Oscar or you know and so. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1730.0s)]
*  I like pick the game I want to play money pow and then it's like I sit here and the thing that I learned the number one important lesson from gambling is get out while your head is like I love how much money I have right now like it's the perfect amount I love that. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1755.0s)]
*  Like I have no regrets like I've had sex with so many different women that like I'm just I don't need that anymore I'm so I could be a monk for the rest of my life if I want to you know like and so there's only one final. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1771.0s)]
*  Quest and that's the spiritual quest right and that's where like people say shit like the answer is love and it's like it is right like like. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1786.0s)]
*  Like there will be shit there's shit that we talked about before we start recording that we can't and then there will be shit that we talk about later and and we live in this world now where it's like it's a crazy world right and the answer is love and everyone says it and it's in movies and it's in books but it's what does that path look like and so. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1795.0s)]
*  I go towards where I feel that and I feel that in Africa when I go to Africa I feel that like in my soul to my bones and you know I look like this in Austin and no one judges me like you would think going to Africa the places I go where there's no Asians that they would say shit but they don't they just accept me they call me brother they take me in they show me their lives and they're like you're just part of our tribe now and I'm like it makes me want to cry you know so. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1818.0s)]
*  And the fact that you know I have this beautiful relationship with you and you know you let me talk about this stuff and then those words get to you know like I don't know Logan Paul that guy calls me up right after show he's like take me to Africa bro take me I'm like okay you know like and and it's just it's just a tremendous thing and then you know we made this film and it's you know it's it's like the best documentary I've ever seen so if anyone has a question for me I'll be happy to answer it. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1846.0s)]
*  So if anyone like wants to see a trailer or we are Hadza the Malekka Foundation. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1876.0s)]
*  Is it available the whole thing. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Like. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1886.0s)]
*  Here's my it's done like it's done it's like I'll send you a link if you want to watch it like it's amazing. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1889.0s)]
*  But I'm. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1894.0s)]
*  It's like last last time I came on here I had made a TV show like I do everything backwards right like. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1898.0s)]
*  Like some some like the normal way to get a show on this I definitely want to ask you about this the normal way you get a show on TV is you pitch it right you come up with an idea but like. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1905.0s)]
*  Things don't cost that much anymore I mean I'm speaking from a rich guy so I know what that sounds like but compared to what it used to cost right like you don't if you have a nice camera and you got a good editing thing like. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1918.0s)]
*  Much cheaper like the movie that just won the Oscar everything everywhere all at once is like my favorite movie had like six guys doing the special effects and then you have you know Top Gun and I'll Top Gun but like all these other movies that have like when you see the credits at the end it's like thousands of like Korean names. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1929.0s)]
*  You're like so you can do things relatively cheaply compared right so I made the show on FX called the Cho show and I made it exactly the way I want and and you know like some you know whatever something got cut there was some notes. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1946.0s)]
*  And that's where I get stuck a lot of times right because no one tells me what to do when I paint I could do whatever the fuck I want but when it comes to media there's a bigger audience people are more sensitive people can get triggered this and that so a lot of decisions made in Hollywood are fear based decisions and I don't live my life that way. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1966.0s)]
*  Yeah well they're platform based decisions right so the problem is you're an artist but the people that distribute the stuff are not artists right there are executives and money people right and all those money people they look at you and they go well David Cho is very popular he's very eccentric. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=1989.0s)]
*  This might work we might be able to make money and then they start thinking about new cars they're gonna buy new houses they're gonna buy they don't think about it the way you think about it so the problem with being in business with people like that is business that's the problem. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2004.0s)]
*  Right you just try and create something cool. Yeah you're like because there is really like Atlanta is a great show Rami is a great show there's great shows but but then you're like at the end they're still trying to sell refrigerators with the advertising right yeah. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2017.0s)]
*  But not always I mean generally that's the case but there's a lot of people that create those shows that aren't trying to do that and then someone else is pitching it to the network and someone smart enough to leave that fucking guy alone right and a lot of times it's just because something is just so successful like South Park for instance. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2030.0s)]
*  Right Comedy Central 100% would fuck South Park up if they brought it to them right now they'd be like what are you gonna do right you hold on you're gonna shove Paris Hilton up a gay teacher's ass on TV no right no you can't do that right what are you gonna do you're gonna draw Mohammed right you're gonna have Mohammed dressed as a teddy bear inside of a Brinks truck right no no you can't do that but they're so big and they've been around for so long they can get away with it even in one of the most restrictive ways that they can do it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2048.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2078.0s)]
*  So they've become big enough so they can do that so it's it has to be someone you know whoever it is where they just leave you the fuck alone and that's very very rare but we just want to distribute something on YouTube you can kind of do whatever the fuck you want I mean make something pretty incredible. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2079.0s)]
*  It's it's I just helped like produce and like I was the cameraman so it's not my film but I'm like it I'm gonna have to talk to you about this because it's like I want people to see it because it's all the proceeds we're gonna donate back to the to the Hadza but it's like like Paco Rattata who's like the best you know he I met him he's in the Philippines he made the show show he's the one that edited this thing and I don't like it. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2100.0s)]
*  It's not my movie I'm just like there to help. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2130.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2133.0s)]
*  Oh there it is. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2134.0s)]
*  Hadza. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2135.0s)]
*  So the full length feature film is just oh that's just a trailer. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2136.0s)]
*  This is just a trailer I'll send you the link to it but like that's no no. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2139.0s)]
*  He's so funny. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2144.0s)]
*  You're not going to see any of the that's Hannah Sparkman the filmmaker. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2146.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2152.0s)]
*  She's. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2153.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was immediately drawn to them. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2154.0s)]
*  I'll put it I'll put it like this Joe like what is America's appetite or to see like [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2157.0s)]
*  it's not you're not going to see it in the trailer but like they catch a pregnant baboon right they rip the belly open the baby the fetus of the baboon falls out and it's second it hits the ground 10 dogs tear it to pieces. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2168.0s)]
*  Then they love the protein or what's it what's the brain made out of like. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2183.0s)]
*  But like it's that's not a nutrition that's like they know like they instinctually they know that has like fat or something. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2192.0s)]
*  So it's like the delicacy like the animal like looks human then they tear through it and like I go in a cave and it's white right the brain is like white and gray and I shine a flashlight because I hear it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2201.0s)]
*  I hear that noise and I turn the flashlight on and I see like like 10 dudes like fighting each other to like scoop as much brain and this white shit all over their face and then as they drop the skulls on the ground there's a baby playing drums on the on the baboon skull heads and I'm like this is the. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2212.0s)]
*  This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life and I don't know if this is an ex this is how people survive. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2230.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2237.0s)]
*  But I don't know if that's just too much I don't know if people I don't think it's too much it's it's real and you know that that's how those people have been surviving for a long time. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2239.0s)]
*  It's it's natural as bizarre as it seems it's natural yeah because we have a really hard time with people eating primates right now my friend Steve Rinella he filmed a show in South America and. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2250.0s)]
*  He was with this hunter gatherer tribe in South America I forget what the name. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2263.0s)]
*  You know see if you can find the name of the tribe I think they're in Guyana and they killed a monkey and ate it and he had some of the monkey and it was like it's very it's you're very conflicted it's very strange. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2268.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2282.0s)]
*  It's a primate I mean it's it's like like imagine if you were in a different world right and just imagine this and you go to a place where there's a friendly group of cannibals. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2283.0s)]
*  And they have been hunting one specific type of person maybe like pale skinned blonde people are the most delicious yeah and they just chase down these. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2295.0s)]
*  You know these kind of savage looking pale skinned blonde haired people and cook them and eat them they don't need anybody else to just see pale blonde albinos yeah like just in these people were wild looking people that weren't like leaves over their dicks and running around barefoot. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2309.0s)]
*  So you can kind of detach you know you there were your Air Force ones on like I'm not the same as them this is different. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2327.0s)]
*  You know this is but this is kind of what it's like when we're eating primates because we're eating our history. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2335.0s)]
*  Well I mean so that's what I'm saying the visuals yeah when they throw the when they throw the monkey on the fire that's how they get the fur off yeah and he's like this yeah and it looks like the crucifix on fire I'm like you and you see the skull I'm like yeah it looks human right and then there was that. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2342.0s)]
*  Was it you that said or was it Ronella that said one of the things that freaked him out was when the arrow hit him he grabbed it with his hand. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2361.0s)]
*  Oh that was I think I told you that story because it's like we feel like part of the thing is this is the only documentary I think I've never seen it on YouTube where we filmed the baboon hunt from beginning to end and it's like monkeys running fuck you like he's like that's like what he's screaming sounds like fuck you. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2366.0s)]
*  And then the dog gets his nutsack and rips it off and then you're running and you see the nutsack on the ground and you're and I'm like what is this and they're like keep that that's nutritious that's that's like the prize like the top hunter gets that I'm like all right and then you're just running and running and then like they get him and then the.

*  But there's just a thing that we have where it's closer to that than like eating a fish. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2614.0s)]
*  Like eating a fish is very far removed from us. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2619.0s)]
*  Like people don't even mind if you show photos. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2622.0s)]

*  Like it's bizarre. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2650.0s)]
*  It's really hard when you're talking about this because I don't see a way for that culture out as as humans expand. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2651.0s)]
*  Well I'm not going to pretend like I have the answer to it but what even when we go there we let them decide. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2660.0s)]
*  We're like we raise this money. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2667.0s)]

*  This is what you should be doing. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2676.0s)]
*  Like there we're sending them those kids are like we want to go to school to get educated so that we can like use words and like there's one guy named Shawnee and he's like did I tell you this last time. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2677.0s)]
*  Probably but it's OK. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2690.0s)]
*  He's like the only like some white lady took an interest in him. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2691.0s)]
*  So this is straight up crocodile Dundee like he is like he can like run up a tree and kill a squirrel with his like rip his head off and eat it. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2695.0s)]
*  But he's the only one that went to law school. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2703.0s)]
*  So he speaks Swahili, Hadzabe, English right. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2704.0s)]
*  So he can wear like a suit and tie and then still have like the Hadza headband and he's the only one that has ever as far as I know that was able to get all the proper paperwork to leave to come to the U.S. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2709.0s)]
*  So he stayed at my house when he came and I got him a shrimp. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2723.0s)]
*  I took him to like every like insane restaurant. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2727.0s)]
*  He'd never been in a swimming pool. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2730.0s)]
*  He swam in my pool for like seven hours. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2731.0s)]
*  He was like trying to drink the chlorine. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2734.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, don't drink that. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2736.0s)]
*  I took him to Fogo to Chow and he was like, leave the sword. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2738.0s)]
*  They brought out the shrimp cocktail and he was like, oh, you guys eat scorpion. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2742.0s)]
*  I'm like, bro, that's not scorpion. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2745.0s)]
*  It was like everything everywhere I took him. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2746.0s)]
*  He would eat it with his hands like at these like gourmet restaurants and he's like like grease is just going down his arm. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2750.0s)]
*  And it was like he had like the best time, but he's like, I'm so glad I went to law school. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2756.0s)]
*  So now I have the tools to go fight for my people. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2762.0s)]
*  And I don't know what the answer is. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2765.0s)]

*  Well, isn't that a lot like a neti pot? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2896.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, people do do that to clean their nose out. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2899.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2902.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2903.0s)]
*  I read about someone who had like, this might be propaganda. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2904.0s)]
*  This might be against the neti pot industry, but there was someone was using a neti pot [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2906.0s)]
*  and they got a brain, some sort of a parasite. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2911.0s)]
*  Look, there's always, there's always going to be like one, right? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2916.0s)]
*  There's always going to be. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2919.0s)]
*  We should live in fear. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2920.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2921.0s)]
*  We should just live in fear. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2922.0s)]
*  I snort salt water. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2923.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2924.0s)]

*  What is it? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2927.0s)]
*  So someone in Seattle, what did they just snort? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2928.0s)]
*  A man dies of a brain eating amoeba, possibly from rinsing his sinuses with tap water. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2931.0s)]
*  This one is in Florida. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2937.0s)]
*  Oh, that's in Florida. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2939.0s)]
*  So there's more than one. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2940.0s)]
*  You heard Steve-O's bit about this, right? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2941.0s)]
*  No, but if that shit gets in your brain from tap water, like what about when you swallow it? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2943.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2949.0s)]
*  You saw, you saw the Hadza drinking the brown water, right? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2950.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2952.0s)]
*  It's not, that water has like cow poop in it and like it's disgusting, right? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2953.0s)]
*  When I, when I met Steve-O, he's like, when his family traveled a lot when he was younger [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2958.0s)]
*  and he said, when he goes to other countries, they always tell you don't drink the water [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2963.0s)]
*  in Mexico, don't drink the, and he'd always do it. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2966.0s)]
*  And so he'd get like crazy diarrhea, get sick. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2969.0s)]
*  But now he says he has the most insane like gut biome and he never gets sick now, which [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2971.0s)]
*  like he seems like he should be dead and he isn't. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2977.0s)]
*  And so the Hadza have a very similar thing with them. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2980.0s)]
*  They have an insane micro gut biome, like the most diverse ever. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2983.0s)]
*  So by, like if I drink that shit, that brown water, I'd be dead. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2988.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be fucked. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2991.0s)]
*  You know, do you know what Joel Salatin is? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2992.0s)]
*  Joel Salatin is, he's one of those guys who's, he does these farms where all the animals [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=2995.0s)]

*  It's like, it's called regenerative agriculture. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3008.0s)]
*  So there's no pesticides, no herbicides, and it's all just about moving the animals [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3011.0s)]
*  around and having them. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3016.0s)]
*  And he drinks out of the cattle, those fucking buckets where the cows drink out, those long [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3018.0s)]
*  trough, the trough. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3024.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3025.0s)]
*  He drinks the water out of that for his own gut biome. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3026.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3029.0s)]

*  me on it shit, but I just buy all of that stuff anyways. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3037.0s)]
*  Like in the same way with the oxygenated pool, there's like, you live a life very similar [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3039.0s)]
*  to mine where sometimes we meet people and they go, hey man, if I had your money, this [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3045.0s)]

*  But like it felt lonely. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3162.0s)]
*  I'm paying a guy to be here. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3164.0s)]
*  And like the thing that I was missing in my life was accountability because there was no like I'm like I want a life where I have no accountability. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3167.0s)]
*  I want to be like a kid. I want to be Robin Hood or Peter Pan forever. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3175.0s)]
*  And so people were like, oh, if money will keep you accountable, if you're paying someone six hundred bucks an hour, like you're definitely going to show up to that appointment. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3178.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm not. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3186.0s)]
*  So I found this guy, this rogue trainer that like my friend was like, I know a guy. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3188.0s)]
*  And I was like, well, what's this guy like? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3194.0s)]

*  Yeah, he's like, you will do you will get in the shape. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3210.0s)]
*  But you have to sign this thing that says I'm allowed to come over to your house. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3213.0s)]
*  You have to give me a key to your house. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3216.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. And so like and for someone like me who likes pain, I'm like, I don't give a fuck. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3218.0s)]
*  And so I missed my first like I missed, dude, not exaggerating. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3223.0s)]

*  He runs up the stairs and my mom happened to be stopping at my house to drop off kimchi. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3228.0s)]
*  So she sees a guy, a huge guy, Russian guy run up the stairs and start pummeling my sternum. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3233.0s)]
*  And she screams like, oh, my God, I paid this guy to do this. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3240.0s)]

*  Like this is we should probably stop talking about too many people are moving here. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I don't know if they want people that look like this. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3361.0s)]
*  Of course they do. It's a it's a very it's interesting. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3363.0s)]
*  One of the things they always say about Austin is keep Austin blue and surrounded. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3367.0s)]
*  So what keeps it in check is it's surrounded by real Texas, like real country Texas. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3372.0s)]
*  But Austin, the city is very progressive, super progressive. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3379.0s)]
*  And I think it's a perfect combination because I think the two of them balance each other out and keeps everything in check. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3384.0s)]
*  Progressive people in Austin are much more reasonable than a lot of the progressive people that I met in L.A. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3390.0s)]
*  It's just a generalization for sure. It's definitely an anomaly. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3396.0s)]
*  They're Texas people. Right. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3400.0s)]
*  You know, it's like there's a there's a deeply rooted independence in this state that came from how difficult it was to settle. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3402.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like this. There's this fucking amazing book, the Comanche book. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3411.0s)]
*  What is the name of it, Jamie? Empire of the Summer Moon, Empire of the Summer Moon. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3417.0s)]
*  It's fucking insane book about the Comanche who lived here. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3422.0s)]
*  It's one of the best books I've ever read. I've read it twice. All right. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3427.0s)]
*  I'm going to check that out. It's really good, dude. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3430.0s)]
*  And it's all about the history of this state was so difficult to conquer because the Comanches were they were the best at riding horses and they were best at raising horses out of all the Native American tribes. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3432.0s)]
*  And so they had these massive stockpiles of horses and they would ride on the horses and shoot arrows before the guys could get off a second shot. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3444.0s)]
*  Because the whole thing about old school guns like muskets. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3455.0s)]
*  Exactly. They kept the arrows in their fingers and they would fire them off one at a time. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3459.0s)]
*  I can't do that. No. But they could do. Yeah, that's crazy shit. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3464.0s)]
*  But they could do. There's a dude that does it though. Lars Anderson guy. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3469.0s)]
*  Faster than shooting a gun. Yeah. Check out this guy. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3473.0s)]
*  This guy. This is this guy. We've had him on before, but he's actually bringing back these old methods that people actually forgot, mostly based on artwork. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3476.0s)]
*  Like he's looking at these artists renditions of guys with multiple arrows in their fingers. Whoa. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3485.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that was about Empire of the Summer Moon, right? All right. I got it. It's in there. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3494.0s)]
*  But when you see him do it, it's really impressive. Oh shit. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3500.0s)]
*  Watch how he can do this. Oh shit. Oh shit. Yeah. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3504.0s)]
*  So he's got them all stacked up there and he's just lining them all up one at a time. All right. I got it. I'm going to come to Austin. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3508.0s)]
*  I'm going to learn how to shoot like that. I'm going to like take. You'd have to meet that guy. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3516.0s)]
*  I don't think he's in Austin. I don't think he's American. Right. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3521.0s)]
*  Isn't he somewhere? I'll take years to learn to do this and then I'll I'll bring this skill to the Hadza. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3524.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. If they knew it. Well, if you just brought them fucking compound bows, they would be infinitely more successful. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3530.0s)]
*  But my my what I was saying before about them, though, was that if did you see that last shot? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3535.0s)]
*  He was like, yeah, no, he does crazy shit. He's like on the horse. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3542.0s)]
*  He can run and do this. It's really impressive. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3546.0s)]
*  So he's he's on a horse and his face is so monotone. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3549.0s)]
*  They think that's how the Mongols did it, too. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3554.0s)]
*  And there's even some really ancient photos of hieroglyphs in Egypt that depict arrows that are held in a similar way. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3558.0s)]
*  So they think, I mean, it makes sense. I mean, he's it's not like he's the first guy to figure this out. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3567.0s)]
*  I mean, pretty interesting shit. Austin, like, I don't know any of that history, but like it is definitely I've never been to a place like this. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3572.0s)]
*  It's like surrounded by all this like red parts of Texas. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3580.0s)]
*  It's just that's where the balance comes in. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3584.0s)]
*  It feels loving. Like the people like it like just in like the lady at the hotel and the restaurant, like everyone's super nice. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3587.0s)]
*  You're not that landlocked because you could like what's two hours away to to the to the water. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3595.0s)]
*  Right. I don't know. It's like I'm I'm feeling it. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3600.0s)]
*  You know, as long as like there's someplace where I could get kimchi. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3604.0s)]
*  I'm good. I'm sure there is. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3608.0s)]
*  Dude, I have a question for you that you're the perfect person to ask for this because people that don't know this about Joe Rogan used to be an actor. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3611.0s)]
*  Well, I've done some acting. I wasn't very good at it. I was good at sitcom acting. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3622.0s)]
*  I never did like real. I know you went you went hard like on on news radio. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3626.0s)]
*  But that's sitcom acting is not hard, man. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3630.0s)]
*  It's like the hardest shit is like Daniel Day-Lewis, Joaquin Phoenix acting. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3634.0s)]
*  That's hard acting. But like just playing a guy and saying a funny line. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3639.0s)]
*  So you don't act anymore. No, no, no, no. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3643.0s)]
*  And like there's no project that you would come back to. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3645.0s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. It's like it's like I love it. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3647.0s)]
*  It's not a negative on acting. I mean, I appreciate I love movies. You know, I love great acting. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3651.0s)]
*  I just don't like to do it. All right. It's just too many hours. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3657.0s)]
*  It takes too long. It's not what I'm interested in. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3660.0s)]
*  You know, I'm more interested in podcasts and stand up and I don't have enough time to do anything else other than UFC commentary. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3663.0s)]
*  So there's no project you can just not interested if it was like a one day shoot. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3671.0s)]
*  It's great. Wow. Yeah, it's I just there's other I don't want to play baseball either. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3676.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean I hate baseball. I'm just not interested. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3682.0s)]
*  OK, well, I don't want to do anything like just because it's a job. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3686.0s)]
*  So that's what it would. So last time I came on here, I was like or maybe in private. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3694.0s)]
*  I've always told you like a little less with the UFC stuff and maybe like try to get into painting. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3698.0s)]
*  And you're like, I'm not interested in painting unless, you know, I don't do anything halfway. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3703.0s)]
*  Like I want to go in, go in. Right. Yeah. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3707.0s)]
*  And like, I can't even remember the last time I was on Howard Stern, but it was like 15 years ago or something. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3709.0s)]
*  And at the either I said it on the show or after it ended, I was like, because I know he's interested in chess and photography and whatever. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3716.0s)]
*  I just was like, he he has like the soul of an artist. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3722.0s)]
*  And I was like, you should get into painting. And and now like it's sad for me because I feel like he should have. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3726.0s)]
*  I feel like he should have also got out while he was head like whenever his contract ended, he should have stopped. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3732.0s)]
*  He's kind of feeling to me like my dad talking at me or down to me now. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3736.0s)]
*  He does a little bit of that. But his watercolors, natural thing that happens to old men, though, Jamie, if you could find it, I'm going to be doing that. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3742.0s)]
*  Oh, definitely. I hope not, though. I want to be talking down to people soon. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3748.0s)]
*  Well, I think I think I think you'll I think you'll be more accepting of being talked down to if someone looks like this. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yes. But his watercolors, of course, his watercolors, he just like paints all the time now and they're better than most like artists. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3757.0s)]
*  I'm sure like like he just like brilliant guy. He like went into it hard, you know. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3767.0s)]
*  But that guy is responsible for all this. If it wasn't for him, if it wasn't, I mean, we got ahead of the game. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3771.0s)]
*  Yeah, because of the Howard Stern show. That's very good. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3778.0s)]
*  You know, what is recent? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3781.0s)]
*  So how long did he take to be able to paint like that? I think he just dedicated like 10 years to it, you know, and he's like and it's probably honestly probably why he's not that good at broadcasting. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3783.0s)]
*  Yeah, because he's like and you could tell like that's a really good. It's really good. Right. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3793.0s)]
*  Really good. Like perspective. I mean, I offer him art lessons. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3799.0s)]
*  Wow. After I did his show, I was like, hey, dude, if you ever want to like and he's like, I'm I'm not even close to that. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3804.0s)]
*  It's great. You might be right about that. Maybe that's like his primary focus now. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3810.0s)]
*  So I always remember. But it's probably it's also probably like that's why he doesn't go into town. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3815.0s)]
*  I mean, look at that shit, dude. He's like and those things are tiny. Those are like with those tiny brushes and it's really incredible. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3821.0s)]
*  It's really incredible. But of course, it's just like makes sense. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3828.0s)]
*  Like when I heard that he was like really in the chess, I was like, oh, of course he is. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3832.0s)]
*  That makes sense. It's like whatever led him to figure out how to be the biggest broadcaster in history, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3836.0s)]
*  that kind of energy could apply to anything. And you're seeing that if you're doing that. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3843.0s)]
*  Yeah. Then you it's like that took away from you know, you only have certain hours in the day. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3847.0s)]
*  And like that's not like a casual like he's going for it. Right. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3851.0s)]
*  Like that's like he could sell those in a gallery. Right. I wonder if that complementary though, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3855.0s)]
*  because some things I think other activities are complementary is like cross training. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3859.0s)]
*  That's that's no talking like he that that's like quiet. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3864.0s)]
*  Nobody like silent. That's meditation. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3869.0s)]
*  But my thought was I wonder if that stimulates the mind in a way that might actually make him better at talking to people [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3871.0s)]
*  because oftentimes that does happen. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3878.0s)]
*  Like when you get good at another thing like you get better at certain aspects of other things that you do there like correlated. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3880.0s)]
*  So can I tell you what happened? And I would love your feedback on it. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3888.0s)]
*  Yes. So I'm I'm kind of like I didn't realize it, but I'm kind of like that too. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3891.0s)]
*  Right. And just being born and raised in Los Angeles, people go, are you interested in making movies or or being an actor? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3895.0s)]
*  And I never really put it together. But I was like, why would I want to be an actor? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3903.0s)]
*  Like the only rules available for Asians are Kung Fu master, which I'm not I'm not that good at martial arts. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3908.0s)]
*  I am an MMA artist, mixed media artist, but not that kind of artist. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3914.0s)]
*  And I'm not you know, what is it? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3917.0s)]
*  It's either like nerd, like math geek waiter. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3920.0s)]
*  Like it's just I'd never seen an Asian guy be the lead or something. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3924.0s)]
*  So it's just like I killed the old dream for me, you know, in the same way when I give art lessons or play with like someone who's not an artist. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3928.0s)]
*  The first thing they always throw out is like, I'm not I suck. I suck. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3937.0s)]
*  And I go, why did you do that? Why did you just like do that to yourself before we even started? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3940.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's because we do that from the day that we can talk and walk. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3945.0s)]
*  Right. Well, we also do that to express humility out of respect for what you do. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3949.0s)]
*  There's like people say things like that just because they're a fan. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3953.0s)]
*  Like if you asked me if I could draw, I'd go, I could draw pretty good. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3956.0s)]
*  But I kind of suck compared to you. I would say that's like that's why they're doing it. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3960.0s)]
*  They just don't want you to think like, oh, I'm a fucking artist, too, bro. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3965.0s)]
*  You know, like they don't want to come off douchey. They're fans. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3968.0s)]
*  I hear you. And that's fair. But don't you think at a young age, if they see like a kid being strong or doing something athletic, they go, oh, he's going to be a football player. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3970.0s)]
*  And you already start getting boxed into like, like if I start drawing and stuff, they're like, oh, he's going to be an artist. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3980.0s)]
*  So in the same way, I killed my own dream because I was like, there's just nothing like if I in my own the movie in my head, I am Indiana Jones. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3986.0s)]
*  I'm the fucking Wolverine. I'm Batman. I'm all those things. But I wouldn't be I wouldn't have that role if I got it. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=3995.0s)]
*  So I just killed the dream for myself in the same way. I, you know, I grew up in a lot of different mixed neighborhoods. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4002.0s)]
*  And so my dad, who's a great athlete, he plays every sport, would take us to like the playground and there'd be all these black guys playing basketball. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4010.0s)]
*  And he, you know, he could sink it from anywhere in the court and he'd give us the ball and go, now your turn. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4019.0s)]
*  Keep in mind, I've never thrown a basketball. So it's like the second I miss, Mr. Miyagi, you know, it's like it's not a safe place to make accidents and whatever. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4024.0s)]
*  Now, at age 46, sometimes I go with my artsy friends early in the morning, like 530. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4034.0s)]
*  We all have kids now. So we go early, early in the morning before anyone's awake. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4040.0s)]
*  And because the threat of being made fun of is gone, I'm like, I'm pretty good at it. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4043.0s)]
*  I'm like, I can fucking throw a spiral. Like I can catch a, I'm like, oh, I'm holy shit. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4048.0s)]
*  And then same thing. Like when I work with people where the no one they know that they're not being watched or whatever. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4054.0s)]
*  Right. I'm like, oh shit, like you're really good at drawing, you know. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4059.0s)]
*  Yeah, that holds people back with everything that holds people back. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4062.0s)]
*  Performance anxiety holds people back in fights, holds people back with comedy, you know. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4065.0s)]
*  So I wasn't trying like I'm like you. I'm like, I'm not trying to be an actor or anything. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4071.0s)]
*  But during the every time I've been on TV, it's just either as myself or like a cartoonish exaggerated version of myself. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4075.0s)]
*  And so my ego got a little bit inflated because it was like thumbs up my hitchhiking show or me going looking for a dinosaur, you know, going on Bourdain show or Dave Chang show. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4083.0s)]
*  It's always just me. I'm not acting. Right. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4093.0s)]
*  And then because I was doing all these like kind of cooking, Dave Chang, you know him, the chef? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4095.0s)]
*  I don't know him personally. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4102.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing this show, Ugly Delicious with him on Netflix and Mariel, the producer of it, is like, do you want to be a food judge on like Top Chef? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4103.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck yeah. Like I want to go eat good stuff. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4113.0s)]
*  And it was this Jonathan Gold episode where he's the you know, he's like the best food critic in L.A. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4116.0s)]
*  that had passed away. So this was like out of respect to him. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4123.0s)]
*  And John Favreau was there and I don't and he's he has his own cooking show with Roy Troy called The Chef Show on Netflix. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4126.0s)]
*  And I had heard that he had just gotten the Star Wars gig to do The Mandalorian. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4134.0s)]
*  And I have mixed feelings about how much that I'm a grown man and I still go to the comic book shop every Wednesday and all that stuff. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4140.0s)]
*  But like I love superhero stuff like I love Batman, Spider-Man, Superman. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4149.0s)]
*  I love all that shit. I love all the Star Wars stuff. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4152.0s)]
*  Even even though most of it is all shitty now, I still love it. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4154.0s)]
*  So I told him I don't know when I'm ever going to meet this guy again. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4158.0s)]
*  So as he you know, we went to tacos in 1988 and as he got in the car and the valet pulls up, I go, hey, good. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4163.0s)]
*  You know, I didn't want to be the fanboy guy, but I was like, hey, congratulations on getting that Star Wars gig. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4169.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh, yeah, thanks, Dave. And the other guy's giving him his keys and he's about to drive off. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4173.0s)]
*  And I go, you'll put some fucking street art in Star Wars. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4177.0s)]
*  And he's like, what? And I was like, the Alliance, the Rebel Alliance, the you know, like every time in history, the Great Wall, Russia, Vietnam, it doesn't matter. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4181.0s)]
*  Anytime there's a war anywhere in the world, there's there's art, rebellious art, right? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4192.0s)]
*  There's posters, there's graffiti of saying like, fuck the system, fuck the man down with the you know, whatever. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4197.0s)]
*  I'm like, in Star Wars, you have like Nazi type characters. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4203.0s)]
*  You have all this like fighting and there's no there's no like graffiti. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4207.0s)]
*  And he goes, you're right, Dave. That's a very good point. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4212.0s)]
*  Yeah. And he goes, you're right, Dave. And you should do it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4216.0s)]
*  And I had just had my kid and stuff. And he's like, I'm like, dude, I'm not trying to look for work right now. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4218.0s)]
*  I'm just saying someone should do that. He goes, you're right. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4222.0s)]
*  And it should be you. I was like, fuck, man. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4224.0s)]
*  So I get this, you know, it was fun for me. And I went and I was like, I went hardcore nerd. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4227.0s)]
*  I was like, OK, Jawas are like this tall. So the graffiti would be like this. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4232.0s)]
*  And Luke Skywalker would not be known on this. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4236.0s)]
*  So I'm like learning the Arabesh language, the Star Wars language, and I'm layering the graffiti so it would be accurate. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4239.0s)]
*  Like I'm like going total nerd. And and he goes, all right. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4245.0s)]
*  And he tries to pay me. And I go, dude, I haven't gotten a paycheck in like 10 years. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4249.0s)]
*  Like I can't I don't want to get paid. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4253.0s)]
*  And the guy at Lucasfilm is like, you don't get paid like you're going to get paid a lot of money for this. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4255.0s)]
*  I go, I don't I don't I don't want to fill out taxes for this shit. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4260.0s)]
*  Like I don't work like I'm I'm jobless. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4263.0s)]
*  And he goes, you're the first person that's ever denied a check from Disney. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4266.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, I'm not. And then I go, put me in, coach. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4270.0s)]
*  He's like, what do you mean? I'm like, put me in. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4274.0s)]
*  Like just so I could tell my friends and shit that I was in Star Wars and and so eight hours of makeup, eight hours of fucking. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4275.0s)]
*  Look at that shit like fucking prosthetics. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4283.0s)]
*  You know, so I have like I have one second of screen time. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4286.0s)]
*  That's like a camera panning, you know, and I had to do make and then, you know, they put like paint speckles. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4293.0s)]
*  Like they made it look like I was the guy that actually did the graffiti. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4299.0s)]
*  You know, oh, so this is the first time I'm on TV acting like not as me. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4302.0s)]
*  So I go home. I write a short story about the backstory of my character. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4309.0s)]
*  And I go, oh, it's too boring for me to scream in English. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4313.0s)]
*  I'm going to learn Hattie's job of the huts language. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4316.0s)]
*  So I'm I'm out there. I got five pages of dialogue. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4318.0s)]
*  Like we're at a gambling rake. We're betting on Gamorrean guards fighting. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4321.0s)]
*  So it's like a fight scene. And it's like, fuck him up. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4325.0s)]
*  Fuck him up, Chris, like like all that. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4328.0s)]
*  And I'm saying it beats you, you do, man, I check out the pool and like everyone's like, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4330.0s)]
*  uh, dude, you're a fucking extra that's in here for one second. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4335.0s)]
*  And no one asked you to learn job of the huts language. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4340.0s)]
*  And, you know, but I didn't know how to not go hard, you know, with it. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4344.0s)]
*  And then so did they tell you to not do it? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4348.0s)]
*  They didn't. They're like, so I'm like, I'm the extra hanging out there. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4351.0s)]
*  And I go, hey, just like I know, like, you know, this is just me being me. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4355.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not trying to get more airtime or whatever. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4359.0s)]
*  But I did write a backstory of how I ended up in a game. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4363.0s)]
*  I am a gambling addict. This is how I ended up at a Gamorrean guard gambling thing. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4366.0s)]
*  And I give it to John Favreau and and Dave Filoni, who are like the showrunners. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4370.0s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, we'll get right on that day. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4374.0s)]
*  So that's hilarious. So I'm like, wow, I'm not like I went kind of all in. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4376.0s)]
*  Like I wasn't, you know. So anyways, it was enough. I'm like, that was great. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4384.0s)]
*  Then I get a call one day from Ali Wong and Steve Young at the same time. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4387.0s)]
*  They're on this new show on Netflix called Beef from A24. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4392.0s)]
*  And they say the same thing. They go, Dave, have you ever thought about acting? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4397.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm like family, dude. I'm like chilling, trying to figure out how to get to Africa. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4400.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not trying to trying to do this. And then I go, what's the part? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4405.0s)]
*  And I'm like, well, it would be filming in L.A. It'd be for like three months. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4411.0s)]
*  And you'd be playing an angry Korean guy. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4415.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, is that is that how you guys see me? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4418.0s)]
*  You know, I'm like, I'm pretty I'm like pretty chill, you know, like in my normal life. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4422.0s)]
*  Like I'll tell you all this shit later. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4427.0s)]
*  But like I kicked my parents out of the mansion. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4429.0s)]
*  I bought them because I asked them a million times not to do certain things and they didn't listen to me. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4432.0s)]
*  And I was like, I'm not like making crazy requests. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4437.0s)]
*  It's just like I've learned what a boundary is and please don't cross it. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4440.0s)]
*  And they did. So this is this is my real life. Right. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4443.0s)]
*  My real life is like my brother, my my my family. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4446.0s)]
*  Like when they fuck with me, I go, I ask you like not to do that. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4451.0s)]
*  And if you do that, then I'm going to have to remove like that's my normal life. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4455.0s)]
*  But in this TV show, fuck you. Like I'm like waving my gun out like. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4458.0s)]
*  And they're like the character's name is Isaac Cho. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4462.0s)]
*  And I'm like, that's not that far of a stretch, you know. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4465.0s)]
*  And so I go, why don't you guys hire actor like a real actor? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4468.0s)]
*  And they're like, there's all these people coming in casting and they're like playing to be like Asian gangster tough guy. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4472.0s)]
*  But you're just an asshole. And I'm like, I'm like, should I should I take an acting class? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4478.0s)]
*  Like, I don't want to like, you know, Steve Young's like Oscar nominated like Ali Wong. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4483.0s)]
*  Like they're like, no, they've just come in and be yourself. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4487.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck you guys. So I come in and I thought they were offering me the part. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4490.0s)]
*  So I come in and it's an audition and I go, I'm too fucking old for this shit. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4495.0s)]
*  Like I'm too fragile to like like they didn't make a distinction when you were having a conversation. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4499.0s)]
*  How casual was this conversation for you to come into a movie or a television show? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4506.0s)]
*  I mean, I went in and I just like I want to do a good job. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4511.0s)]
*  So I like I fully like. Like, yeah, you did know it was an audition. I didn't. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4514.0s)]
*  I thought they were so I thought they were asking me like, can you do this? [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4520.0s)]
*  And I was like, all right, fuck it. You know, so I went in and I'm like sitting next to the 10 other guys that are actual actors. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4523.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, I'm not going to get this part, you know. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4528.0s)]
*  And then I do my part and I'm like waiting by the phone like I hope I hope validate me. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4530.0s)]
*  I hope you like me. And then they call me and they're like, you got the part. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4536.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, shit. Like I kind of like didn't want to get it in the same way. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4540.0s)]
*  Like, do you ever watch Survivor? Yes. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4546.0s)]
*  So a lot of young a lot of people don't even know it's still on there, but it's been on there for like 30 years. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4549.0s)]
*  It's crazy how long it's been on. And yeah. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4554.0s)]
*  And then they asked me to be on a survivor offshoot called Take It to the Edge or Beyond the Edge. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4557.0s)]
*  And it's like all washed up. So I sound mean right now. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4565.0s)]
*  It was like it was like a 70 year old ex supermodel and like, OK, retired NFL players. Right. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4568.0s)]
*  And I was the last one. So I'm like, what? Like, Steve said no. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4575.0s)]
*  I called Steve. I was like, did they hit you up? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4578.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I said no. And I was like, I love Survivor. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4580.0s)]
*  This ain't it. But I should do this. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4584.0s)]
*  And and they were like, please just. And it was during the pandemic. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4586.0s)]
*  It was like you compete with other celebrities. And the thing with this is there's no losers. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4590.0s)]
*  Everyone wins and we donate all the money to charity. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4594.0s)]
*  And I was like and I was like, that is the fattest I'd ever been. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4596.0s)]
*  I ate so much Postmates during the thing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4599.0s)]
*  And my trainer or my manager was like, dude, you got to if you're going to do this, I say don't do it. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4601.0s)]
*  But if you're going to do it, like you're going to be with all these like washed up people like you have to win. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4606.0s)]
*  So then so then that's when I hired the hitting guy. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4611.0s)]
*  That's so I did actually get into pretty good shape. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4614.0s)]
*  And then ultimately at the end, I said no. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4618.0s)]
*  And then at a party, I met Jeff Probst and I said, hey, dude, I almost did this show. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4621.0s)]
*  And he's like, oh, I'm actually not a part of that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4625.0s)]
*  But why don't you do the actual survivor? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4627.0s)]
*  I was like, dude, I'm fucking super rich. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4629.0s)]
*  No one's going to let me win. Like get all the way to then he's like we had Mike White. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4631.0s)]
*  We had another guy that got like to the end. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4635.0s)]
*  And I was like, all it would take is one of those people to recognize who I am. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4638.0s)]
*  And then like they're going to like vote me out immediately. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4641.0s)]
*  He's like, dude, we think you have like the right thing. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4643.0s)]
*  So I got like I got into like the best shape. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4646.0s)]
*  And, you know, obviously nice having Jeff bad for me. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4650.0s)]
*  But I mean, that interview process was insane. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4656.0s)]
*  They have like therapists talking. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4659.0s)]
*  They want to make sure that you're not going to hurt someone or kill yourself on that island. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4662.0s)]
*  Right. So it was like law. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4665.0s)]
*  And they got to the very end. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4668.0s)]
*  And then at the very end, they're like, can you do that thing that like you remember when Chris Rock paid like a million dollars to like delete him throwing the shit? [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4669.0s)]
*  I'm probably fucking him up right now. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4677.0s)]
*  But you remember he threw like one of the worst first. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4678.0s)]
*  What do you call it? A pitch pitch. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4681.0s)]
*  He threw one of the worst ones. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4683.0s)]
*  And then now you can't find it anywhere. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4684.0s)]

*  So the fact that I could have been on Survivor was enough for me. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4873.68s)]
*  And I didn't want to be away from my family for that long anyways. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4877.88s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't imagine what I do on those shows. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4881.0s)]
*  I just love the any show that's competitive that pushes you to your. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4883.76s)]
*  I'm sure it's fun. You know, I'm sure it's fun. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4887.8s)]

*  Yeah. Well, I mean, if I get voted off right away, it's like fine. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4892.12s)]
*  But if you're all the way to the end, that's 90 days. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4894.76s)]
*  I could see someone like you wanting to do it just for the experience, though. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4897.4s)]
*  I mean, that's just because it's a wild, crazy thing to do. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4901.599999999999s)]
*  Right. And that's what that's why I would have done it, because I've been a survivor fan my whole life. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4903.92s)]
*  And, you know, that show is that the longest running reality game show? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4907.76s)]

*  I wonder what's longer. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4930.84s)]
*  There's a longer one. 43 seasons and 23 years. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4932.08s)]
*  I mean, I would have killed that fear factor. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4935.68s)]

*  Physical stuff would have been hard for me. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4944.2s)]
*  It's hard for everybody because it's like some of your factor, just the food. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4945.84s)]
*  I would have killed like like we had one where they had to hang onto a bar over like a lake. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4950.12s)]
*  Yeah. So they're hanging underneath this bridge. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4958.68s)]

*  A lot of women. Wow. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4965.12s)]

*  Emotionally or physically. But probably both. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4969.28s)]
*  But they hang on to like really shitty relationships. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4971.76s)]
*  They don't have all the weight. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4974.16s)]
*  Yeah. If you're carrying 200 pounds, but she's only carrying 120 pounds, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4976.24s)]
*  that 80 pounds makes a big difference with your hands. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4980.88s)]
*  I would have I would have lost on that part and then one on the baboon dick part. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4984.0s)]
*  So I said no to Survivor Beyond Beyond the Edge, whatever that show was called. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4990.32s)]
*  And and now I was in like pretty good shape because of the abusive Russian trainer I had. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=4996.24s)]

*  There could be between Japanese and Koreans. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5087.84s)]
*  And my dad set me up on a full, like, Japanese judo dojo in Sautele in Los Angeles. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5090.08s)]
*  And they did not take it easy on me. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5096.68s)]
*  And it's like, I'm kind of like, I think a lot of people are like this, like, with whatever profession they're in. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5098.92s)]
*  They learn one move really good and then they milk the shit out of it. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5104.04s)]

*  From tripping people? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5122.84s)]

*  And I didn't have any other moves after that. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5127.08s)]
*  It's a great move if you know how to... [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5128.64s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5132.360000000001s)]

*  He's a master at tripping people. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5138.8s)]
*  But you got to be wearing clothes. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5140.0s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5141.12s)]
*  Oh, to grab. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5141.96s)]

*  The problem with the... [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5152.92s)]
*  That was an issue in the beginning days of the UFC when a lot of guys went no-gi. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5154.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5159.24s)]
*  When they went to the ground game, they were so limited because they were so accustomed to grabbing collars and grabbing pants legs and grabbing sleeves. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5159.52s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5168.2s)]

*  All right. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5200.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's where I started. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5201.2s)]
*  I have actually named it. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5202.16s)]
*  10th Planet Jiu Jitsu is my idea. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5204.04s)]
*  That's yours? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5205.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5206.48s)]
*  Because we were talking about... [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5207.5199999999995s)]
*  It was me and Eddie Bravo. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5209.5199999999995s)]
*  And Eddie was... [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5210.96s)]
*  He just got back from tapping out Hoyler Gracie in Abu Dhabi. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5212.48s)]
*  And Eddie's the best guy ever. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5216.4s)]
*  He's my best friend. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5219.12s)]
*  When we went to Abu Dhabi and he tapped out Hoyler Gracie, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5221.92s)]
*  it was one of the most incredible things I've ever seen in my life. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5226.4s)]
*  And he came back from that. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5228.5599999999995s)]
*  John Jock Machado gave him his Black Belt off of his waist. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5230.4s)]
*  John Jock took his Black Belt on his back. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5234.24s)]
*  Oh, I saw that video. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5235.36s)]
*  He put it on Eddie. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5236.08s)]
*  And then Eddie started this 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5237.679999999999s)]
*  And the idea behind it was use... [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5240.799999999999s)]
*  Because in MMA, you don't have the gi. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5245.04s)]
*  So use over hooks and under hooks. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5247.839999999999s)]
*  And a lot of it was derived from what he learned from John Jock Machado [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5250.16s)]
*  was actually born with only one hand. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5253.04s)]
*  John Jock only has a thumb on his left hand. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5254.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5257.28s)]
*  So his Jiu Jitsu couldn't be all grip based. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5257.92s)]
*  It had to be under hooks and over hooks. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5261.36s)]
*  So he transitioned very easily to Abu Dhabi. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5263.76s)]
*  And he wound up winning. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5266.64s)]
*  Abu Dhabi is the biggest no gi competition in the world. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5267.84s)]
*  He wound up winning it and smoking people. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5270.24s)]
*  It was incredible to watch. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5272.0s)]
*  So Eddie comes back and Eddie decides to start this Jiu Jitsu gym. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5273.280000000001s)]
*  And we're joking around about all the different names. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5278.56s)]
*  We're probably high as fuck. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5280.56s)]
*  I imagine we're high as fuck. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5281.76s)]
*  And I said, why don't you just call it 10th Planet Jiu Jitsu? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5283.6s)]
*  Because it's like we were into Zachariah Sitchin back then. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5287.92s)]
*  You know who Zachariah Sitchin is? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5290.88s)]
*  The sci-fi guy? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5292.0s)]
*  Zachariah Sitchin was this guy who wrote these books [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5293.28s)]
*  about a planet called Nibiru. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5296.96s)]
*  And he was a guy who supposedly, not 100% right into this, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5299.36s)]
*  but it's fun. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5304.4s)]
*  I like this shit. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5304.96s)]
*  He had transcribed the Sumerian text. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5305.76s)]
*  And he believed that the history of the people from Sumer, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5311.36s)]
*  what they were trying to relay was that human beings [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5315.76s)]
*  were the product of accelerated evolution. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5318.96s)]
*  And that beings from a planet called Nibiru, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5321.36s)]
*  that's on a 3,600 year elliptical course towards the Earth. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5324.08s)]
*  I've been told this is nonsense by people who are cosmologists. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5331.759999999999s)]
*  Which is another thing that's nonsense. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5335.36s)]
*  What I said the other day, we were talking to Andrew Schultz [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5336.32s)]
*  that the moon doesn't spin because we only see one side of the moon. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5338.639999999999s)]
*  We do only see one side of the moon, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5342.24s)]
*  but it just spins perfectly with us. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5343.5199999999995s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5348.08s)]
*  You said it was tidal locked or something. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5348.48s)]
*  That's maybe what I was saying. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5350.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm in. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5350.96s)]
*  I love nonsense. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5351.52s)]
*  I definitely was wrong. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5354.16s)]
*  It does spin, right? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5355.6s)]
*  Excuse me, rotate. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5357.2s)]
*  People don't like the term spin. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5358.32s)]
*  Someone's trying to explain this to me. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5360.96s)]
*  I like spin class. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5362.24s)]
*  So it rotates at the exact same rate we do [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5363.76s)]
*  so that we always see the same side? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5366.8s)]
*  Is that why we see it? [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5368.16s)]
*  The time it takes for the moon to rotate once on its axis [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5368.64s)]
*  is equal to the time it takes for the moon to orbit once around the Earth. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5371.52s)]
*  This keeps the same side of the moon facing towards the Earth. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5374.56s)]
*  That's it. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5376.88s)]
*  Throughout the month. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5377.2s)]
*  So sorry for my misinformation, folks. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5377.84s)]
*  After I said it, I was like, I think this is off. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5381.28s)]
*  And then, yeah. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5383.36s)]
*  Hey, I was- [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5384.719999999999s)]
*  This Zechariah Sechin thing. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5385.84s)]
*  So anyway, this was Zechariah Sechin. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5387.44s)]
*  He wrote these books called, I think it was The Twelfth Planet was one of them. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5390.16s)]
*  And it was all about these ancient Sumerians. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5394.48s)]
*  And one of the weirdest things about it was like, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5398.96s)]
*  these people had these clay tablets that had a detailed map of the solar system. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5401.599999999999s)]
*  6,000 years ago, they carved it in clay. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5406.48s)]
*  And they also had these giant beings with like people with tails sitting on their lap. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5409.12s)]
*  And they had the double helix of the DNA. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5414.88s)]
*  And he interpreted all this as this was some sort of an ancient recording, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5417.28s)]
*  like where they were trying to record what had happened. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5423.36s)]
*  And when he was going through these ancient Sumerian texts, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5426.72s)]
*  he believes that it was really all about these beings called the Anunnaki. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5431.76s)]
*  Those from heaven to earth came. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5437.6s)]
*  And that these beings came from this planet that is described as Nibiru. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5440.0s)]
*  And that they have manipulated human DNA forever. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5445.84s)]
*  And they did it long time ago. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5449.92s)]
*  So you are into Star Wars. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5451.200000000001s)]
*  Well, it's- [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5453.84s)]
*  I worship at the altar of nonsense. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5454.56s)]
*  So everything you said to me right now, all in. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5456.8s)]
*  I'm all in on it, dude. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5460.240000000001s)]
*  It's so fun because if it really is the case, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5461.280000000001s)]
*  first of all, we know that we would do that. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5463.6s)]
*  100%. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5466.24s)]
*  We would do that. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5467.68s)]
*  We've done that to animals. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5468.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5469.5199999999995s)]
*  We've done all kinds of weird shit. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5470.16s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5471.76s)]
*  Made hybrids. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5472.08s)]
*  And of course, if people were designing, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5473.12s)]
*  they're making life forms in Petri dishes. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5477.44s)]
*  For sure, we would do that. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5480.88s)]
*  I don't know how close or far we're- [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5482.08s)]
*  Whatever all this gene splicing shit, I'm like, dude, if that's real, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5484.48s)]
*  I'm like, give it to me. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5488.5599999999995s)]

*  Tiger face. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5493.44s)]
*  Everybody's going to look like that guy from Prometheus. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5494.32s)]
*  Or the guy that dies in the alien movie Prometheus. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5496.88s)]
*  Don't you want cheetah legs and like- [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5499.04s)]
*  Yes! [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5500.96s)]

*  Probably. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5522.88s)]
*  I don't remember. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5524.96s)]

*  Okay. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5528.639999999999s)]
*  It's like- [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5529.2s)]
*  What? We're fucking- we're going all over the road. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5529.92s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5532.16s)]
*  I like it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5532.639999999999s)]
*  So in the same way, in the same way tonight, right? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5535.44s)]
*  If you go home tonight and you do like a hardcore jerk-off session to porn, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5540.639999999999s)]
*  you could watch more porn in 24 hours. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5547.04s)]
*  I don't know how accurate this is, but it's pretty accurate. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5550.32s)]
*  Than all of your ancestors since the beginning of time, right? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5552.72s)]
*  Of course. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5556.4800000000005s)]
*  You can watch thousands of people fucking tonight, whereas before the internet- [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5556.96s)]
*  So in the same way, when I was passing around tapes of Eddie Murphy, Raw, Delirious, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5562.56s)]
*  you could watch every comedy special in a week. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5570.72s)]
*  From the funniest guy in Dubai to the hottest guy in Hong Kong. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5573.76s)]
*  You could just download that shit, right? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5577.92s)]
*  And I actually want to make a quick comment on style for comedians. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5580.96s)]
*  I always remember what Martin Lawrence or Eddie Murphy was wearing. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5588.16s)]
*  Leather suit, no shirt. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5592.5599999999995s)]
*  Because not to be disrespectful, but isn't the art of comedy or the act of comedy, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5594.5599999999995s)]
*  you're a fool or you're a court jester or your job is to make- it's funny, right? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5601.68s)]
*  It's to make people laugh. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5605.84s)]
*  And then you have these comedians going on stage dressing in suits or dressing just in a hoodie. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5607.28s)]
*  You're a fucking clown, dude. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5615.2s)]
*  Dress ridiculous. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5616.5599999999995s)]
*  Look like this. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5617.92s)]
*  Entertain me. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5619.759999999999s)]
*  I see what you're saying, but I don't think so. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5620.5599999999995s)]
*  I think they should dress in any way that feels funny to them. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5623.44s)]
*  I've gone on stage in suits many times. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5629.12s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5631.28s)]
*  We get a kick out of it. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5632.16s)]
*  Really? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5633.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's a photo of us all in Vegas. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5633.759999999999s)]
*  We did the MGM and I said, dude, we should go and get rat pack like suits. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5635.6s)]
*  Get some dope fitted suits. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5640.400000000001s)]
*  And so had David August make everybody's suits. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5642.160000000001s)]
*  We just decided it would look cool and have fun. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5645.04s)]
*  But imagine- [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5648.320000000001s)]
*  The difference is trying to be cool. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5650.240000000001s)]
*  What people interpret when you see someone who's dressed up really nice, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5652.72s)]
*  or was wearing a lot of jewelry, or looks very flashy, they're trying to be cool. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5655.84s)]
*  You wouldn't have fun doing a stand-up set dressed like an alien? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5661.68s)]
*  No. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5665.4400000000005s)]
*  It's too on the nose. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5666.4800000000005s)]
*  Some people are, that's how they feel good. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5668.32s)]
*  They feel good when they dress nice. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5672.0s)]
*  They feel good when they wear nice shoes. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5673.52s)]
*  They feel good when they got a nice watch on. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5675.04s)]
*  They feel good. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5676.64s)]
*  So in feeling good, they'll go on stage, they'll perform better. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5677.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, this profession is like, it's a clown profession. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5680.8s)]
*  So I kind of want the outfit to match the- [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5684.16s)]
*  If you go watch Eddie Murphy, Delirious, I think he was probably wearing a leather jumpsuit or something. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5688.16s)]
*  Yeah, amazing. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5692.16s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5692.88s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5694.16s)]
*  Richard Pryor, live at the Sunset Strip, he has a blazer and a nice shirt on. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5696.5599999999995s)]
*  Look at that crazy outfit with his fucking zipper all the way down to his belly button. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5703.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was like eight when I saw that. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5708.32s)]
*  I'm like, I still remember it. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5711.04s)]
*  That was a classic, dude. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5712.96s)]
*  People don't know that if Eddie Murphy kept going, there would have been no doubt. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5714.96s)]
*  There would have been no doubt who the greatest comedian ever was. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5720.32s)]
*  Eddie Murphy just stopped doing it. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5723.04s)]
*  If you watch, Eddie Murphy was like a progression from, in many ways, like a progression from Richard Pryor. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5725.68s)]
*  Here's the new young Richard Pryor style of comedy. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5732.88s)]
*  And he was so good, man. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5736.4800000000005s)]
*  He was so fucking funny. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5738.72s)]
*  I'm glad he stopped. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5741.280000000001s)]
*  For me, the red outfit, interesting, right? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5742.4800000000005s)]
*  You took so much from Pryor. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5745.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, everybody did. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5746.88s)]
*  Everybody did. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5748.0s)]
*  Everybody took from Lenny Bruce. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5748.72s)]
*  Everybody took from Pryor. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5749.92s)]
*  I like the theme of getting out while you're ahead because there's always like, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5751.28s)]
*  Eddie's going to be back and he's going to kill. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5754.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like, he already killed. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5756.08s)]
*  He destroyed and he's a legend. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5757.36s)]
*  And just let him stay that way. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5759.04s)]
*  This thing where like- [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5760.4s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5761.599999999999s)]
*  This is why that's wrong. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5762.719999999999s)]
*  He's missing out on the chance to kill. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5765.04s)]
*  We were all hanging out in the green room the other night and we were laughing. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5768.4s)]
*  We were just laughing. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5771.12s)]
*  We had a bunch of really fun shows. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5771.679999999999s)]
*  And we're all hanging out in the green room. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5773.759999999999s)]
*  And we were saying, imagine living your life and never killing. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5775.2s)]
*  Never killing on stage. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5778.96s)]
*  Imagine living your whole life. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5780.72s)]
*  I'm like, that would suck. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5782.16s)]
*  The stage just looks different because doesn't he have like 12 kids? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5783.2s)]
*  Don't you think he's like the funniest dad ever? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5787.2s)]
*  For sure. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5789.44s)]
*  Like when he's making breakfast. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5790.32s)]
*  No, listen, that too. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5791.68s)]
*  The fuck, man. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5792.88s)]
*  You can do that too. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5793.6s)]
*  You could always do that too. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5794.56s)]
*  The difference is, it's like that guy we missed out on probably [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5796.4s)]
*  like the greatest talent that ever did stand up. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5800.88s)]
*  He stopped doing it. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5803.52s)]
*  Like stand up as an art form. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5804.88s)]
*  If you go watch Delirious and then listen to his first album, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5806.48s)]
*  which I think he was like 20 or something like that. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5810.4s)]
*  Something really young. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5813.2s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5814.24s)]
*  He was just a fucking amazing talent. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5816.4s)]
*  Just decided to stop doing it. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5823.12s)]
*  So that's why I don't agree. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5824.4s)]
*  Like if that guy just decided to start doing it again now [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5826.16s)]
*  and just started fucking around and people would let him walk on stage with notes. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5829.599999999999s)]
*  They would let him. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5834.08s)]
*  You could do whatever. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5835.28s)]
*  If they knew you were just working out on stuff, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5836.4s)]
*  people would let him do it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5839.92s)]
*  And he would get it again. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5841.599999999999s)]
*  Like he did a speech once at, what was it again? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5843.36s)]
*  For some award show. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5846.32s)]
*  He did the speech where he did a Bill Cosby impression, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5849.04s)]
*  talked about them taking Bill Cosby's awards away. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5852.08s)]
*  Mark Twain awards. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5855.04s)]
*  Mark Twain awards. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5855.84s)]
*  It was fucking hilarious. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5856.8s)]
*  It was like sharp. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5858.48s)]
*  The timing was on. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5859.759999999999s)]
*  I was like, if that guy kept doing comedy, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5860.8s)]
*  there would have been no doubt. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5863.759999999999s)]
*  He would have been number one of all time. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5865.28s)]
*  He was incredible. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5866.719999999999s)]
*  As a fan of comedy and who's watched, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5868.4s)]
*  because I have this access that everyone also has access to all these documentaries and comedies. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5871.44s)]
*  And this isn't just isolated to comedy. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5878.719999999999s)]
*  It's to anything, right? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5881.04s)]
*  Like everyone who I know who's a music. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5882.0s)]
*  Like when I heard one by Metallica, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5884.4s)]
*  there's no YouTube video that shows you how to do double face. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5890.4s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck is that? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5892.8s)]
*  You have to figure that out. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5894.16s)]
*  But now everyone who's spent a lifetime crafting whatever their art is, [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5895.5199999999995s)]
*  they're giving it away in a TikTok, right? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5899.92s)]
*  So when Louis CK has a special, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5902.0s)]
*  he goes on like 10 podcasts and talks about where the joke comes from. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5903.92s)]
*  So it's like the magician revealing all the magic tricks. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5909.5199999999995s)]
*  And part of that is great because like, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5912.48s)]
*  you're going to learn more now from YouTube than you are from like school or anything. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5915.36s)]
*  But because all the great artists, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5918.639999999999s)]
*  all the great magicians are giving away their wizardry, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5920.48s)]
*  like when they do the joke now, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5924.08s)]
*  you know like the surprise is gone. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5927.12s)]
*  You're like, oh, that's how we did. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5928.5599999999995s)]
*  Like you saw how they made the sausage. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5929.92s)]
*  So as someone who loves comedy, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5933.44s)]
*  this is how I feel. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5935.92s)]
*  And look, there's always exceptions to the rule, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5937.599999999999s)]
*  but most comedy I either feel like they're talking down to me [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5939.5199999999995s)]
*  or they're talking at me or they're trying to teach me or something like that. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5944.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like funny. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5948.4s)]
*  Number one priority. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5950.0s)]
*  Jokes. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5952.96s)]
*  Laugh. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5953.84s)]
*  And it's like, let me teach you something. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5954.16s)]
*  Let me show you what time it is. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5955.599999999999s)]
*  Let me do this. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5956.72s)]
*  And I'm like, there's so many podcasts that talk about the art of comedy, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5958.08s)]
*  the behind the stage, behind the scenes. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5963.12s)]
*  Now it's just like a normal dude that didn't know any of that shit. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5968.4s)]
*  There's too much shit. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5972.639999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, I just want the joke to just be a joke. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5974.16s)]
*  Like what if I knew everything about how Eddie Murphy came up with the raw act? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5978.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, this happens. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5982.88s)]
*  Does it aid the comedy or does it make it like you're watching a Ted talk or something? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5984.88s)]
*  It depends on how funny it is. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5992.32s)]
*  There's people that I know, like Shane Gillis, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5994.48s)]
*  I'll watch his set over and over and over again because I know it's funny. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=5997.2s)]
*  I know where the jokes are. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6001.04s)]
*  I still want to see them again and again. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6002.639999999999s)]
*  They're so funny. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6004.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6005.44s)]
*  It doesn't. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6006.0s)]

*  You don't like other people's art. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6034.96s)]
*  That would be ridiculous, but that happens to a lot of comedians. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6036.0s)]
*  They become comedians and they stop loving stand-up comedy [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6039.6s)]
*  as just someone in the audience. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6042.88s)]
*  Shit, man. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6045.84s)]

*  You could easily get like that with anything. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6056.4800000000005s)]
*  I get jaded with, like I don't watch porn anymore, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6058.56s)]
*  but I got so jaded with porn. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6061.12s)]
*  I got jaded with music. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6062.64s)]
*  And then I end up going back to like the classics of stuff [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6065.04s)]
*  that is nostalgic or that or whatever. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6067.6s)]

*  man fucking life sucks, let me laugh tonight. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6074.16s)]
*  And I watch these things, I go, I could see, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6077.2s)]
*  like this is a hot take, no disrespect to Chris Rock, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6080.08s)]
*  but like I didn't even know Marlon Waynes was a stand-up comedian [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6082.5599999999995s)]
*  and his take on the whole Will Smith thing was fucking hilarious. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6086.0s)]
*  And Chris Rocks was like, I don't know, [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6090.72s)]
*  I just didn't do it. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6094.160000000001s)]

*  It didn't land for me. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6097.200000000001s)]
*  And everything I saw on the internet was like, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6098.8s)]
*  he just bodied Will Smith. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6101.68s)]
*  He fucking killed him. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6103.200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, did he? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6104.240000000001s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6105.4400000000005s)]

*  And so I did psychedelics recently. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6115.280000000001s)]
*  And like I said, I accused you of being an alien last time. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6120.080000000001s)]
*  You're here. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6123.5199999999995s)]
*  And like the person that makes me laugh more than anybody [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6124.96s)]
*  is when I'm fucking on psychedelics [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6130.96s)]

*  Because everyone's like, oh, I'm going to have a spiritual experience. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6221.44s)]
*  And it is spiritual, but it's a long trip. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6224.08s)]
*  So it goes through hell, heaven, jokes. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6227.12s)]

*  We fuck- we're mind fuckers. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6241.5199999999995s)]
*  We use our mind. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6243.12s)]
*  That's how we have sex. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6243.759999999999s)]
*  And so we're beyond that. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6245.04s)]

*  And I go, what? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6248.4s)]
*  You ever wonder why Koreans have such big heads, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6249.44s)]
*  and your eyes are a little bit like this, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6251.759999999999s)]
*  and your dicks are a little bit smaller? [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6253.679999999999s)]
*  Because we didn't have any dicks. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6255.04s)]
*  Humans had dicks. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6256.48s)]
*  We melted, and so you have little dicks. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6257.599999999999s)]

*  And I'm like, what are you talking about, dude? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6268.96s)]
*  Like, I'm like on the floor tripping. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6270.96s)]
*  So I don't know if you know this, a lot of Asians, [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6273.6s)]
*  and they say they call it the Genghis Khan birthmark. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6276.96s)]
*  Do you know this? [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6280.4800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6281.04s)]
*  Okay, so they call it- Jamie, look up like, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6281.6s)]
*  Asian blue birth- so a lot of Asians are born with a giant blue birthmark on their ass. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6287.84s)]
*  Really? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6293.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and they say it's all the way back from something Genghis Khan did. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6293.68s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6297.84s)]
*  Yeah, look, go down. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6299.280000000001s)]
*  The Mongolian blue spot. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6300.16s)]
*  So I was born with a blue ass, Joe. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6303.4400000000005s)]
*  I had a blue fucking ass. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6306.16s)]
*  Dude, like Avatar? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6309.52s)]
*  Dude, I have a picture of my- and some have a small one like this, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6311.200000000001s)]
*  and some of them have- I'm sure you could find bluer ones, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6316.96s)]
*  but then after like less than a year, it just disappears. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6320.0s)]
*  So it's called the Mongolian birthmark, [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6323.68s)]
*  and I'd forgot about it till the alien was talking to me. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6325.92s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6328.400000000001s)]

*  See? Mine looked more like that. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6330.08s)]
*  So I was born with a blue ass. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6332.240000000001s)]
*  And so they know specifically from genetics that this goes back to the Mongol days? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6334.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I'm telling you who gave me the answer. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6339.68s)]
*  The altar that I worship at, nonsense. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6341.76s)]
*  So the alien goes, [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6344.8s)]
*  you think you just had a blue ass out of nowhere? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6347.12s)]

*  It's going to get in the way. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6360.56s)]
*  I gave you a perfect dick. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6361.76s)]
*  You fuck people with your mind and you're fucking- you're not yellow. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6363.4400000000005s)]
*  You're fucking blue. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6367.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, it's not a Mongolian birthmark. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6369.12s)]
*  He's like, Mongolian? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6371.92s)]
*  You're fucking alien birthmark. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6372.8s)]
*  And I was like, you know, I'm drooling. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6374.8s)]
*  I'm like- [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6376.56s)]
*  And look, I did a horrible job. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6379.6s)]
*  His delivery is way more vulgar. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6381.839999999999s)]
*  It sounds more like Eddie Murphy and his- he's like cussing. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6385.2s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6390.0s)]
*  It's like in my mind, I'm like, this is not what I was expecting out of this spiritual journey. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6392.0s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, it was- you never heard of the Mongolian birthmark? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6398.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know the exact story, but it's something with like Genghis Khan or someone did so much fucking that- [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6403.919999999999s)]
*  Genghis Khan apparently did a lot of fucking. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6410.24s)]
*  Yeah, like- [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6412.48s)]
*  Some large percentage of the population. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6413.04s)]
*  That did something to make that birthmark, but it was clarified to me by- [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6414.96s)]
*  That wouldn't really happen. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6421.44s)]
*  So that is actually that story. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6422.88s)]
*  Okay, one Mongolian spot is present on over 90% of Native Americans and people of African descent. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6425.36s)]
*  Over 80% of Asians, over 70% of Hispanics, and just under 10% of fair-skinned infants. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6432.08s)]
*  Huh. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6438.96s)]
*  You didn't have a blue ass? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6439.46s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6440.32s)]
*  Nobody told me. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6441.2s)]
*  Maybe they just kept it from me. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6442.0s)]
*  My kids had blue asses. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6443.44s)]
*  Yeah, some Mexicans have- [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6445.12s)]
*  That story he's saying is in your psychedelic trip is literally the same story that's in the Sumerian text. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6445.76s)]
*  That's why when- [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6454.08s)]
*  That's what's- [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6454.8s)]
*  That's why when you say- [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6455.28s)]
*  Wait, in the Sumerian text, they say Asians are spawns of- [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6458.4s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6461.04s)]
*  Humans. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6461.92s)]
*  Humans, what happened was these advanced beings came down and they manipulated our DNA and added their DNA. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6462.88s)]
*  But by the way, I have to say this. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6470.160000000001s)]
*  This is this guy, Zechariah Sitchin, and he's very controversial. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6472.08s)]
*  He's like a legit scholar, rock solid credentials, but he's also very controversial. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6476.8s)]
*  I think there's a whole website called Sitchiniswrong.com. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6483.68s)]
*  Joe, you're talking to- [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6487.4400000000005s)]
*  If that's for your audience, I already believe you're an alien, so you don't need to- [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6489.200000000001s)]
*  I'm just clarifying to people that this is not- I think this theory is fun as fuck and I love it, but I don't know if it's true. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6492.88s)]
*  People ask me- I think one of the most taboo things to talk about today is you could talk about fucking or drugs. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6500.56s)]
*  You could talk about anything, but when anyone goes, hey, where's your spirituality at? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6507.68s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6512.08s)]
*  It's like a conversation stopper, right? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6512.96s)]
*  You know why? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6515.12s)]
*  Because anybody who asks it like that is annoying. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6515.6s)]
*  Where's your spirituality at right now, David? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6519.4400000000005s)]
*  David. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6521.84s)]
*  That's like a- [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6522.48s)]
*  That's in my blue asshole right now. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6523.599999999999s)]
*  Someone's henpecking you. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6524.879999999999s)]
*  What are you doing, David? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6526.24s)]
*  But I've never asked you that. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6527.599999999999s)]
*  Where is- what is your thoughts on God? [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6529.2s)]
*  I did it. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6532.08s)]
*  I went there. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6532.48s)]
*  Well, considering having a podcast, it's very different than someone just bringing it out of nowhere. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6534.799999999999s)]
*  I am not an atheist. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6540.16s)]
*  I've never been an atheist. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6542.24s)]
*  I've never been someone who says I know there is no God. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6543.759999999999s)]
*  What I have been someone who has said that a lot of the stories, there are a lot of the religions, [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6546.5599999999995s)]
*  clearly have the hand of man on them. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6553.5199999999995s)]
*  There's clearly some description that implies things that are okay to do because of the cultural [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6556.8s)]
*  values of people that lived 3,000, 4,000 years ago whenever they wrote this stuff. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6566.24s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6571.44s)]
*  It condones slavery, it treats women as second-class citizens. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6572.4s)]
*  There's a lot in these words that clearly have the hand of man. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6576.24s)]
*  But there's also some inherent deep wisdom and moral scaffolding that would make the [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6581.84s)]
*  world a better place, and almost all of them. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6590.5599999999995s)]
*  There's something there that gives people structure and discipline and connects them [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6593.04s)]
*  in a community of like-minded people who believe the same thing. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6597.84s)]
*  I think there's a great value to that that's underappreciated by people who call themselves [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6601.6s)]
*  atheists. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6606.0s)]
*  I think there's also a great value in if you truly believe you're living your life [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6607.120000000001s)]
*  and you're going to be a good person, you're going to go to heaven, you will have that [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6612.400000000001s)]
*  energy through your life. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6616.56s)]
*  You will be carrying the belief and it will actually aid you in your life. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6618.240000000001s)]
*  And that if you think there's just pointless, it's all just existential angst and it's all [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6624.320000000001s)]
*  chaos. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6629.6s)]
*  You live better if you believe that this is all for a better purpose and this is all a [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6630.96s)]
*  part of a God's plan. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6637.92s)]
*  That might be true, it might not be true, but you live better if you think that way. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6640.96s)]
*  You can do that and still look at facts and reality and you don't have to be ideologically [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6648.16s)]
*  captured by some writing that was written down thousands of years ago. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6655.28s)]
*  But you are better off if you believe that this is all for a greater good. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6661.12s)]
*  Love. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6668.24s)]
*  Love. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6669.12s)]
*  Yeah, and that's probably what God really is. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6669.5199999999995s)]
*  God is love. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6671.599999999999s)]
*  What love is at its most pure is a force of creation, a force of like adhesion and bonding [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6673.04s)]
*  of human beings. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6680.16s)]
*  And we know the opposite. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6681.12s)]
*  The opposite is what's happening right now in Ukraine. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6682.639999999999s)]
*  That's the opposite. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6685.12s)]
*  The opposite is... [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6685.92s)]
*  That's hate. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6686.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's murder and fucking whole scale murder. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6688.320000000001s)]
*  It's wild chaos. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6693.68s)]
*  I mean, war is hell. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6695.12s)]
*  It's the worst thing, the worst thing that people do. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6696.72s)]
*  And that exists at the same time on earth with some of the best people enjoying some [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6700.0s)]
*  of the best times together. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6705.4400000000005s)]
*  It's... [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6708.0s)]
*  While you are with your family and you are with your friends and people come over your [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6709.599999999999s)]
*  house and you have dinner and you're laughing and having a good time, on some part of the [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6714.8s)]
*  world someone's drinking out of a puddle. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6719.44s)]
*  Some part of the world someone's in an apartment building that just got hit by a missile. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6722.32s)]
*  It's all happening simultaneously, but we only have the ability to understand what's [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6727.76s)]
*  happening to us. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6731.84s)]
*  And we kind of think these things... [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6733.52s)]
*  We know these things are out there because we watch TV and we watch the news, but we [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6736.64s)]
*  don't believe it. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6740.96s)]
*  There's people that are calling for war in Ukraine. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6743.6s)]
*  You don't even know what you're saying. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6746.320000000001s)]
*  You don't even know what that feeling is. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6748.320000000001s)]
*  If you knew, that would be the last thing you would ever want to happen. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6751.12s)]
*  I fucking love you, man. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6755.360000000001s)]

*  And wow. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6762.0s)]
*  Part of the thing... [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6767.92s)]
*  I love what you just said right now. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6769.44s)]
*  And part of the way I pray is creativity. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6770.799999999999s)]
*  Like when I make something, that's how I interpret prayer. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6774.639999999999s)]
*  And what you talked about is this belief. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6778.5599999999995s)]
*  It's faith, right? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6783.44s)]
*  So... [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6784.64s)]
*  And part of why... [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6786.72s)]
*  A lot of things I've done in my life, people have accused me of being suicidal. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6790.0s)]
*  They're like, why are you going into MS-13 territory? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6794.8s)]
*  Why are you going to the Congo? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6797.360000000001s)]
*  Why are you going to Bosnia? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6798.64s)]
*  Why are you going to places that are in conflict? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6800.320000000001s)]
*  And part of that is like, I like it when it hurts. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6803.280000000001s)]
*  And it's just like I'm attracted towards darkness, or I was. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6806.160000000001s)]
*  And part of that is just, I don't believe. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6811.5199999999995s)]
*  Like I watch the news, I watch something, and someone tells me, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6814.4s)]
*  I've been to every state in America, right? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6817.2s)]
*  Like most Americans haven't done that. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6820.0s)]
*  And is there unrest? [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6822.4s)]
*  Is there racism? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6824.96s)]
*  Yes, there is. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6826.24s)]
*  But when you try to say everything, like try to make it binary and everything in like black or white, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6827.28s)]
*  like I've had an amazing time in Texas so far, right? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6833.839999999999s)]
*  And all these places that are considered racist, yeah, I've experienced that also. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6838.400000000001s)]
*  But even when I go to like Atlanta at a black mall, I went to the wrong mall, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6842.88s)]
*  and everyone's yelling shit to me, if I could find one kid and be like, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6848.72s)]
*  hey, why are you calling me that shit? [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6852.4800000000005s)]
*  And then I bond with him. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6854.160000000001s)]
*  In that moment, I'm just with him. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6855.68s)]
*  I've used love, and he didn't run away from me. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6857.200000000001s)]
*  Like him and all of his friends were doing this. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6860.320000000001s)]
*  They were like, and I was like, this is like 20 years ago. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6862.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, fuck, dude. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6864.8s)]
*  And they were yelling. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6867.28s)]
*  They're literally yelling. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6868.0s)]
*  You came to the wrong mall, bro. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6868.88s)]
*  And I was like, oh, shit. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6871.92s)]
*  And I felt threatened. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6873.2s)]
*  I felt like, oh, shit, like something's about to happen. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6874.24s)]
*  And this is 1999 or something. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6876.88s)]
*  You know? [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6881.44s)]
*  And so because of the religious abuse that I was raised in, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6882.719999999999s)]
*  and it's crazy because most of the mental health institutions or rehabs I've been into, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6889.679999999999s)]
*  you've heard about sexual abuse, physical abuse. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6895.360000000001s)]
*  You've heard of those abuses. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6898.72s)]
*  I had never heard the word sexual abuse or religious abuse. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6899.92s)]
*  And I'm like, it's disproportionately a lot of Orthodox Catholics, Orthodox Jews, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6902.72s)]
*  hardcore Muslims, hardcore Christians, hardcore Mormons. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6908.16s)]
*  It's just that organized, you have to be like this or else you're bad, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6910.88s)]
*  creates so much shame. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6916.72s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck God, fuck religion, fuck all. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6918.64s)]
*  But now I've gone the other side towards hate. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6921.84s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm a loving person. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6924.16s)]
*  I was telling you, it's not an accident that you're the biggest podcast in the world. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6926.32s)]
*  You're such a sweet, loving, you don't get involved with all this other bullshit podcast [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6931.28s)]
*  drama that all of these are, you're just loving. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6936.639999999999s)]
*  You're love. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6939.44s)]
*  You're lovable. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6940.0s)]
*  You are love. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6940.88s)]
*  And so I always go, I tend to be a hater. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6941.599999999999s)]
*  I'm always pushed to talk shit or be bitter and fuck everything sucks. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6945.44s)]
*  And I need love to drag me back. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6948.88s)]
*  And so part of that is, this is part of 12 step stuff like higher power and whatever is [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6951.52s)]
*  we like having a team, right? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6959.6s)]
*  I'm a Christian. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6961.84s)]
*  Our symbol is this. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6962.72s)]
*  I have a star. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6964.0s)]
*  Ours has 20 arms and swords. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6965.4400000000005s)]
*  Everyone wants to have a logo and a t-shirt. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6968.080000000001s)]
*  And my church is this. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6970.240000000001s)]
*  Mars are round. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6972.0s)]
*  Ours are like Gothic. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6972.88s)]
*  That's good. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6975.360000000001s)]
*  It's good to have that. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6976.400000000001s)]
*  But I was so jaded and I was so bitter and the guy that was helping me through all my [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6978.08s)]
*  darkness was like, kind of don't care. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6983.84s)]
*  I kind of don't care if you believe in God or not. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6986.64s)]
*  It's just like, like a fake it till you make it. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6988.64s)]
*  He's like, I just want you to believe and have the faith. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6991.28s)]
*  Whether you believe it or not is irrelevant. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6995.92s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6997.76s)]
*  He's like, it's just weird talking to you because no one believed you'd be the wealthiest artist [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=6998.72s)]
*  in the world, except for you. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7004.24s)]
*  That's insane amount of faith that got you there. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7005.84s)]
*  No one thought you would do this in your life. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7008.4800000000005s)]
*  No one thought and you were the only one, maybe your mom. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7010.24s)]
*  But because you believed it, it happened. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7013.92s)]
*  So it doesn't matter if 10th planet is ludicrous or the science, like even science is a religion. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7016.24s)]
*  How many times has science been wrong? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7022.400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7024.0s)]
*  Well, science is data. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7024.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7025.84s)]
*  It's scientists and their interpretations. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7026.32s)]
*  It's incorrect or biased. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7028.72s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7030.64s)]
*  And calling it the science when people say that trust the science. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7031.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7034.32s)]
*  And the scientist is the priest. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7034.56s)]
*  It's a scientific process. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7036.320000000001s)]
*  So I subscribe to what you said of like, that's, you know, sorry to sound like a douche again, [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7037.68s)]
*  but that's where I find my spirituality is like community. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7044.88s)]
*  It's what they call, I just learned this, third space, right? [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7049.6s)]
*  First space and second space is like your house is like first space, I think. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7054.96s)]
*  Second space is like work where you work. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7060.0s)]
*  And then third space is what people need to like be social. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7061.76s)]
*  Like whether that's a cafe, church, the gym and third space is the internet now. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7065.12s)]
*  All right. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7070.8s)]
*  That's just where everyone congregates. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7071.04s)]
*  And like, I don't, I do all these limitations on my phone and technology. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7073.280000000001s)]
*  So it keeps me off social media, keeps me off all these things. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7076.8s)]
*  I have a child safe, like, you know, that's because of my addictive nature, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7080.64s)]
*  but that's where people are. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7085.280000000001s)]
*  So that's where I have to meet them. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7086.64s)]
*  So yeah, the way, and you know, I'm still searching, like I'm not perfect, obviously, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7088.24s)]
*  but I try to do, anytime something happens and I feel myself going to the dark side, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7094.24s)]
*  fuck this motherfucker, this whatever is like, how can I meet you with love? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7100.48s)]
*  And then I feel better. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7105.04s)]
*  Selfishly, I feel better. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7106.96s)]
*  It's like, cause so much of Korean identity is revenge, right? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7108.96s)]
*  If you watch old boy or any Korean show on Netflix, it's all about, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7117.2s)]
*  you tripped me when I was five and now I've spent my entire life figuring it out. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7121.2s)]
*  You know, right? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7125.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7126.32s)]
*  And so to bring it back to the acting thing, I get this role, right? [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7128.5599999999995s)]
*  I play this asshole, like kind of lovable asshole. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7136.08s)]
*  I just added that. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7140.32s)]
*  And then I show up to the set. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7142.32s)]
*  And again, I write a short story back page, like a thing I'm doing improv. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7143.84s)]
*  I have all these and they're like, Dave, can you just do the lines so that other people [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7151.360000000001s)]
*  can go home? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7155.360000000001s)]
*  Like no one's asking you to write another like, and I'm like, I don't know how to not do that. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7155.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7162.4800000000005s)]
*  So my character is always yelling at my cousin. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7163.04s)]
*  Doesn't someone know you that works with them that could like talk and go, hey, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7165.4400000000005s)]
*  you got to let Dave know that you can't invent any new stuff and put it in the movie. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7179.04s)]

*  like I feel like I'm like Aquaman's a douchebag. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7186.16s)]
*  The guardians of the galaxy are like D list for four dollar bin. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7189.68s)]
*  The fact that we live in a world now that like Aquaman, Wonder Woman, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7194.0s)]
*  Iron Iron Man's like the worst. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7198.4800000000005s)]
*  No one reads Iron Man. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7200.4s)]

*  these are human bodies that are hanging from there. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7414.080000000001s)]

*  And yours, you tend more towards werewolves, blood, vampires. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7543.04s)]
*  No, you like the monsters, right? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7546.96s)]
*  You're more of a monster guy. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7549.28s)]
*  But yeah, my point with all of it was just the fact that as a create, I'm a super nerd. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7551.84s)]
*  I fucking buy original comic. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7557.2s)]
*  As someone like that, it's kind of surreal to be in a world where someone's mom knows [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7559.2s)]
*  who Tony Stark is, right? [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7565.2s)]
*  Only nerds would know that, right? [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7566.96s)]
*  Right, back in the day. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7568.24s)]
*  So I'm having a very similar feeling on set because I've done artwork or other, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7569.28s)]
*  I've been on movie sets before and I've just, I've never been in a scenario where [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7574.08s)]
*  95% of Beef, the Netflix show I did, the cast is Asian. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7580.64s)]
*  So like, at the height of my gambling, right? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7585.76s)]
*  When I'm being flown to Macau, when I'm flying and taking every like penthouse suite in Vegas, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7591.36s)]
*  that was a surreal like, here's a bus full of hookers. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7596.64s)]
*  Here's every drug you want, even though you don't do drugs. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7601.2s)]
*  Here's like, everyone's calling me sir, Mr. Cho. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7603.76s)]
*  Like that doesn't happen anywhere else in my life, except for there. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7607.6s)]
*  And then I arrive on set and like, there's a giant Netflix fruit basket. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7611.280000000001s)]
*  And like, I like open my water, take a sip, and then like a white guy comes and goes, [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7616.88s)]
*  let me get you a fresh water, sir. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7622.8s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, it's cool, bro. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7624.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is why Hollywood people are fucked up. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7626.0s)]
*  Because this is not natural. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7630.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7632.400000000001s)]
*  This is fucking weird, dude. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7632.88s)]
*  Like people are licking my ass, like, and like, I like it. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7634.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm like, this feels good. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7637.52s)]
*  But I don't think- [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7638.88s)]
*  Glad you said that. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7640.0s)]
*  Well, the thing I said before about like Asians, I've only seen them as Kung Fu masters or waiters [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7640.88s)]
*  or nerds. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7646.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I get to play like a real person. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7647.36s)]
*  And I don't have to like code switch or I don't have to pretend to be this kind of Asian or that. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7650.32s)]
*  Like, I'm just me. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7654.64s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7655.6s)]
*  But the weirdness is the way they treat the stars. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7655.84s)]
*  Oh, dude, I'm like- [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7658.4800000000005s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7659.2s)]
*  I was like, bro, I'll get my own food, you know? [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7660.32s)]
*  Like I get to my room and they're like- [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7662.16s)]
*  And it's like if acting or Hollywood is a religion or a cult, like it's just everyone there is buying in. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7665.2s)]
*  Right? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7670.72s)]
*  Like the lighting guy wants to be- [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7671.04s)]
*  Well, that's- [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7672.64s)]
*  If you're an atheist and you're really into acting. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7673.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7676.08s)]
*  You know, there's certain people that are your gods. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7676.64s)]
*  They're your deities. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7679.04s)]
*  So yeah, I went as someone who- [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7680.8s)]
*  Look, I don't know how you perceive me, but I perceive myself over the last- [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7684.16s)]
*  All the spiritual work, all the work I've been doing, all the insane fucking rehabs and mental institutions. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7688.0s)]
*  I'm a fucking chill dude. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7693.6s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7695.76s)]
*  But I didn't- [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7697.36s)]
*  That wasn't my role for this character. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7698.16s)]
*  I had to go back to old 19- [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7699.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7701.6s)]
*  And so now I'm at with my family at a deli getting a Reuben and you know, my wife's like, [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7701.92s)]
*  that was a very aggressive Reuben order. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7707.84s)]
*  You know, like, I'm like over here. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7710.0s)]
*  And I kind of don't like how I feel. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7712.72s)]
*  And I'm like, you know, I'm talking to Ali. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7715.28s)]
*  I'm talking to Steve. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7717.2s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know how you guys do this and not lose your mind. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7717.92s)]
*  And they're like, Dave, you don't have to go method. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7720.24s)]
*  And I go, I don't know how to not do that. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7722.96s)]
*  Like, I don't have that button. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7725.84s)]
*  So you're doing meth. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7726.8s)]
*  So you're ordering food in character? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7728.24s)]
*  I wasn't trying to. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7730.16s)]
*  It just was, they called it leaking. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7731.2s)]
*  I was leaking like fucking crazy. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7732.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7734.639999999999s)]
*  Like I was like that guy because I'm like- [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7735.36s)]
*  Yeah, don't do that. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7738.48s)]
*  And then the thing is like, if you're like, I play all, I act all day with my kid, right? [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7739.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm fucking, I'm playing and then it's fun. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7743.36s)]
*  The objective is fun. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7747.28s)]
*  But if I'm waving a gun at someone's face and I'm like, fuck you. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7748.72s)]
*  And that, and like Ali Wong's my friend. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7751.84s)]
*  I don't want to fucking yell at my friend. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7753.4400000000005s)]
*  And the guy says, cut again. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7755.36s)]
*  Fuck you. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7757.52s)]
*  Cut. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7758.4800000000005s)]
*  Fuck you. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7758.96s)]
*  Cut. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7759.76s)]
*  At the end of the day, like I've just been screaming, fuck you, waving a gun. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7760.400000000001s)]
*  And like, maybe if I grew up as an actor, but like I go, that doesn't feel good. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7764.8s)]
*  Like my, that doesn't feel good to me. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7769.36s)]
*  And, and so I like kind of like lost my mind playing this character. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7772.64s)]
*  And so I checked myself into a mental hospital for a week. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7778.08s)]
*  Oh my God, Dave. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7781.4400000000005s)]
*  I was like, like why not? [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7782.88s)]
*  I called this place that I used to go to like- [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7784.24s)]
*  So just playing this character, like- [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7785.84s)]
*  I lost my fucking mind. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7788.16s)]
*  Hit a switch in your brain? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7789.2s)]
*  I lost my mind. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7789.92s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7790.96s)]
*  I lost my mind. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7791.36s)]
*  And then I went to the Mississippi. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7792.96s)]
*  I go there all the time. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7794.64s)]
*  And- [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7795.92s)]
*  Can I talk to you about this? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7796.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7797.52s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7798.08s)]
*  Just the path of the mind, right? [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7798.4s)]
*  How much, how flexible is the idea of losing your mind? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7800.96s)]
*  Like, is it, when you're, when you're at a good state of mind, [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7809.44s)]
*  you're in a good state of mind and something comes along, like how flexible is your mentality? [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7815.12s)]
*  Does it immediately go into this new groove? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7820.32s)]
*  Like if you decide you're going to be in character, you're going to play this asshole, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7824.08s)]
*  does that become you? [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7827.84s)]
*  Like, and how much of who we are, who we assume we are, is just a program that we're running [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7830.16s)]
*  so that the weirdness of life doesn't give us unbearable anxiety. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7837.04s)]
*  So we're running a program, and that program is [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7841.92s)]
*  most of your past thoughts and experiences and the things you've learned and done, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7845.12s)]
*  and then interface that with the rest of the world. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7851.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you decide, because you're playing a role, that you're a fucking asshole, [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7855.84s)]
*  like I wonder how much of what we are is choices where, for you it was just acting, [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7861.12s)]
*  because you wanted to be an asshole for a movie, but for other people, like how much of who you are [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7867.6s)]
*  is because of the way people behave around you? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7872.400000000001s)]
*  And how, like, how vulnerable are we to other people's behavior and thinking and just, like, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7876.16s)]
*  let's go back to the Hadza where you were talking about these people all eating those brains. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7884.0s)]
*  For them, that is completely normal. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7888.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7891.28s)]
*  It's completely normal. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7891.68s)]
*  It's a highlight. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7892.88s)]
*  So it doesn't, right, so it doesn't feel bizarre. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7893.36s)]
*  Oh, for you, culturally, you've never experienced this before, you're there, it's wild. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7896.0s)]
*  You're like, holy shit, this is crazy to see, that all of it's crazy to see. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7901.04s)]
*  But isn't that, that seems to be the fucking case with everything. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7905.52s)]
*  I think the human mind, like what we accept and what becomes normal to us, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7910.48s)]
*  I think it's very malleable, really malleable. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7915.12s)]
*  Oh, I mean, absolutely, and as someone, if you're a really good human or artist that you have [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7918.96s)]
*  walls down and you're like a conduit, then things affect you. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7925.44s)]
*  If I'm like jaded and my walls are like this, then I could watch a snuff film or, like, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7930.48s)]
*  have the worst shit happen and it's just like, whatever, I could see a guy dying on the street. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7935.28s)]
*  But don't you think if you had that way of thinking, you couldn't be creative? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7939.5199999999995s)]
*  It's almost like that way of thinking, like you're putting up a barrier to sensitivity, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7943.759999999999s)]
*  which is like so important for any kind of art. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7948.5599999999995s)]
*  You have to be sensitive. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7952.16s)]
*  Well, look, part of just existing, part of existing for me, like people, when I think of [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7953.04s)]
*  how people are sensitive to racism right now, right, and they're like, I can't believe they [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7960.32s)]
*  made a racist joke or whatever, and I'm like, I grew up in the 80s, the 70s, and the coolest [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7966.64s)]
*  kid at school would be like, David Chow, how do you say your name, Chow Ching Chong, and guess what [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7972.56s)]
*  I would do? If it was like a Disney movie, I would like stand up, hey, you can't talk to me. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7977.84s)]
*  That's not what happened. I laughed. I was like, I don't know what to do in this moment, and I don't [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7982.320000000001s)]
*  want to like go against everyone else's laughing, so I guess I'll just laugh. Yeah, yeah, and I'll [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7986.56s)]
*  just laugh, so I'm like laughing at a racist joke in the 80s against me because that's the mask or [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7992.88s)]
*  whatever, and I think what you're asking, it depends how open you are, how sensitive you are [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=7999.4400000000005s)]
*  to other people's energies, and also just quite frankly, if you're an addict or not, if you have [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8005.68s)]
*  that addict. But you become another person while playing a person, like this is a narrative in [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8010.24s)]
*  movies where a pandemic hits and then a person becomes a savage, right, right, like that is in [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8015.12s)]
*  The Last of Us, that the gentleman Pascale, what is his name? Pedro Pascale. Pedro Pascale, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8022.48s)]
*  amazing in that show, but that's the role, he was a normal guy, and then all of a sudden, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8028.08s)]
*  spoiler alert, he's not a normal guy by the end of the show, that human beings can become other [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8035.2s)]
*  things. Very quickly. Very quickly. That's what's so weird about behavior. I mean, you saw, like, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8042.4s)]
*  were you in LA when the pandemic started? Oh yeah. Yeah. Like, you go from normal to about to kill [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8048.56s)]
*  someone over toilet paper. What was that, a week into the pandemic? It wasn't very long. Yeah. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8054.080000000001s)]
*  And there was no real disruptions, no real disruptions, disruptions to work, but what I'm [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8059.4400000000005s)]
*  saying is like, food was available, and the power was on, and what got crazy during that time was, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8064.56s)]
*  even under the best case scenario of total disruption of the country, because the best [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8073.04s)]
*  case scenario would be, it's not for a war, it's not, you know, like, the power doesn't go out, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8081.28s)]
*  like, there's a lot of scenarios that you could see way worse than what the pandemic was, but look [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8087.04s)]
*  at the fucking damage it did. Look at the damage it did to people psychologically. Look at the damage [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8092.4800000000005s)]
*  it did to the two businesses, the small businesses. Look at the damage it did to information. Look at [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8097.52s)]
*  the damage it did to, you know, propaganda and the way people think about the news. I mean, look at [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8103.92s)]
*  the damage it did to the idea that the people that are running the country have a good sense of how [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8110.88s)]
*  to take care of things like this. I mean, fear, real or imagined, is, I mean, there's a quote [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8116.88s)]
*  about it where like most of these things that you're scared of will almost never happen, right? So [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8124.88s)]
*  you live a life, like wound up, guns, you're like ready for the worst thing and it'll never happen. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8130.24s)]
*  But that's before the pandemic. Right. See, there was people that were like that already. Yes. And [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8136.96s)]
*  then the pandemic came along and cracked them. Yeah. And there's a lot of folks like that. I was looking at [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8141.84s)]
*  tanks on Craigslist. I was like, I'm gonna buy a tank, dude. There's a lot of people. I was looking [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8146.0s)]
*  at that helicopter where a tank could go into. I was looking on websites for that. Well, that's why [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8151.360000000001s)]
*  we freak out at things like the walking dead, because we know that if things go south, people [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8157.04s)]
*  will revert to their worst instincts quickly when there's no internet and there's no way to share [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8164.240000000001s)]
*  information and communicate that someone did this and this happened. And if there's no like, [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8170.64s)]
*  you could take a film of someone murdering someone and then they could catch that guy from the news. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8175.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, that happens now. Right. Right. But if you're in walking dead times, there's no power. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8179.92s)]
*  Right. Right. So no one is no one knows what the fuck is going on. And the only way people [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8185.12s)]
*  organize, they get together and they yell. Some guy yells at a group of people and then they [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8190.64s)]
*  they do barbaric shit. And this is what the nature of human beings has been for many thousands of [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8195.68s)]
*  years. That's why it's so easy for us to like snap back into us. Right. And culturally, there's a [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8202.88s)]
*  reason why we like superheroes because we want someone to come save us. Culturally, there's a [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8208.32s)]
*  reason why zombies are fucking so big right now. Right. Zombies weren't this big back. You know, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8214.64s)]
*  it's because when you see a new movie, new sci fi, it's always post apocalyptic, post apocalyptic, [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8220.08s)]
*  post apocalyptic. It's on our minds. It's on our soul. We're going to fuck this up. It's heading [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8225.52s)]
*  this way. And it's look, as someone who was raised in the church, like the apocalypse, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8229.36s)]
*  Revelations is the shortest book in the Bible. So you're like, you go, oh, it's like just like 20 [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8237.2s)]
*  pages or whatever. The what happens in those 20 pages like spans thousands of years. So we, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8241.84s)]
*  a lot of people discuss that we're in that now. Right. Yeah. So people go, oh, AI, like this and [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8248.400000000001s)]
*  that. And, you know, whatever, I'm sure you have way smarter people to talk about that. But I go [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8253.84s)]
*  back to that's one by Metallica. And if we can go back to early 2000s, that's Lars Ulrich from [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8259.04s)]
*  Metallica trying to sue or all of Metallica trying to sue Sean Parker at Napster. And it's like, [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8270.800000000001s)]
*  Genie's out of the bag, bro. Like you can't control that. Like that's, I think they didn't [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8277.68s)]
*  have any idea what was coming, nor how could they. And so we really thought that that was just, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8283.28s)]
*  it's so difficult to see where like one invention goes. If it was just Napster and that was it for [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8288.64s)]
*  the end of time. Right. But it's the thing that never loses technology. There's no stopping it. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8293.52s)]
*  Right. And it's like, what do you, and so that's actually when the first time Sean Parker reached [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8298.72s)]
*  out to me and he's like, bro, I want to get a painting for you from you, but I'm being sued [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8302.88s)]
*  for a trillion dollars right now from like every single and you know, whatever they got out of [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8307.199999999999s)]
*  that. But I'm saying it had the Genie was out of the box, the Pandora's box, whatever. And, [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8311.92s)]
*  and so that was back then. Right. And now we live in an age where most kids don't pay. Like if I [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8317.199999999999s)]
*  wanted to listen to music, I had to take a risk and buy something at Tower Records, get a job [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8323.119999999999s)]
*  and then shit man, the single was good. And the rest of that, you know, like you had to risk, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8328.08s)]
*  but now because we have access to all the porn, all the documentaries, all the comedy, [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8332.0s)]
*  all the music, it's like in that way, everyone's wealthy. Right. Anybody can have access to [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8335.679999999998s)]
*  anything or find a way to steal it or have it with very low risk of getting caught. Right. Right. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8341.2s)]
*  And so people don't understand we have what's out AI for the consumers. Right. But some of the people [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8346.880000000001s)]
*  we know, like the shit is bonkers, dude. And I talked to Jamie about it. Like you will never [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8355.04s)]
*  fucking be able to believe, like I could come home and be like, AI suck my dick AI. I want to listen [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8361.2s)]
*  to Carpenter's, but I want iced tea to sing it. AI. My dad was like really shitty to me. Put him [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8368.48s)]
*  up a hologram, have him say all the apologies. I wish he said, but he never said AI Ozarks, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8374.56s)]
*  but all Asian change the ending to the sopranos deep fake. Like that's coming. That's here. It's [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8380.24s)]
*  not perfect yet. And so what does it do? It brings the temperature of the fear up, right? Like a lot [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8385.84s)]
*  of my friends have lost their jobs. A lot. If I, if I was still trying to sell art, I'd be fucking [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8392.32s)]
*  out of a job. Like AI paints way better than I do. And so what did Metallica have to do? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8397.76s)]
*  Tour. Right. ACDC stones, like 90 years old, still fucking touring. And so [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8405.2s)]
*  it's like what we were seeing again. That's here now. You could sign papers and shit to try to [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8412.48s)]
*  make that go away. That's a fucking insane monster that's here now. And of course we would love it [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8417.6s)]
*  if it was best case scenario and it was here to aid humanity and do all that. But we've seen [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8424.96s)]
*  enough terminators, like the things it's a human that made that right. So it's going to probably be [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8430.64s)]
*  really racist. It's probably going to be super sexist. It's probably going to be like psychopathic. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8437.439999999999s)]
*  It's probably going to. And so I go, I could go to fear. I could go to hate or I could go to acceptance, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8442.4s)]
*  adapting and our religion of love. And so whatever that, whatever, like that's a gift. If you're [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8450.16s)]
*  like working at a job and you're like, wow, AI is self-driving car now. I've done out of my truck [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8457.28s)]
*  driving job or I've learned my whole life how to like edit sound. And now that's done. Like all that [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8461.92s)]
*  it's almost like freeing you to be the whatever is coming next. And so whatever your version of [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8468.24s)]
*  touring is, right? Which is the third space again, it's human connection. Like you can't make, [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8476.56s)]
*  if you're, forget Metallica, if you're like a new band, most people aren't buying CDs, tapes, [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8482.24s)]
*  records. So you have to sell merch. You have to go out, you have to perform, you have to meet people. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8487.119999999999s)]
*  You have to have connection. So whatever that version of that is for you as a human, no more like, [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8492.08s)]
*  like you're going to have to move away from technology and more to human connection. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8498.32s)]
*  That's my belief on it because it's fucking scary as shit and I could choose to live in fear and be [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8502.8s)]
*  scared or like, like people are losing their livelihoods that they spent their life on. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8509.44s)]
*  Yeah, that, that aspect of it is terrifying because people aren't stable financially enough [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8515.84s)]
*  to deal with the entire industry going away. I fired my lawyer. Like I asked chat GPT, like [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8521.92s)]
*  my lawyer costs 600 bucks every time I pick up the phone and I was like, as a test, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8528.24s)]
*  like here's the questions and you know, I always got to do 10 minutes of small talk. I'm like, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8533.36s)]
*  that's a hundred bucks right there. You know, I don't care about your kids, dude. Just tell me, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8536.88s)]
*  tell me what I want to know. So he gave me a very similar answer than the chat GPT. I'm like, [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8541.199999999999s)]
*  that's a phone call. I'm never going to have to make again. Boom, done. The guy that does like, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8546.16s)]
*  you know, but now that guy's free to pursue the next chapter of his life, you know, whatever. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8552.32s)]
*  If something's available, the problem is what, what, you know, people like Andrew Yang were [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8558.4s)]
*  worried about was this mass disruption of our economy where automated things and things done [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8563.68s)]
*  through AI remove most jobs. And so we have this abundance of wealth that's available to things [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8568.64s)]
*  like the war in Ukraine and some other stuff. Like we need to consider something like a universal [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8576.72s)]
*  basic income. So, and it's not saying that just for people to never work, you don't have to work. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8582.08s)]
*  We'll just give you money. That's not what it is. It's like, you have to be figure out a way to [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8587.28s)]
*  give people enough money to survive if everything goes away because everything might go away. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8590.880000000001s)]
*  That's, that's where it's sketchy. And what's really sketchy is what we might be doing is making [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8596.480000000001s)]
*  a new life form. And I've said this before, but I'll say it again. I think we're an electronic [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8602.880000000001s)]

*  I think there's going to be a transitionary period where people are cyborgs and they integrate with [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8613.44s)]
*  technology and it becomes mandatory because we put it, because everybody does it just like [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=8618.560000000001s)]

*  And I know a lot of people have concerns about AI art. And I get where they're coming from, [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9236.24s)]
*  particularly with taking jobs away from illustrators. And it's going to be a problem [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9240.4s)]
*  if it's not already a problem. It is a problem. There's a thing. I'm sure it's a problem. I don't [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9244.88s)]
*  know why I'm hedging that. But there's a thing that people really love about. I love things that [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9248.8s)]
*  someone made. Like to me, that's fucking giant. That means everything to me. Right. Like this [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9254.4s)]
*  thing, this is by this guy, Shane against the machine. And this is a chimpanzee skull that's [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9259.279999999999s)]
*  made from Zildjian symbols. I fucking love this thing. Right. This guy makes shit. Like you go [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9267.119999999999s)]
*  to his Instagram page and he's made the texture of the symbol. You couldn't, if you did that with [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9273.6s)]
*  a 3D printer wouldn't mean anything. It would still be dope. Like if someone gave me that and [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9278.0s)]
*  it was 3D printed, I'd still think it was dope. Right. But knowing that a guy made it, it's way [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9282.880000000001s)]
*  more dope. And that's what we're moving towards is. I don't think you and I are. And I think as long [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9286.720000000001s)]
*  as we can express the value. No, I'm saying we're moving towards you're going to have to make stuff [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9292.56s)]
*  by like, yes, it's going to be less. It will mean more. It'll mean more. It means more. It's real. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9296.640000000001s)]
*  This is this guy's version of like Metallica. Like you have to. Exactly. You could mass produce [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9302.0s)]
*  shit, but that's going to have less value to someone like me. It's a giant thing in the world [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9308.0s)]
*  of pool cues. In the world of pool cues, there's computer made pool cues where they're made on this [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9313.76s)]
*  lathe and it doesn't ever fuck up. And it's really, in those pool cues is just about design. Right. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9320.72s)]
*  And just beautiful execution. But in the world of handmade pool cues, there's some motherfuckers [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9325.36s)]
*  that are like cutting. Right. There's this guy named, well, my buddy, John Showman's one of the [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9330.32s)]
*  best examples. He makes pool cues where they are cutting these points into this wood and they have [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9335.68s)]
*  all these layers of wood and it's a big block and they spin it on a lathe until it becomes the [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9342.72s)]
*  perfect diameter. And they make sure the wood has a good harmonic sound to it. They like dunk it on [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9348.16s)]
*  the concrete to get a sound. My friend, Eric Crisp, he takes every shaft and he dinks, he listens [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9354.24s)]
*  to the sound that it makes when it bounces off the cement. He wants to know they have the right [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9360.8s)]
*  harmony and that the woods, the harmony of the woods go together. So the artisanal pool cue guy [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9365.28s)]
*  is like how many of those are in the world? There's quite a few. There is? Yeah. I mean, [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9372.96s)]
*  not in compared to like how many lawyers there are. Right. I mean, there's, but there's dozens. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9378.72s)]
*  There's dozens all over the world. And there's a lot in Japan too. There's this one company called [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9383.04s)]
*  Zen Cues out of Japan that's doing fucking phenomenal stuff, like super artistic shit [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9387.6s)]
*  on pool cues. But the rate at which, you know, like I started earlier with you today talking about [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9393.04s)]
*  like how I figured out the money game or the thing. Like the AI can figure that out in two [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9400.160000000002s)]
*  seconds, right? Like it could catfish the shit out of anyone. So in that same way, it will figure out [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9404.0s)]
*  how to make imperfect stuff to give it a handmade look. No, no. I honestly think. So then the value [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9409.6s)]
*  will be in the documentation of it. Yeah. So here's, there's a, go to North Demon Cues. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9416.56s)]
*  There's this guy in China that makes these fucking beautiful pool cues. And he documents a lot of [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9422.48s)]
*  the construction of it on these tiny little things that he's inlaying in there with silver [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9429.76s)]
*  and copper. And he's setting it all. Look at this fucking gorgeous work, man. This guy's doing this. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9435.36s)]
*  I mean, there's photos of his lab where he puts all this stuff together, but his cues are fucking [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9441.76s)]
*  gorgeous. Beautiful. They're works of art and they play really good too. It's like crazy combination [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9447.36s)]
*  because you can't just have that. It has to be balanced. It has to have a feel when you drive [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9453.04s)]
*  through the ball and you can make amazing stuff with computers. You can make amazing stuff with [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9458.960000000001s)]
*  machines, but you're not going to feel it in your hand and know that a man on the other side of the [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9464.08s)]
*  world constructed this. And he did it in his, it is his workshop and he did it with machines, [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9469.6s)]
*  like sanding things and sawing things and lining it up perfectly. Right. So someone who's in the [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9475.76s)]
*  position of like, that's my passion or my hobby. I love making handmade pool cues, but that doesn't [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9482.4s)]
*  really pay the bills. So I'm going to go towards law school. Like now that your job is taken away, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9487.68s)]
*  it's going to push this. This is what I, one theory that could happen or one path. Let me just [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9492.88s)]
*  stop you right there. Because the world of pool cues, those guys have like a three year waiting [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9497.199999999999s)]
*  list. That's what some of them have a 10 to Southwest cues might have a 16 year waiting list, [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9500.72s)]
*  but that's like with any specialty thing, right? The guy who hand makes knives or jackets or [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9505.439999999999s)]
*  whatever. Like they all, like the ones that are the best will always have a, but like if you're out [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9510.0s)]
*  there right now and you're like, fuck, I gotta, if, if this is moving towards cyborg God level [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9515.359999999999s)]
*  and it's not evil and it's not trying to kill us and it does make the world a better place where [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9521.2s)]
*  it's like 3d printing houses for everyone and figuring out how to grow its own food. And you [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9526.720000000001s)]
*  don't actually need to make that much money because it's like providing for you. Then you're going to [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9531.84s)]
*  have to figure out how to like be a person and live with and like, you know, have a Jamie or [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9536.0s)]
*  have friends and you know, more human experiences instead of just living online all the time. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9541.2s)]
*  My legitimate concern is we're going to be amongst the last of the people. That's my legitimate [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9546.16s)]
*  concern. My legitimate concern is we, the, the idea that we would never be here is so outside [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9552.48s)]
*  the realm of possibility that we don't even think about it. But I think if you think about all the [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9559.2s)]
*  other planets that don't have any life and the idea that this one life is going to prevail, why? Just [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9564.16s)]
*  cause it's awesome. We're awesome. Like I don't believe that. And whether it's by nuclear disaster, [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9568.08s)]
*  you know, whether it's war, nuclear war, whether it's some horrific natural disaster, whatever it [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9574.32s)]
*  is, it easily could happen. And the idea that it wouldn't, but the, this thing that we create, [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9580.88s)]
*  if we create this thing and this thing figures out the possibilities of these things happening [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9586.64s)]
*  and also figures out asteroids that are coming that we aren't aware of because we don't have the [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9591.6s)]
*  capability, but it does. So it figures out a better way to detect asteroids and a better way [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9597.6s)]
*  to deflect them and then can protect the earth and make sure that at least that aspect of the [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9602.0s)]
*  natural disaster problem chart is going to be solved. Right. Okay. Now we know we have an iron [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9607.04s)]
*  shield, like, you know, like Jerusalem has, right? Like we have an iron shield over the earth and no [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9612.56s)]
*  asteroids ever going to fuck us up. So now we've got to deal with super volcanoes. Maybe AI can do [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9618.32s)]
*  that. Maybe AI can say, you know what, if we just drill in from under the ocean in this direction, [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9621.84s)]
*  we can leave some of the pressure by having the lava go into the ocean and then it'll stop this [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9626.8s)]
*  idea of having a fucking caldera super volcano that wipes out everything on the continent. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9631.04s)]
*  Cause those happen all the time too. Those happen every, you know, whatever, million years or so. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9635.68s)]
*  So are you scared? You're, I mean, not scared. I'm in acknowledgement of the, the, just the full [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9639.44s)]
*  scope of possibilities, but I'm also acutely aware that I have a desire to think that everything's [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9647.2s)]
*  going to be okay because I'm okay right now. And I think everybody has that feeling. I think that's [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9652.960000000001s)]
*  a human feeling. And that's why you don't think about things like asteroid impacts. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9656.72s)]
*  But if we play out what you just said, if, if, if, if we buy in that this is it, like we're the last [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9660.8s)]
*  of the, this. We might not be, we might not. But let's just say it is. Yeah. Then what should we [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9666.4s)]
*  be doing with our time? Nothing. Just enjoy your life. There's not a goddamn thing you're going to [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9671.439999999999s)]
*  be able to do to stop the progression. Party up in here. It's like stopping the rain. You're [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9677.039999999999s)]
*  not going to stop the rain. Once it starts raining, you know, it's not, you're not stopping it. It's [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9680.88s)]
*  the, it'll stop on its own. It's the dudes playing their instruments as the Titanic is sinking. It's [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9684.64s)]
*  like, if it's happening, you could panic and try to get to Mars or in the lifeboat or whatever, [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9689.84s)]
*  or you could just be like, it's here. It's just one of many possibilities. There's other [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9695.119999999999s)]
*  possibilities too. One of them might be that we embrace psychedelics and we change culture and, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9699.92s)]
*  and human beings start behaving in a way that's more consistent with what we would like to see [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9704.64s)]
*  from an advanced civilization. I just had a Rick Doblin on my, I did too. I just had him on too. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9709.6s)]
*  He's awesome. This mic smells like Rick Doblin. That guy. He's the best. He's, he's been in the [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9715.76s)]
*  trenches for decades. Hearing him say that he decided to get into psychedelic therapy when he [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9721.12s)]
*  was like 18, 19 years old. Like, how did you, how did, it wasn't even legal back then, but this guy's [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9727.92s)]
*  been on that grind forever. So the only like, like, I don't fucking know shit about NFTs, but like I [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9733.6s)]
*  made one and just for, it was, it's like buying a painting where I paint over like 20 times. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9739.2s)]
*  Right. And I donated all that to, to maps and like, that's awesome. Like Rick, like psychedelics saved [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9744.320000000002s)]
*  my life. It's like connected me to like a part of myself I would never get to through Western [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9750.08s)]
*  therapy or whatever. So I've, I've known Rick for a while, you know, we talk here and there [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9756.320000000002s)]
*  and I said, Hey, I have a show called the Cho Show. You want to come on? And he came in and like, [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9761.36s)]
*  because he's been in the trenches, cause he's this close to getting it. He went into like kind of [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9766.08s)]
*  politician mode and like, bro, like you could do that on any other show. Like, yeah. What's the, [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9770.32s)]
*  like the most intimate thing we can do? Like I'm not trying to fuck you or anything like that. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9775.76s)]
*  Settle down. And, and I said, you know, a lot of people, like for me, the most intimate thing you [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9779.68s)]
*  can do with someone is like touch their face. Like, you know, so, so we touched each other's faces for [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9787.12s)]
*  like 20 minutes and then the rest, he's an MDMA guy. That's normal. If you're tripping, I didn't [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9792.0s)]
*  have to, you know, he's like, let's do it. So he touched my face and I closed my eyes and I was [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9797.44s)]
*  like, this guy and like, I had a, like you could say it's bullshit. I had a deeper conversation [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9801.68s)]
*  doing that than if we actually exchanged words. So we touched our face for a long time. And then [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9808.32s)]
*  when he started talking to me and look, like I, I want to have fun. Like show me how to have fun. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9814.0s)]
*  Like it's just life just grinds you down. And it's all about, you know, people say that the journey [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9822.88s)]
*  from your head to the heart is the longest journey you'll take in your life. And it's been true for [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9828.4s)]
*  me because everything is like people apply way too much logic, right? They're like, how come, what [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9831.92s)]
*  the fuck's that? Like, like the stats, it doesn't match up. That doesn't make it. I'm like feeling [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9838.08s)]
*  we're so far from feeling. So I just wanted, I was like, I have you on Rick. I want to feel you. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9843.12s)]
*  He touched my face. I touched his face. And then we just talked in gibberish for like an hour. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9848.160000000002s)]
*  Like, and like I, you could say we're silly goofing off, which that's part of it, but it's like [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9852.320000000002s)]
*  in the times where words have failed me, like I can never like fully, I always feel that I can [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9859.68s)]
*  sometimes get closer when I paint or do something like where I express my art, but like talking is, [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9864.880000000001s)]
*  has limited me in times. And so for me to talk to him in like, [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9870.8s)]
*  Huttese or tongues or some weird shit that just came out of me and just came, I mean, [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9874.8s)]
*  that guy's the master. And I just felt like so connected to him in that moment. And I was like, [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9879.12s)]
*  I was like, what else is there to say? You know? Yeah, no, that guy's so valuable. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9885.12s)]
*  He's the best. His work is so valuable. He's the, he's the, he's the man. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9888.8s)]
*  What I was saying earlier, I didn't mean that like somehow or that's going to stop the inevitable, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9892.8s)]
*  that if we embrace psychedelics, but I do think it would be, it'd be very beneficial if we did it [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9897.44s)]
*  in a, in a way where people who understood how to do it, we're administrating it to more people, [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9903.2s)]
*  not for everybody. I'm not saying it's for everybody, but it's for a lot of people. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9908.640000000001s)]
*  Well, the thing they say, [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9912.0s)]
*  what I think is even if we do that, we're still faced with this fucking real crisis [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9912.720000000001s)]
*  of artificial intelligence. It's a real crisis because if it gets switched, if it goes to that [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9918.4s)]
*  thing does whatever it wants. We have zero to do. We have, we have nothing to say. We have, [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9925.52s)]
*  we are now the inferior species. We are 100% at the mercy of our robot overlords. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9930.960000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9938.08s)]
*  And that was, you know, Marshall McLuhan had a fucking amazing quote from the 1960s, [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9938.560000000001s)]
*  said human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. Isn't that amazing? [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9944.08s)]
*  It might be true. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9951.28s)]
*  McLuhan wrote that in like the sixties. I don't think a pair, am I paraphrasing that? I don't [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9952.48s)]
*  think I am. It sounds good. I think that's exactly how he said it, but like that is what we do, man. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9957.36s)]
*  And if that's what we do, like there's so many instances of that in nature where a thing becomes [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9963.52s)]
*  another thing. The caterpillar has no fucking idea what it's doing when it's making a cocoon. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9969.68s)]
*  It's just doing it. It doesn't have the cognitive ability to understand that it's making a [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9973.76s)]
*  protective air. At least we don't think it does. That's the ability to make a protective casing in [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9978.8s)]
*  which it's going to morph and change into a completely different thing with fucking wings. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9984.4s)]
*  I mean, that's- [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9989.92s)]
*  Then it's going to pop out of that thing and fly away like the most universally regarded as beautiful [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9990.4s)]
*  insect that we have. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9996.88s)]
*  So in the same way, like a weightlifting dude in the fifties would not recognize like a roided out, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=9997.92s)]
*  like modern super buff guy. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10003.119999999999s)]
*  That would be bad. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10005.279999999999s)]
*  We're not going to recognize what humans- [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10005.92s)]
*  Way more of a jump. Way more of a jump. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10008.0s)]
*  It'll be way more of a jump. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10009.28s)]
*  It might be a jump outside of the biological. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10010.960000000001s)]
*  Hey, when you get your wings and I get my wings, we're going to fly. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10013.6s)]
*  We're going to have a good time. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10015.6s)]
*  We're going to fly, bro. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10016.4s)]
*  We're probably going to fly without going anywhere. That's what's going to be really weird. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10017.12s)]
*  I think human beings are going to be able to do things that if we stop and think about it right [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10020.16s)]
*  now, seems ridiculous. I think we're going to be able to make contact with other life forms. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10026.48s)]
*  Here it goes. Man becomes, as it were, the sex organs of the machine world. [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10031.92s)]
*  As the bee of the plant world, enabling it to fecundate and evolve ever new forms. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10037.199999999999s)]
*  The machine world reciprocates man's love by expediting his wishes and desires, [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10044.24s)]
*  namely in providing him with wealth. That's from Understanding Media, 1964. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10050.8s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10056.16s)]
*  McLuhan was brilliant. Brilliant guy. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10057.279999999999s)]
*  But that quote, human beings are the machine world sex organs. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10059.599999999999s)]
*  It's such a nutty thing to think. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10066.64s)]
*  Man, it's in nature. It's in so many different forms of life where one form of life takes over [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10070.32s)]
*  another form of life and uses it to birth a new thing like aquatic worms that convince a grass [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10076.64s)]
*  hopper to jump into a pool and drown so that it can be born. You've seen those, right? [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10082.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10086.880000000001s)]
*  That shit exists all throughout nature. Maybe the lure of your phone. Oh, six hours a day. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10087.52s)]
*  What you just described right now is actually how I view you. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10092.56s)]
*  Oh, no. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10097.519999999999s)]
*  I also view myself that way, but you are not the same. People can see someone and see them [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10100.64s)]
*  physically, but when I see you and I say you're beautiful, I see your soul, which someone could [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10106.72s)]
*  be like, that's some hippie dippy shit, but I feel energies. You could use your words. I'm not an [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10111.76s)]
*  intellect scholar, whatever, so you could destroy me in a verbal thing or someone's smarter, but [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10120.16s)]
*  I'm always like, where are you coming from? What's your soul telling me? You're not the same person [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10125.84s)]
*  that you were 10 years ago, five minutes ago. I don't want to call it a parasite, but you're [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10131.68s)]
*  in touch with something that's created this newest form of Joe that I'm meeting today. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10141.44s)]
*  That's not the same guy I met 15 years ago. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10145.52s)]
*  It's just constant work. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10147.68s)]
*  Constant work and constant thinking. I spend a lot of time evaluating my thoughts. I spend a [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10149.759999999998s)]
*  lot of time evaluating why I think about things and what I'm thinking and whether or not I'm being [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10156.4s)]
*  influenced or whether or not I'm being egotistical or confused and why do I behave the way I behave? [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10163.679999999998s)]
*  What could I do better? I'm always thinking about it. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10170.72s)]
*  That's head stuff, right? You're already thinking about it, but then to do psychedelics, [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10174.96s)]
*  would you agree, like scent it even? [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10180.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, 100%. Changes everything. Marijuana first. Marijuana first changed it. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10181.68s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people that go through life without any perturbance of normal consciousness [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10187.12s)]
*  that are missing out on the possibilities of looking at yourself in a way that you can't do [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10193.12s)]
*  without a psychedelic, or I've never been able to do. Maybe you can do it with yoga or some [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10198.88s)]
*  forms of meditation. I don't want to say you can't do it, but I will say I've never done it. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10202.88s)]
*  I've never experienced the revelations that I've had about life through any other form other than [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10207.119999999999s)]
*  maybe ... There's love and childbirth and there's some pretty profound moments that seem very [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10214.4s)]
*  psychedelic in life. Childbirth seems very psychedelic. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10220.4s)]
*  That's the most surreal thing ever. [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10222.72s)]
*  You see a baby being born into the world and the love that you have is like you're on a drug. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10224.08s)]
*  It's so bizarre. It's so bizarrely psychedelic, but there's a bunch of those experiences that [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10228.8s)]
*  transcend us in the regular world. For some people it's a near-death experience. Some people it's [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10234.88s)]
*  coming back from something where they realize like, oh my God, I almost lost everything, [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10239.68s)]
*  and now I have a newfound love and appreciation for the world. But I think psychedelics do that [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10243.44s)]
*  without the harm. Even though you did ... You've done your own psychedelics. We've never done it [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10247.76s)]
*  together. No. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10252.72s)]
*  I've done it, but because you've done those things and I've done them, now we have a shared [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10253.52s)]
*  language when we meet where it's almost, to me, might not be for you, kind of telepathic. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10257.84s)]
*  And it's like, I've almost died multiple times. I have children. I've had all those amazing ... [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10264.08s)]
*  And you're right. Those create a euphoric drug-like and psychedelics surpasses that for me. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10271.04s)]
*  What's a different thing? It's a different thing because it's not in this material realm. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10278.4s)]
*  It's this thing of whatever that dimension of thought and beings and consciousness is. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10282.88s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but it doesn't exist here. So you can only take the information that [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10289.359999999999s)]
*  you get from that and bring it back to here. I think that's where a lot of people lose some of [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10293.84s)]
*  it. It's hard to take that. You take that experience and like, how do you apply some of that to your [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10298.72s)]
*  life without recognizing that the way you're living currently is not optimal? [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10304.48s)]
*  Can I tell you what one of those things was for me very recently? [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10311.199999999999s)]
*  Sure. Do you believe I have to pee again? [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10314.64s)]
*  Go pee. I'm peeing so much. This is preposterous. But I'll pee one more time and then we'll wrap [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10316.8s)]
*  this up. Okay. This is something when I watch it on YouTube or on Spotify, I don't see, but that [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10320.64s)]
*  painting of you, I always thought that line coming ... I thought it was like you had a rat tail, [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10327.119999999999s)]
*  Anakin Skywalker or something, and it's a broken wire. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10331.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the ear ruffs cords. Yeah. So let me tell you something. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10335.279999999999s)]
*  Going back to ... Aliens? [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10341.759999999998s)]
*  Aliens and God and the spirit world being funnier than any comedian I've ever met. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10343.679999999998s)]
*  That's hilarious. So what you're just telling me ... [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10350.16s)]
*  I want to tell people though, before you ... You did stand up and it was very funny. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10353.199999999999s)]
*  You did stand up, you only did it once and you did it like it was at UCLA, right? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10357.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I watched it. I watched the whole thing. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10361.599999999999s)]
*  I did it three times. I did it three times. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10364.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. I thought at that time, I think that was the first time you did it, right? [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10365.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. You were in the blue suit. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10369.439999999999s)]
*  Was it a blue suit? Red suit. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10370.72s)]
*  Red suit. That's right. Dude, it was very funny. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10371.599999999999s)]
*  Thank you. It was good. I was like, [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10373.84s)]
*  this guy could be a comic. Thank you. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10375.279999999999s)]
*  I remember I called you and I told you that. Wow. Yeah. Thank you so much. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10376.64s)]
*  You could do that. You're one of those weird fucking dudes, like Howard Stern, [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10380.08s)]
*  where you can start painting. But I think most of us are like that. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10384.0s)]
*  I just go all in. I know, but that ... You do, but that same reason ... I know I'm kind of joking [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10388.0s)]
*  with you. Why do you think that you could win fucking Survivor? Because there's other people [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10393.84s)]
*  like you out there. But I love the fact that you don't think there is. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10398.16s)]
*  Can you tell me if this is true? I heard that your new comedy club, which I can't wait to check out, [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10401.84s)]
*  you have to put your phone into that lock thing before you go in. Just hearing that, [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10407.119999999999s)]
*  when I did ... Yeah, there was cell phones the first time I did it, but to know that you could [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10414.08s)]
*  literally say anything- You can say anything. [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10419.84s)]
*  And it's not going to come- Come do a show. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10422.0s)]
*  Dude, it's- We'll put you in the little room. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10424.48s)]
*  You'll love the little room. The little room is the shit. It's the fucking most honest room in [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10426.96s)]
*  the world. 120 seats. It's fucking incredible. You're in there, you're like, wow. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10430.56s)]
*  Thinking about doing stand-up is probably the same reason why I still work out at the worst [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10435.199999999999s)]
*  24 hour fitness. This is what I'm trying to do to you. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10439.439999999999s)]
*  It's stressing me. I'm trying to get you to move to Austin, [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10440.96s)]
*  do Jiu-Jitsu, and do stand-up. What am I trying to do to him? [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10442.56s)]
*  But to go back before P-Break, the thing I wanted to say- [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10447.839999999998s)]
*  Aliens. Okay, so my life or my [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10450.96s)]
*  experience or my journey with psychedelics is 35 was the first time I ever did anything. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10456.56s)]
*  I'd never done drugs. Maybe I smoked weed once with BJ Penn before something, but I did it once. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10462.08s)]
*  He's like, you're not going to smoke with the champ, bro. [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10468.24s)]
*  And I'm like- You got to smoke with BJ. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10470.16s)]
*  Oh, man. That's like smoking with Snoop Dogg. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10472.24s)]
*  I took one hit of whatever, how powerful that shit was, and I couldn't move. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10474.48s)]
*  When did you meet BJ? I met BJ through Pat from Rooka [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10478.64s)]
*  20 years ago, maybe? So you met BJ when BJ was in his prime. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10485.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. BJ Penn is prime to this day. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10490.72s)]
*  I think there was a couple of years of BJ Penn that I would put up against. I would like to see [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10493.52s)]
*  him against anybody at 155 pounds that's ever lived. The prodigy. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10497.279999999999s)]
*  The prodigy. They only look at bad [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10500.48s)]
*  performances, and I said this to BJ when he was on the podcast. If you just look at the elite ones, [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10504.8s)]
*  he was so good. He was so good. And when he was really fit, when he was doing his strength [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10510.72s)]
*  and conditioning with the Marinoviches during the Sean Shirk fight and the Diego Sanchez fight, [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10516.48s)]
*  bro, BJ was a motherfucker. But I know you didn't like how I said Eddie [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10521.76s)]
*  Murphy should quit when he whatever. When I look at my friend like BJ Penn or someone like [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10527.039999999999s)]
*  Conor McGregor or Anderson Silk, people that just killed it, they just took it, elevated it from [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10532.24s)]
*  like. But why quit? Why quit? It's the most fun thing ever. This is what you don't understand. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10540.0s)]
*  Like that's the most fun thing to do. It's the most fun. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10543.68s)]
*  But losing is fun? It's not always losing. [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10548.480000000001s)]
*  But like at the end when they're- They keep thinking they're going to win. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10551.12s)]
*  Like me, I guess. Like Anderson Silva beat Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10554.16s)]
*  in a boxing match when he was like 46 years old. But like those last few that he got his ass rocked, [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10557.84s)]
*  it changes my image of like- Well, Anderson broke his leg. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10564.24s)]
*  Whatever. If he's having a great time, fuck it. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10567.52s)]
*  Do you know the story? No, I know. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10569.44s)]
*  Yeah. But when he broke that- His leg was broke, he was never the same again. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10570.960000000001s)]
*  Right. He was just not the same guy. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10575.12s)]
*  Right. And Weidman's KO of him also put a giant dent in him. I mean, that was a big KO. Weidman [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10576.32s)]
*  caught him with that left hook and just fucking clocked him. And so going from that and he's [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10581.76s)]
*  advanced age and he's older in his later 30s. I don't think he got to the UFC, he was 34. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10588.48s)]
*  Which for an elite combat sports athlete, that's like the very cusp, the top. I think Paeda, [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10594.96s)]
*  Alex Paeda came at the same sort of age bracket, like 34. I think he's 35 now. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10601.84s)]
*  I guess it comes down to value system of what- If you're still having a great time, [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10606.56s)]
*  but I'm talking about not just fighters, but anyone who's operating at a high, high wire act [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10611.52s)]
*  level, whether that's comedy, music, fighting, it's like no one's the goat forever. You're going to [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10617.119999999999s)]
*  fucking like- But it's not even about that. Just do your best. Do your best. And it's fun to do that. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10623.44s)]
*  Do your best, but if at some point people stop laughing, you're starting to lose. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10631.28s)]
*  Get better. Figure out what the fuck you lost. Stop being a bitch. What are you going to quit? [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10636.560000000001s)]
*  Go take naps? Let's go. Let's go, David Cho. Let's go. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10640.960000000001s)]
*  First of all, I take a lot of naps and it's not quit, it's pivot. It's adapt, right? You're going [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10645.2s)]
*  to stand here as AI comes out to you and you're like, no, I'm still the best. No, no, no. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10650.24s)]
*  We're talking about some insurmountable obstacle. We're not talking about someone's career that [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10654.0s)]
*  they've already flourished in. We're talking about an insurmountable obstacle. If you're talking [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10658.24s)]
*  about AI, you're talking about a life form and you're talking about probably the new dominant [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10661.84s)]
*  life form on earth. And probably that's probably how life gets designed in the cosmos. It probably [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10666.4s)]
*  recognizes at a certain point in time, the biological limitations of evolution in regards [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10673.119999999999s)]
*  to these multi-celled organisms. But if evolution can convince these multi-celled [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10678.96s)]
*  organisms to create something synthetic that's not dependent on blood or bone and maybe can [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10683.76s)]
*  live off solar energy or live off water, who knows? But if it can do that, if it can figure out that, [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10689.6s)]
*  then the game's over. Well, look, besides the very, very powerful one puff of BJ's weed that I [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10695.199999999999s)]
*  smoked, my drugs, I'm 46 now. So the last 11 years I've done mushrooms eight times. I did [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10702.32s)]
*  ayahuasca three times all in one week. That was the first time. And then very recently, once again, [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10708.64s)]
*  the comedian is back, God, alien, whatever you want to call him. And I was summoned by the guardians [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10714.72s)]
*  of the plant, Ayuboga from Gabon in Africa. I'd never done it. I was like, the last time I did [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10721.36s)]
*  ayahuasca, which was 35, the drug told me, the medicine told me, you're done. We've given you [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10727.12s)]
*  enough blueprint, enough instructions for you to do for the rest of your life. You don't need to [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10732.480000000001s)]
*  abuse us because you like to abuse things. And so I stayed off that. And then my friend called me, [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10736.08s)]
*  he's like, these guys that just are psychics that go around the world administering these [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10742.880000000001s)]
*  ayuboga ceremonies, it's the entire plant grinded up. And I was not ready. So I'm in a mental [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10749.6s)]
*  hospital because I just finished filming beef. I'm trying to go back to, like you said, I was very [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10756.96s)]
*  affected by emotions. I'm trying to get back to me, Dave, peaceful, loving Dave. And this guy's [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10761.919999999998s)]
*  calling me from Mexico City saying I've been summoned by the guardians of the plant. Sounds [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10769.519999999999s)]
*  like a movie. And I did the most powerful psych. I mean, I was high for four days where I would go [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10773.679999999998s)]
*  I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. Not recommended. It was way, way past what ayahuasca was. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10781.84s)]
*  And we have, all humans have operating system. If we're like fleshy computers, right? We're born and [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10793.6s)]
*  then you're taught what you're taught. And then you kind of, that's who I am. And that's kind of [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10798.880000000001s)]
*  stuck who you are for the rest of your life. And this thing just started making so many jokes at [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10802.800000000001s)]
*  me. Like, it's like, you have a living trust. You have a will, like all the things that like [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10809.36s)]
*  normal wealthy people do or whatever. It was just laughing at me. He's like, you have storage units [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10816.0s)]
*  full of what? And so I just, in that psycho psychedelic state, in that spiritual state, [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10823.36s)]
*  I was like, I have so many, I'm a hoarder because I'm my mom. I collect a lot of shit. I have comics. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10830.720000000001s)]
*  I have like rare painting. I have a lot of shit where I'm never going to sell it. And like the [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10836.16s)]
*  people, like when I die, like this is anyone who has a lot of shit, they're probably not going to [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10841.84s)]
*  know. Like I have a lot of stuff that's worth a lot to me because of the sentimental value and then [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10846.8s)]
*  things that are just actually worth a lot of money. And the thing was like, why don't you just give [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10851.68s)]
*  it away to the people who want it while you're alive? And I was like, oh fuck. And kind of like [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10856.16s)]
*  teasing me. And this is like seven months ago. So I've given away like 90% of my personal possessions. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10864.0s)]
*  And like there's some kid right now wearing, like I don't know why I still have my prom suit that I [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10871.84s)]
*  lost my virginity in like 1992. Like congratulations. Yeah. Thank you. So he has that. But in my mind, [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10876.64s)]
*  my ego goes, when I die and there's a Dave Cho museum, maybe there'll be like a thing of like [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10883.76s)]
*  all my crazy clothes I wore. And I'm like, I'm going to give this to someone. Can you imagine [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10887.6s)]
*  someone going to a museum of your life? Well, like Hard Rock Cafe, right? There's Prince's [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10891.76s)]
*  guitar. That's like everybody. It's like every band. You know, Freddie Mercury's mustache comb. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10896.24s)]
*  Right. You know, but imagine your own. And so like I had like a very transformative, I'm not going to [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10901.84s)]
*  do a good job if I'm trying to explain to you what happened. But I know that most people will never [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10909.6s)]
*  do like that level of psychedelic. But I know like a lot of shamans, they don't even do Iowaska or [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10914.4s)]
*  whatever, because they're so in touch with the nature and stuff. So I'm going to save a lot of [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10921.6s)]
*  people money right now. In all my fucked upness in all the rehabs, all the this is a common thing [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10926.640000000001s)]
*  at like a super expensive rehab is there's a thing called TRE, Trauma Release Exercise. And I did [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10932.24s)]
*  this in Arizona with this guy, Toruno. And from what he tells me, humans and domesticated dogs [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10939.28s)]
*  are the only animals on the planet that after they experience any kind of trauma, [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10947.92s)]
*  carry it in their body for the rest of their lives. So you have a cheetah chasing like a gazelle and [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10952.4s)]
*  getting this close, like scratching its butt. Like if that was a human, you're like, bro, [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10959.76s)]
*  I almost got killed by a fuck, you know? But then you see the gazelle like a minute later, [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10965.52s)]
*  go sip some water in a lake and the butt's doing a little like it's shaking that insanity out. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10970.16s)]
*  Oh, and then it's like it never happened again. But if we're whatever, this is what's taught to me [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10976.16s)]
*  and to me in my situation, it was true. If you've had like any kind of trauma, you just carry that [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10982.0s)]
*  it's it creates stress, anxiety, addiction, all these things. And so a very common thing, [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10988.56s)]
*  and I'm giving this secret away is you go to like an expensive rehab, and they give you a tennis [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10993.84s)]
*  racket or a baseball bat, and then you hit a pillow or a dummy. And you get that out, you do this [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=10998.8s)]
*  TRE trauma release exercise. And you're like, you know, if you're a fighter or a boxer, you get to [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11003.92s)]
*  get it out in other ways. But most, I would say most people have never been in a fist fight or [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11009.84s)]
*  like bash someone's head with a baseball bat or, you know, so to just get the motion, the feeling [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11015.44s)]
*  of hitting a dummy, I'm like, and these places are expensive. So me as an artist, I go, why not make [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11020.64s)]
*  a mannequin that looks exactly like my abuser? And, and, or, or take it one step further. I'm [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11028.08s)]
*  like, can I just hit a person like that's wearing pads? And they're like, Dave, this is like a [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11033.52s)]
*  business, like there's lawsuits and liabilities. And I go, Oh, well, you could do that because, [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11037.68s)]
*  or you can't do that because you're a professional, but I'm an artist, so I have artistic license. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11044.08s)]
*  So a few years ago, this is before you left LA. You know, this was the worst business decision [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11048.56s)]
*  for me because it cost millions of dollars. And this is what a normal art show is now like, [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11055.84s)]
*  right? Like, like a line waiting Banksy, whoever, Damien Hirst, and then everyone comes in, takes a [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11060.4s)]
*  selfie, they don't give a shit about the art. And then they just post like, I was there, right? [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11066.0s)]
*  And so that same side to me, well, there's a part of me that's like, well, I want to get more [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11070.0s)]
*  likes and more whatever. But so in a way, it ended up being the best decision that I've business [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11076.880000000001s)]
*  decision ever made because I had a show in an office building where I rented out this entire [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11082.72s)]
*  office building in each room. I had a, I'm trying to re basically steal everything that I learned [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11088.08s)]
*  in all these rehabs and re contextualize it in like, in an artistic way. Like most people have [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11094.96s)]
*  never screamed their lungs out, right? And there's movies where you go scream at the ocean. I had one [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11100.56s)]
*  where you walk in a room. This is just like, I'll give you like two of them. You walk in a room [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11105.519999999999s)]
*  and there's a punk band where the lead singer just OD'd as soon as you walk in. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11110.96s)]
*  And then they grab you and they go, you need to finish the song. And the song is like written [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11114.64s)]
*  out on the wall. I spray painted the lyrics. It's like, I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11120.32s)]
*  motherfucking best. And they make you keep screaming it. And then you get to be the lead singer of a, [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11123.759999999998s)]
*  of this. And that's just one room, right? And then you go in another room and it's covered with [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11128.88s)]
*  sculptures, like all these found object sculptures I made, but I'm doing the fucking thing that I [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11134.16s)]
*  said, I'm not a magician. There's a guy in there and he knows everything about you or not everything, [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11140.960000000001s)]
*  but you know, you fill out an application. So he knows like what's bothering you, what causes you [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11148.960000000001s)]
*  the most stress. And he goes up to you and he says, Hey Joe, I know you're having some problems right [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11153.6s)]
*  now at home or whatever your issue is. And he goes, I invite you to take that out on me. And [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11158.48s)]
*  you're like, what? And you give you a huge bat and you just beat the shit out of this guy. And the [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11164.32s)]
*  harder you beat him, he starts laughing and says, take, give me all of it. And you know, he's fully [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11170.0s)]
*  protected with police armor, right? But then I made it artistic, you know? So you literally get to beat [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11174.88s)]
*  the shit out of a human. And then I was like, do you have to use the bat? I mean, the people lost [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11180.4s)]
*  their mind. They were started punching, kicking. You can do that. No rules, dude. I'm not a fucking, [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11184.88s)]
*  like I'm not a legit business. And then we took it on the road. I was like, Hey, go to the park [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11190.0s)]
*  across the street. So the guy in the living sculpture goes across the street. And I had a guy [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11194.48s)]
*  with a bat and I'm like, anyone who has some shit they want to get off their chest, like a lady's [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11199.199999999999s)]
*  hitting this guy with the back. What is this? I need to give me my child support. Give me my fucking [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11204.32s)]
*  child support. What does this suit look like? It's all the police stuff that it could take the impact. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11208.56s)]
*  And then I did like a sculpture on top of it. So parts of the sculpture are like breaking off, [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11217.279999999999s)]
*  but underneath he's protected, right? Jesus Christ. But from a bat? Yeah. Was the person [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11222.08s)]
*  hitting him in the head? He had it fully neck, fully this. And we told them, don't hit the, [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11227.76s)]
*  like what we learned the hard way. Like he got one right here. But I was asking, but like, [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11235.359999999999s)]
*  but your head's going to get rattled no matter what, just from the impact. But the, you know, [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11240.48s)]
*  and this is four years ago, I did this and I'm like, like the show, like I just explained two [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11244.24s)]
*  things that happened at the show and there was like hundreds of rooms. So this thing cost me [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11252.4s)]
*  millions of dollars and it was so impactful for me. Forget like, you know, like the difference [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11256.56s)]
*  between like, oh, I have a million people that went through my show and took a selfie to like, [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11263.44s)]
*  I got to connect with people. I got to share. And so look, I mean, you told me this on the last time [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11267.36s)]
*  I saw you, which is like, Dave, you should start a Patreon or do some shit. And I was like, nah, [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11273.84s)]
*  I'm like, what I've learned about myself, about accountability is in the last 10 years, I've given [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11277.92s)]
*  my art away for free and people don't appreciate free. There has to be some skin in the game, [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11284.720000000001s)]
*  right? Like when I give away like, like a thousand dollar prints for free, they go immediately, [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11290.88s)]
*  like it must not be good, right? But the second I charge money, they're like, oh, so like you, [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11296.16s)]
*  you tell me where I should go with this. Cause I, I'm, I just started the YouTube channel, [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11302.72s)]
*  like very recently because I'm like, I'm like, I'm doing like wacky shit, dude. I'm just like [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11307.039999999999s)]
*  talking to my inner child. I'm just like- On YouTube? Yeah. You know your inner child's [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11316.0s)]
*  not on YouTube. I know. It's like, I'm doing like, I'll do a, I'll do a, like a guided meditation on [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11320.88s)]
*  like- Oh, that's cool. And then I'm like, but that didn't speak to me. I want to do a guided [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11328.4s)]
*  meditation as Wolverine, as Batman. And then I'll put that shit up on. So- Just whatever you feel [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11332.8s)]
*  like, just whatever I feel like. And then because through just all the experiments I've done, like [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11339.68s)]
*  that experience, the Cho-Show in the building was free. I made my TV show. I have, if you, [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11345.68s)]
*  if you go to the Cho-Show now, I have a paid thing now of people. It's like, I don't even know if I [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11351.92s)]
*  really want to do it, but I want some accountability from people, right? Like when things are free, [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11361.2s)]
*  everything's like, oh, whatever. But when you have some skin in the game, at least that's how I [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11367.76s)]
*  operate. That's always been the case with comedy clubs. Like whenever they give away the tickets [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11372.56s)]
*  for free, it's always a disaster. It's never good. Like you want people to be there because [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11376.4s)]
*  it's worth something to them. It's an exchange. So this is the, the first thing was the Cho-Show [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11381.92s)]
*  where they're like, it wasn't, it was like, I could only get like a hundred people through a day [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11388.56s)]
*  because it's such a intense experience for each person. And that was fulfilling for me. But if [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11394.4s)]
*  I'm trying to meet people where they're at in the third space and that's online, it's like, how can I, [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11400.4s)]
*  how can I, how can I teach people everything that I've learned? Because it's such a weird thing. It's [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11406.16s)]
*  such a weird feeling for me to go to a place that costs a hundred thousand a month. And I'm like, [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11413.199999999999s)]
*  what did I really learn there? They just taught me how to feel again. They re did my operating [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11417.76s)]
*  system. And I'm like this, and then like with my kids now and any kid now, you go to school to [[03:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11422.8s)]
*  learn two plus two or all the shit that the AI is going to do anyways. And they don't teach you like [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11428.48s)]
*  how to like get in touch with your emotions or like express yourself in like, like all those like very [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11433.76s)]
*  simple things. So we kind of grow up robots, like these like unfeeling robots, like college, [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11439.6s)]
*  get married, have a kid. Well we grow up in a way that facilitates us getting a good job. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11445.84s)]
*  So like my life right now, pre like everything I just told you about is just, it's dad life. I'm [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11450.72s)]
*  chilling. Like I just, I spend a lot of time with my kids. I'm chilling, but now I like had a taste [[03:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11456.8s)]
*  of acting. I'm like, I have like the YouTube thing. So I'm, I want to make sure you went, you acted [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11462.56s)]
*  and you wound up in a fucking mental institution. I checked myself. I checked myself. You wound up [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11471.92s)]
*  in a mental institution. One, I didn't say someone dragged you there, right? But you would want to go [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11477.439999999999s)]
*  back to doing that. If it was that seems to me, Batman, Wolverine, White Chicks 2, Heat 2. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11483.28s)]
*  Well, actually I have this show's not even out yet, or it might be out when, but like people [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11494.08s)]
*  already hitting me up. They're like, you're a scene stealer. They're saying this shit. And so I got a [[03:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11500.320000000002s)]
*  part in the new Batman as the Joker and I'm calling myself the choker because I'm the choster and [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11505.68s)]
*  the audition person is really, really fucking rough and they keep having me come back because [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11513.28s)]
*  my fucking daughter, dude, I'm like sitting there going all day. I play Batman all day. I play [[03:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11518.08s)]
*  Wolverine all day. I do this shit and it's fun. I don't know if I'd have fun. Like on a set, like, [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11523.04s)]
*  you know, cut, chop his head off again, cut, the fun thing is seeing the product, right? That's [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11528.640000000001s)]
*  what's fun about it. I think I already got your answer. You're like, fuck acting. So I think, [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11534.800000000001s)]
*  I think I'm done. I get it for some people. It's just like, look, some like Jamie likes golf. I've [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11538.72s)]
*  never played golf. You know what I'm saying? It's like that kind of thing. There's a lot of great [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11544.24s)]
*  things out there. You just can't do more than you're already doing if you're full and I'm full of [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11547.279999999999s)]
*  stuff to do. I don't have any more stuff to do. I have no room for other stuff. I'm not interested. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11552.88s)]
*  I like watching other stuff. Doesn't mean I don't like it. Just I'm not doing it. I don't have the [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11558.72s)]
*  time. I guess I'm not, I guess I'm pretty full like my kids and like that life is, but there's [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11563.84s)]
*  still part of me that feels I learned some shit. Yeah. And I feel like I want to maybe share those [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11571.92s)]
*  things. Like I would love to never podcast again. I love talking to you, but like there's a part of [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11579.92s)]
*  me that feels even hoarder ish when I learned something that can help someone and I keep it [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11584.8s)]
*  to myself. Like I've learned a lot of shit. I mean, when a kid asked me today, like how do I [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11589.44s)]
*  make it in the art business? I'm like that I don't know because anything I made it as an illustrator, [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11593.92s)]
*  as a graffiti art, like none of that stuff's relevant anymore. But the stuff that has to do [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11598.880000000001s)]
*  with fun feeling again, like, I mean, dude, sorry if I told the story again, but there's an art barn [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11603.12s)]
*  at most rehabs because most of these guys are like strung up, they like are CEOs, whatever. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11612.56s)]
*  So the one that I went to was like a hundred grand a month. So there's a lot of multimillionaires, [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11618.32s)]
*  billionaires there and there's an art barn. And I'm like, fuck yeah, that's where I'm going to [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11623.039999999999s)]
*  escape. And like, you know, and they're like, not for you. I'm like, what? I can't go in there. And [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11627.359999999999s)]
*  they're like, no, that's where you like, you know, that's how you get high. So you're going to go do [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11631.68s)]
*  something else. And I'm like, fuck. But I would always sneak in and try to like whatever. So [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11636.24s)]
*  there's a dude in there and I'm not going to say who he is, but he's like probably one of the most [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11642.0s)]
*  powerful people on the planet. He could buy like a thousand or a billion of these rehabs and like, [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11645.92s)]
*  just, and, and so the assignment is to like draw like your favorite, like food, like, you know, [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11650.64s)]
*  something from your childhood using these acrylic paints. But on the next level is the glitter [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11660.0s)]
*  paints. Right. And I see this guy holding his hand and I go by the art barn. I'm like looking [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11665.12s)]
*  in the window like jealous. I want to be in there. And I go, one of the most richest powerful men in [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11670.24s)]
*  the planet is asking permission right now if he can use the glitter paint. And I go, that's it. [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11676.8s)]
*  Cause my kids don't ask for permission. Right. My kid will go into my closet and put on every single [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11688.24s)]
*  piece of clothes and come back. And I'm like, I'm going to do that. When's the last time I did that? [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11693.28s)]
*  Eight, seven years old. And I go and I put on like all my underwear, like, and I just, we have, [[03:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11698.8s)]
*  and then I roll down the stairs and I go permission granted. Like people really don't, [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11704.0s)]
*  they forgot how to have fun. They forgot how to like be goofy. But if you're like some CEO guy, [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11711.199999999999s)]
*  maybe he wants that. He wants to ask permission for things. Seemed like the same way. Some of [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11716.08s)]
*  those guys want to get kicked in the balls by a dominatrix. Right. Some of those guys, they like, [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11720.96s)]
*  it's like you were saying, you had so much pussy, you almost wanted to suck a dick. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11726.64s)]
*  Like some of those guys have so much power. They want someone to yell at them and humiliate them. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11729.76s)]
*  They've become tyrants. They've become kings. They've become a master of their domain and it [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11733.92s)]
*  feels imbalanced to them probably. And that's probably why they seek out getting humiliated. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11739.84s)]
*  But you walk this, you, so like, you know, Elon Musk, I mean, you walk, like, [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11744.64s)]
*  I feel like we're similar in that way. Like I can go work out at the worst 24 hour fitness and then [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11749.199999999999s)]
*  also be in rooms with those people. The rich and the poor are not that different mentally, I find. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11754.32s)]
*  Your mentality changes with the lack of fear of not having any money. Yeah. You know, and some [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11760.96s)]
*  people it doesn't. Some people, they always think about how they used to be poor and they can never [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11766.8s)]
*  get over the anxiety of the possibility of going back to being poor. So they just go on like a mad [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11771.36s)]
*  dash to having a fucking heart attack. And, you know, and other people settle in. That was me. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11776.08s)]
*  You seem settled in now though. I think I'm pretty settled in too. I'm settled in. I think I have, [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11780.4s)]
*  I gotta wrap this up my brother. Yeah, no worries. It's almost 5 p.m. So acting done. Yeah. And then [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11785.52s)]
*  YouTube channel, thumbs up or thumbs down. Yeah, I like it. Yeah, I want you to do whatever you [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11792.4s)]

*  be chaos. And then podcasting. And also like it'll grow and evolve too. Like if you do a YouTube [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11799.52s)]
*  channel, you'll, you're a very analytical guy. You'll look at it and decide, oh, now I want to try [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11804.24s)]
*  this. Now I'll try that. And then you have this platform now and you're developing the platform [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11808.96s)]
*  completely independently from other people's ideas. You can do whatever the fuck you want. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11812.64s)]
*  I just don't want to get devoured by work, right? You don't have to. So YouTube channel and then [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11816.48s)]
*  podcast, the Cho Show. Stay the fuck away from acting. And no more acting. Yep, there it is. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11820.64s)]
*  All right. Thank you, my brother. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. We are the Hotsa. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBArizQhDgk&t=11826.56s)]
