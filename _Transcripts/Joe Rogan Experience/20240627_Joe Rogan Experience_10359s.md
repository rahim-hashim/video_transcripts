# Joe Rogan Experience #1904 - Neil deGrasse Tyson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4)
*  I don't want to every one of my sentences to sound like Barry White. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=0.0s)]
*  Is that what it sounds like in your ears? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=16.0s)]
*  In headphones they do. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=17.0s)]
*  It's like, oh hey baby. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=18.0s)]
*  I just can't. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=20.0s)]
*  Whereas without the headphones I'm just regular. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  Alright ready? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Oh ready. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Hey. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  What's happening? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=29.56s)]
*  I'm excited to talk to you about a bunch of things but I've been paying attention to all [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=30.56s)]
*  the web telescope stuff. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=32.96s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=36.239999999999995s)]
*  It's all that. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=37.239999999999995s)]
*  Could you please explain the difference in the ability of the capabilities of this telescope [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  versus what we've had previously? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=43.28s)]
*  Yeah so first of all it's all that and the excitement was in part because so much could [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=44.92s)]
*  have gone wrong with this thing and the fact that nothing went wrong we were ecstatic. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=51.12s)]
*  Could you explain how complicated it is to get something like that? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=58.72s)]
*  So one of the great challenges that we face is how do you put a telescope in orbit that's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=63.28s)]
*  bigger than the rocket that's going to launch it? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=68.48s)]
*  Is that even possible? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=71.76s)]
*  And the Hubble telescope, do you know what set the size of that? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  94 inch diameter mirror? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  That's the biggest mirror you could fit in the payload of the space shuttle. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=80.16s)]
*  That's what set the size of that telescope. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=86.36s)]
*  Big as it was, we would have made it bigger if the space shuttle were bigger. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=88.96s)]
*  Now I don't know if you've seen the Hubble telescope, there's a replica of it at the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=93.66s)]
*  Air and Space Museum. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=96.48s)]
*  Let's take a photo of it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=97.48s)]
*  It's there hanging from the ceiling but if you want to know how, it's about the size [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=100.48s)]
*  of a Greyhound bus. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=103.08s)]
*  So the space shuttle deployed a Greyhound bus into orbit which is the Hubble space telescope [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=105.44s)]
*  and the value of the Hubble was that you could update it with servicing missions and it was [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=112.03999999999999s)]
*  serviced many times and as a result it lived within our culture for three decades. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  There are people who came of age only ever knowing the majesty of the universe as delivered [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=124.96s)]
*  to you by the Hubble telescope. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=131.32s)]
*  30 years worth of this, think about it. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=133.16s)]
*  Most other telescopes they put into orbit and they have a five year mission and then [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=136.24s)]
*  they come down so they don't have a chance to get inside you to become something that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=139.88s)]
*  you...oh you got a nice visual there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=146.96s)]
*  The Hubble telescope on the left which every year, every year I post a tweet at the end [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=150.56s)]
*  of the Stanley Cup and I say the Stanley Cup and the Hubble telescope had the same designer. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=158.6s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=163.56s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=164.56s)]
*  No, just look at the thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=165.56s)]
*  It looks like the Stanley Cup. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=167.07999999999998s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=168.6s)]
*  I wouldn't confuse the two if they were in a room together. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=170.32s)]
*  So here's the thing. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=174.6s)]
*  So notice the Hubble telescope, its diameter is the spherical shape that fits in the spherical [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=175.88s)]
*  payload of the space shuttle. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  So now we want to put a bigger telescope into orbit. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=183.68s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=187.56s)]
*  And so this is where you need engineers, clever engineers. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  They say, here's a rocket, one of the most powerful rockets we can use, but the fairing, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=193.48s)]
*  that's the place where you hold the payload, can only be so big. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=199.72s)]
*  And they say, all right, why don't we fold the telescope? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=204.32s)]
*  Now how are you going to fold the mirror? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  Oh, you turn the mirror into segments, hexagons. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=209.04s)]
*  Hexagons, one of only three shapes that can tile a surface, a square, a triangle, and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=212.44s)]
*  a hexagon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=218.64s)]
*  No other shape can do this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=219.72s)]
*  So well, you can have other irregular shapes that can match up. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=221.44s)]
*  You can tessellate what it's called. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=226.12s)]
*  But if you have what's called a regular polygon, so here in the image there, what you can see [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=227.74s)]
*  is all of the mirror segments. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=233.28s)]
*  Those fold into a narrow structure along with the unfurling solar panels as well as the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=235.88s)]
*  heat shield. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=247.2s)]
*  This was made at Northrop Grumman. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=249.2s)]
*  By the way, Grumman has a long history in helping NASA put stuff in space. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  The LEM, Lunar Excursion Module, remember that? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=256.44s)]
*  The thing that landed on the moon? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  That was designed and built in Bethpage, Long Island at Grumman Aerospace. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=261.96s)]
*  And so this is, and you go to Bethpage today, people still stand tall because they had aunts [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=268.0s)]
*  and uncles who worked on that project. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=273.56s)]
*  Space is a force of nature unto itself in our sense of pride, in our sense of achievement, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=276.68s)]
*  in our sense of what operates on civilization to take us into the future lest we continue [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=283.92s)]
*  to regress and move back into the cave which we came. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=291.24s)]
*  There it is all folded up in the image we now see for those who are watching this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=296.16s)]
*  You slip that into a fairing and then you launch it a million miles from Earth, opposite [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=301.88s)]
*  the sun from Earth, and it unfurls like petals of a flower. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=309.8s)]
*  Is there an animation of how that goes down? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=315.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, slow-mo animation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=318.04s)]
*  Sure he can find it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=320.12s)]
*  And it's the deployment, how it deployed as it was on its way to its location which is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=321.8s)]
*  one of the Lagrangian points in orbit. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=326.68s)]
*  For every two objects that orbit each other, there are five Lagrangian points. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=330.24s)]
*  So here we are unfolding. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=334.72s)]
*  So there we have solar panels coming out the side and there's the communication antenna [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=336.24s)]
*  and it has a unique set of baffles that shield it from sunlight so that the mirror and the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=345.36s)]
*  detector can be very, very cold because it's designed, it's specially tuned to observe [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=355.76s)]
*  infrared that comes to us from space. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=363.76s)]
*  And infrared, as you may know, we normally associate it with heat. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=367.68s)]
*  Well how am I going to detect something that's very, very cold in space if my detector is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=372.4s)]
*  hotter than what I'm trying to detect? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=377.28s)]
*  There's no way to see something that is warmer than the temperature of your detector. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=381.32s)]
*  So your detector has to be very cold, extremely cold. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  So these are the baffles and there are many, many layers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=391.56s)]
*  So that when sunlight hits one layer, that layer absorbs it and re-radiates it in both [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=394.84s)]
*  directions forward and back. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=400.4s)]
*  So there's less that goes to the next layer. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=402.53999999999996s)]
*  So then the next layer re-radiates it and by the time it gets to the fourth layer, hardly [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=404.52s)]
*  anything goes towards the telescope. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=408.71999999999997s)]
*  And so it's insulated and it drops to deep space, cold temperatures. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=411.0s)]
*  And it's literally where the sun don't shine right now. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=416.84s)]
*  So the solar pounders are getting this solar energy from the bottom. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=421.26s)]
*  Yeah, because that's the direction the sun is, correct. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=425.36s)]
*  So it radiates off the bottom and those are the things that protect it and you see all [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=427.6s)]
*  those layers. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=431.36s)]
*  All the layers, yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=432.36s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=433.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=434.52s)]
*  And it's specifically tuned for the infrared part of the spectrum. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=435.52s)]
*  You remember the spectrum. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=439.8s)]
*  So you have like visible light, right? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=440.8s)]
*  ROYGBIV, right, if you want to remember it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=443.56s)]
*  Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=446.16s)]
*  Those are the parts of the spectrum we can see. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=449.28000000000003s)]
*  But there's light outside of this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  There's like beyond the violet, there's ultraviolet. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=454.68s)]
*  That's how you get that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=458.24s)]
*  And below the red is infrared. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=459.32s)]
*  Not visible to the human eye. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=462.08000000000004s)]
*  By the way, insects can see ultraviolet. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=463.64s)]
*  We can't. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=465.92s)]
*  That's why bug zappers work. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=466.92s)]
*  You put a UV light in a bug zapper. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=468.06s)]
*  The bugs say, oh my gosh, I love ultraviolet. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=471.18s)]
*  And then they get zapped. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=474.52s)]
*  And we're old enough to remember before there were bug zappers, you'd had a picnic bulb [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=475.94s)]
*  for Twilight Picnics and it's like a yellow bulb, kind of yellow amber bulb. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=482.18s)]
*  It was a bug bulb. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=486.58s)]
*  It was sold as bug bulbs. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=487.86s)]
*  It's not that they repelled bugs. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=489.76s)]
*  It's that the bugs couldn't even see it because their whole vision is shifted towards the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=491.86s)]
*  ultraviolet. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=497.5s)]
*  And it leaves out the deep red. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=498.5s)]
*  So that's evidence we're smarter than bugs. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=501.58s)]
*  One piece of evidence that we're smarter than bugs. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=505.06s)]
*  So just to bring that to a closure, the earliest forming galaxies in the universe radiated [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=511.32s)]
*  a lot of ultraviolet. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=518.38s)]
*  So you might say, well, let's get an ultraviolet telescope. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=519.38s)]
*  No. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=522.5799999999999s)]
*  14 billion years later, the expansion of the universe has redshifted the ultraviolet into [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=523.7s)]
*  the infrared. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=530.26s)]
*  So if you want to see the birth of galaxies, you got to know what they look like in the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  here and the now. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=538.58s)]
*  And in the here and the now, it's in the infrared. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=539.6600000000001s)]
*  So this is a telescope specifically tuned to see galaxies born at the edge of the universe. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=542.62s)]
*  And infrared also allows you to see deep into gas clouds. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=548.58s)]
*  Now, when they're showing you an image like this... [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=553.6999999999999s)]
*  So right here, this is the pillars of creation, which were so named at the time Hubble first [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=555.26s)]
*  attempted this. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=559.74s)]
*  We were gaga over the Hubble image of this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=560.8199999999999s)]
*  And now, like the JWST, oh my gosh. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=563.78s)]
*  For those who are more prone to religion, some have called this the hand of God. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=567.72s)]
*  Because if you look at the pillars, you can kind of picture like a thumb and fingers. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=572.02s)]
*  But regardless, this is nearby. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=581.66s)]
*  This is the telescope peering deep into gas clouds that otherwise wouldn't shroud what's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=585.26s)]
*  going on. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=591.5799999999999s)]
*  And you get to see stars being born, planets being born. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=592.86s)]
*  And so what's remarkable about JWST is that to be tuned for the edge of the universe and [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=596.9s)]
*  the birth of galaxies is the same properties you would want to see the birth of stars. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=603.94s)]
*  A star is born right in front of your nose that would otherwise be cloaked by gas. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=613.7s)]
*  And infrared penetrates those clouds and enables you to see it as though the cloud isn't even [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=620.1s)]
*  there. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=625.22s)]
*  And you already know this because if you're driving through fog, okay, you put on your [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=626.22s)]
*  fog lights. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=631.5s)]
*  The fog lights are not blue. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=632.86s)]
*  They're like reddish amber. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=634.26s)]
*  That improves your ability to see through the fog. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=637.54s)]
*  If we could see infrared, that's the kind of light you'd use, then you wouldn't even know [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=640.66s)]
*  the fog was there. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=644.98s)]
*  That's why self-driving cars will be amazing. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=646.86s)]
*  It won't matter if it's foggy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=649.46s)]
*  They'll be able to see everything. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=650.46s)]
*  Just give them infrared sensors. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=652.14s)]
*  The fog is irrelevant. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=654.1s)]
*  They can drive 100 miles an hour in dense fog and all the cars will see each other. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=655.1s)]
*  And they want to change lanes, they tell other cars, I'm going to change lanes. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=659.5s)]
*  They'll park for them, open up, and we won't get 40,000 deaths a year as we currently do [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=662.06s)]
*  from automobile accidents. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=668.5799999999999s)]
*  Now how much bigger is this telescope? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=671.14s)]
*  So you want to think about collecting area. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=675.9399999999999s)]
*  I forgot the exact number. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=677.78s)]
*  Something like eight times around there, more powerful in the sense of you can see things [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=680.42s)]
*  eight times dimmer. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=686.26s)]
*  There you go. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=687.7399999999999s)]
*  So that's about two and a half squared. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=689.42s)]
*  That's about eight times the area. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=691.98s)]
*  And the technology obviously has improved as well. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=694.18s)]
*  So the ability that... [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=697.42s)]
*  Well our detectors are better. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=699.98s)]
*  And let me remind you that when the Hubble was designed, it was designed in the 1980s [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=701.98s)]
*  and it was scheduled to go up. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=706.1s)]
*  And then we had the Challenger accident. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=708.98s)]
*  And that delayed the shuttle program. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=711.38s)]
*  So there's Hubble sitting there in mothballs with an old Microsoft chip. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=712.78s)]
*  And by the time it launched, it was already not as fast as it could have been. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=718.36s)]
*  And so the very first servicing mission swapped all that out and put in better methods and [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=722.32s)]
*  tools for measuring what it is we always needed it to do. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  So this is... [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=732.88s)]
*  So one sad part about this is that it's not serviceable. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=734.08s)]
*  We have no access to that point in space a million miles from the moon. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=739.7600000000001s)]
*  We haven't left low Earth orbit since 1972. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=744.5200000000001s)]
*  We're not going out a million miles from Earth to fix a telescope. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=747.2s)]
*  So that's unfortunate. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=750.32s)]
*  Maybe a robotic fix? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=751.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=752.96s)]
*  Or to refill some of the fuel. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=753.96s)]
*  It needs fuel to station keep. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=757.32s)]
*  Didn't it get hit by a micrometeor? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=759.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  Well that's the breaks when you're in space. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=764.76s)]
*  But it doesn't affect the overall performance. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=765.76s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=769.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=770.9200000000001s)]
*  Well it's huge. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=771.9200000000001s)]
*  And micrometeors will do small damage. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=772.9200000000001s)]
*  You don't want to be in the middle of a meteor storm. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=774.64s)]
*  That would be totally bad. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=776.36s)]
*  Do they obviously know where some of the asteroid belts are and where some of the nearby Earth [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=779.3199999999999s)]
*  objects are? [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  So in this context, so first most asteroids are in the asteroid belt. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=788.92s)]
*  So that's between Mars and Jupiter. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=794.18s)]
*  So I have an asteroid named after me. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=796.9s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't mean to brag or anything. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=800.1999999999999s)]
*  Can't you get a star named after you online? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=802.52s)]
*  Not legally. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=804.72s)]
*  Not authentically. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=805.72s)]
*  You just get robbed. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=806.72s)]
*  Just pretend it's yours. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=807.72s)]
*  They send you a map with your name drawn in the map. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=808.72s)]
*  So you pay for a piece of paper. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=812.24s)]
*  Yeah, they claim that it gets registered with the astrophysicist, but it doesn't. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=813.24s)]
*  There's only one way we name stars and that's by committee and by traditions and this sort [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=819.6s)]
*  of thing. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=823.56s)]
*  They're fascinating traditions. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=824.56s)]
*  So planets are named after Roman gods and planet moons are named after Greek characters [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=825.92s)]
*  in the life of the Greek god who's the counterpart to that Roman god. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=835.24s)]
*  So Jupiter, for example, one of its moons is Ganymede. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=841.86s)]
*  Ganymede was the manservant of Zeus and Zeus and Jupiter were corresponding gods in Greek [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=846.0s)]
*  and Roman. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  And only that two, what's the number, is it about half, somewhere around there of all [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=853.84s)]
*  the stars in the night sky that have names, have Arabic names. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=859.2s)]
*  So in my field, we have deep respect for people who made great inroads into understanding [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=863.36s)]
*  the natural universe and the golden age of Islam from a thousand years ago made material [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=869.36s)]
*  contributions in this regard. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=874.84s)]
*  And of course, Greek and Roman legends and this sort of thing. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=877.2s)]
*  So there they are in its influence on Western culture. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=879.4000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, the universe is a fun place. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=883.12s)]
*  Pretty fun place. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=885.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=886.8s)]
*  So this James Webb telescope, in terms of its ability to recognize things, what magnitude [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=887.8s)]
*  of improvement are we talking about from the Hubble? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=893.88s)]
*  Yeah, a factor of 10. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=896.68s)]
*  Yeah, easily. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=897.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=898.68s)]
*  Well, a factor of 10 for the things Hubble could see, but it's incalculable when it sees [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=899.68s)]
*  things that Hubble could have never seen because Hubble was not tuned for the infrared. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=906.0s)]
*  So then you can't even compare it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=911.08s)]
*  It's a complete other window opened up to the universe for you. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=912.36s)]
*  So what has changed in terms of our understanding? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=916.6800000000001s)]
*  The web has been in the million mile orbit or however far away it is for how long now? [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=921.84s)]
*  Well, it got there and then we did some engineering. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=929.4s)]
*  So I guess a year, year and a half. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=932.32s)]
*  And what has changed in our understanding? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=934.6s)]
*  So that's been people's first question. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=937.4s)]
*  And what I want to do is temper that to say something a little different. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=940.3199999999999s)]
*  So yes, we expect James Webb to make great discoveries. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=945.92s)]
*  We expect that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=951.1999999999999s)]
*  But the first order of business is hardly ever, let's discover something new today. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=952.84s)]
*  It's here's something that we have limited understanding of. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=958.76s)]
*  Let's improve on that. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=962.16s)]
*  And in so doing, we deepen our understanding of how things work in the universe. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=964.28s)]
*  That doesn't always involve overturning a previous idea or discovering something that [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=968.64s)]
*  nobody ordered. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=973.0s)]
*  That will happen. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=975.12s)]
*  We fully expect that to happen. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=976.12s)]
*  But we targeted parts of the sky initially because we know other telescopes have gone [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=978.04s)]
*  there before. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=983.52s)]
*  And we're going to say, how can we further advance and deepen our understanding? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=984.52s)]
*  One thing it's going to be able to do and it has already done. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=988.36s)]
*  We have, you know how many exoplanets there are? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=990.56s)]
*  I don't know how many of your audience was born after 1995. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=994.16s)]
*  How many 27 year olds and young? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1000.76s)]
*  Probably quite a few. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1002.52s)]
*  Quite a few. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1003.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1004.52s)]
*  So I will take this opportunity to knight them. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1005.52s)]
*  Generation X-o-planet. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1009.68s)]
*  Ah, I see what you did there. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1010.68s)]
*  1995 was the first exoplanet discovered, a planet orbiting another star. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1013.68s)]
*  I'll never forget that because it was my first time on national television. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1020.84s)]
*  I was freshly minted as director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1024.24s)]
*  And NBC sent the, New York City is the media news headquarters, right, of all the networks. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1029.4s)]
*  So NBC sent an action cam. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1035.6000000000001s)]
*  They interviewed me because of my title, not because they knew or gave crap who I was. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1038.0s)]
*  My title was director of the planetarium. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1043.8s)]
*  And so I gave my best professorial reply. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1046.52s)]
*  I said, well, the Doppler shift, this is how it's discovered and what we do and how we [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1049.96s)]
*  measure it. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1053.48s)]
*  And I was describing the fact that when you discover these planets, you don't actually [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1056.24s)]
*  see the planet. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1059.68s)]
*  You see the effect of the planet's gravity on the host star. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1060.68s)]
*  And so if you'd watch the host star, the host star like jiggles, okay, just a little bit [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1064.92s)]
*  in response to the planet going back and forth around it. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1070.44s)]
*  So you're measuring the star. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1074.76s)]
*  I motioned that like with my hips and that evening on the evening news, that's all they [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1076.48s)]
*  showed was me jiggling my hips. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1082.4s)]
*  I said, oh my gosh. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1084.44s)]
*  Okay, that's how you're going to do this. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1087.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1089.36s)]
*  You don't want me to be professor Neil. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1090.36s)]
*  You want me to be soundbite Neil. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1091.92s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1093.68s)]
*  So from then on, I practiced my soundbites and a soundbite is like three sentences. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1094.68s)]
*  Oh, so you recognize that this is the format now. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1099.64s)]
*  Correct. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1103.04s)]
*  And I said, I can't just give them my stump speech as professor of astrophysics. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1104.08s)]
*  It has to work in their medium. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1109.08s)]
*  And so I went home and stood in front of the mirror and had people just shout out things [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1111.24s)]
*  to me, anything in the universe, any idea, object, person, place or thing. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1116.6s)]
*  And I would come up with like three sentences that are interesting, make you smile and be [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1121.34s)]
*  tasty enough to want to tell someone else the anatomy of a soundbite. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1126.8799999999999s)]
*  Try it. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1130.52s)]
*  Say anything in the whole universe. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1131.52s)]
*  How do we know how? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1132.68s)]
*  Just one word. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1134.0800000000002s)]
*  Just say anything. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1135.0800000000002s)]
*  The big bang. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1136.52s)]
*  Big bang. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1137.6000000000001s)]
*  Ooh, the birth of space time energy and everything we know and love about this universe occurred [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1138.6000000000001s)]
*  14 billion years ago and we have no idea what happened before it. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1147.4s)]
*  And we're still expanding as we will forever. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1154.88s)]
*  I read an article. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1158.64s)]
*  That's my soundbite for the big bang. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1160.1000000000001s)]
*  It's a good soundbite. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1161.48s)]
*  I read an article about the web telescope and what they were taking into consideration [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1163.28s)]
*  is the possibility that the big bang may be incorrect and that the universe might be larger [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1168.6s)]
*  and older than we think. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1174.5s)]
*  So I hesitate to ask what pages on the internet you hang out on? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1177.18s)]
*  It was a legit, it wasn't saying the universe is older. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1183.84s)]
*  It's saying as more data and new information comes in, there is a distinct possibility [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1188.3200000000002s)]
*  that the big bang might just be the, it just might explain the reach of the technology [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1193.72s)]
*  and not the actual scale of the universe itself. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1200.2s)]
*  Okay, so the way to think about this is, and this is the way science has worked since basically [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1202.52s)]
*  the year 1600 where Galileo sort of starts codifying what people knew probably should [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1209.26s)]
*  be happening but no one really did it in large scale. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1216.3999999999999s)]
*  If you have an idea about something, then you test it multiple ways and get other people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1218.8s)]
*  to test it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1223.24s)]
*  And if the tests give you consistent results, you have a new understanding of the universe. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1224.24s)]
*  When that happens, that knowledge of the universe doesn't go away. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1230.28s)]
*  It doesn't get undone. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1236.52s)]
*  What happens typically is you have a deeper understanding of the universe in which that [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1239.32s)]
*  understanding gets embedded and you realize that you only understood a small part of a [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1244.78s)]
*  larger whole. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1250.54s)]
*  But the small parts you did understand where you had multiple experiments that confirmed [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1251.86s)]
*  it, that doesn't change. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1257.22s)]
*  So the cleanest example of this, and I'll get back to your question, is Newton's laws [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1259.94s)]
*  of motion and gravity. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1264.46s)]
*  Did anyone see anything move faster than a galloping horse in his day? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1267.94s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1272.66s)]
*  And so the Newton's laws of motion and gravity worked. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1273.78s)]
*  They worked not only for galloping horses, it worked for the moon in orbit around the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1278.02s)]
*  earth and the earth in orbit around the sun and Jupiter's moons in orbit around Jupiter [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1282.46s)]
*  and for the planets. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1289.18s)]
*  So okay, but wait a minute, it doesn't work for Mercury. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1291.18s)]
*  Mercury's orbit is not following Newton's laws. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1296.46s)]
*  Is there something wrong with the data? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1299.1s)]
*  Let's check it. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1301.46s)]
*  Correct. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1302.6200000000001s)]
*  Oh my gosh, what's happening? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1303.6200000000001s)]
*  Einstein comes along and says I have a new understanding of gravity and a new understanding [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1305.78s)]
*  of motion. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1310.4s)]
*  And it accounts for this weirdness in Mercury's orbit. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1312.22s)]
*  What was the weirdness? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1314.98s)]
*  Its shape was not exactly what Newton's laws of gravity would give you. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1317.1000000000001s)]
*  Its shape could only be accounted for when you throw in Einstein's theory of general [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1321.82s)]
*  relativity. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1326.18s)]
*  Why? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1327.5s)]
*  Because the sun's gravity is so monstrous and Mercury's orbiting close enough to it [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1329.1799999999998s)]
*  that it's being influenced by extra phenomenon going on in the universe that's the product [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1334.54s)]
*  of very high and significant gravity. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1339.8999999999999s)]
*  And so then do we throw Newton out the window? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1343.1799999999998s)]
*  No actually. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1347.4199999999998s)]
*  You know what Newton's laws are? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1349.02s)]
*  They're what Einstein's laws look like when you put in low speeds and low gravity. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1350.62s)]
*  If you put in low speeds and low gravity, they become Newton's laws. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  In that limit. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1361.82s)]
*  Newton's laws don't stop working where they used to work. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1364.06s)]
*  Apollo to the moon used only Newton's laws. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1367.6599999999999s)]
*  Because Einstein didn't matter at those scales. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1372.62s)]
*  The moon and earth and rockets were not going fast enough for any of that to matter. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1375.4199999999998s)]
*  But when you start going fast enough you cannot use Newton's laws. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1380.98s)]
*  You have to use a deeper understanding. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1384.6599999999999s)]
*  Now where does Einstein take us? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1386.34s)]
*  You go into the center of a black hole, you get black holes from Einstein. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1389.86s)]
*  Center of black hole is a singularity. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1394.26s)]
*  All the theories say the matter occupies zero volume thereby having infinite density. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1397.06s)]
*  And that's kind of weird. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1404.1399999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1405.1399999999999s)]
*  No you can't have infinite. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1406.1399999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1407.6599999999999s)]
*  That's a limit of Einstein's theory. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1409.3799999999999s)]
*  That's where it breaks down. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1412.1799999999998s)]
*  Some have joked that's where God divides by zero. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1413.22s)]
*  Remember in math class you can't divide by zero. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1415.14s)]
*  It's not defined or not allowed. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1418.1000000000001s)]
*  So in Einstein's equations we're dividing by zero at the singularity. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1420.14s)]
*  So we all know that as brilliant as Einstein was and as successful as his general theory [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1424.18s)]
*  of relativity has been, it has limits. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1430.54s)]
*  And one limit is the center of a black hole and another limit is the very birth of the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1434.18s)]
*  universe itself. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1439.94s)]
*  So that's raising back to your question, the Big Bang. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1442.14s)]
*  So we have top people working on trying to resolve the singularity problem. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1444.9s)]
*  And in so doing you get to some ideas that maybe our Big Bang, because the Big Bang is [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1450.8200000000002s)]
*  not going to go away. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1456.5s)]
*  All the data support this. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1457.5s)]
*  So now I've got this Big Bang thing. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1459.0200000000002s)]
*  And well is this embedded in something bigger? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1462.46s)]
*  So when you put like quantum physics and general relativity and you try to come up with some [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1469.02s)]
*  bigger understanding, deeper understanding, strength theorists have been all into this, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1474.22s)]
*  you get a multiverse. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1479.5s)]
*  We didn't pull that out of our ass. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1481.7s)]
*  That came out of the equations. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1483.02s)]
*  So how old is the multiverse? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1485.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1488.02s)]
*  It's definitely older than our universe because it birthed our universe and it births other [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1489.58s)]
*  universes and it births the way the equations drive it and infinity of universes. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1493.7s)]
*  This is the idea that maybe there's a version of us in another where I'm bald and you got [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1501.54s)]
*  the afro and who is, but everything else is the same. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1505.8600000000001s)]
*  And also a version where everything's the same. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1509.1000000000001s)]
*  Where everything would be the same, yes. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1511.5800000000002s)]
*  Everything you've ever said has been said before exactly in the same order. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1513.94s)]
*  Correct. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1517.1000000000001s)]
*  There's no reason to presume that everything in this universe isn't or hasn't already played [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1518.1000000000001s)]
*  out in the exact way in another one of these infinite universes. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1523.56s)]
*  And in an infinite number of different ways. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1528.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1531.2s)]
*  And so that is what comes out of the equations. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1532.2s)]
*  So that makes the Big Bang a kind of a small part of a much larger whole. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1534.98s)]
*  And so yeah, we're ready for that. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1539.56s)]
*  But the fact that the universe had a beginning 14 billion years ago and there's the cosmic [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1542.34s)]
*  microwave background, all of these features are intact. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1546.52s)]
*  They're not going to all of a sudden not apply. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1552.24s)]
*  That's my point. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1555.12s)]
*  That's my long answer to your very clean question. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1556.12s)]
*  So this thing that happened 14 billion years ago, what is the predominant theory of why? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1557.12s)]
*  So this multiverse concept gives us a reason why. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1565.96s)]
*  So it's like imagine you're rolling around in a basin. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1571.9199999999998s)]
*  You're stable there. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1581.08s)]
*  You're just fine. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1582.76s)]
*  But then something kicks you out of the basin and you didn't know that there's a huge hill [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1584.28s)]
*  to roll down after you come out of that basin. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1590.36s)]
*  But you didn't know that you thought everything was just fine. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1593.28s)]
*  You roll down that hill, you're gaining energy. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1595.8s)]
*  At the bottom of the hill, something stops you. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1599.7s)]
*  And then where does all that energy go? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1604.42s)]
*  One of the hypotheses, and I'm highly simplifying here, is that the energy gained by rolling [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1607.44s)]
*  down a hill, and these are energy hills that would exist in this sort of higher dimensional [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1612.5600000000002s)]
*  space that we're talking about, that energy has to manifest in that object somehow and [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1617.92s)]
*  it becomes an explosion. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1624.72s)]
*  It gives birth with enough energy, it gives birth to matter, everything that we know and [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1625.72s)]
*  love, and it expands. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1630.16s)]
*  Because when you concentrate that much energy in a small spot, that's the only thing you [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1631.92s)]
*  can do. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1636.0s)]
*  I understand that you're simplifying it, but I don't understand... [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1637.0s)]
*  Simplify it in the sense that by using this basin analogy and rolling down a hill, that [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1639.32s)]
*  they're equations of the energetics of a system, and this is called a false vacuum. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1644.92s)]
*  So you can be in a place that's not the true bottom energy state of the system, but you [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1655.0s)]
*  think everything is fine, but it's not. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1660.92s)]
*  And so if you move around among these hills and valleys, you end up birthing universes [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1664.84s)]
*  out the other side. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1671.9599999999998s)]
*  And this multiverse concept actually delivers this for you, basically for free. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1673.6s)]
*  That thought would be that the Big Bang is just one of many events that happen in the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1680.4399999999998s)]
*  multiverse. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1688.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1689.04s)]
*  It could be that other Big Bang events might have a slightly different laws of physics [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1690.6399999999999s)]
*  in it. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1699.72s)]
*  So you want to watch out for that. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1701.08s)]
*  If you cross over from one universe to the other, and the charge on the electron is slightly [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1703.68s)]
*  different, you could like, all your atoms could just scatter or compress into a pile [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1709.0s)]
*  of goo. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1715.72s)]
*  Yeah, so take something to test first. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1716.72s)]
*  Yeah, send a chicken out there. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1719.6399999999999s)]
*  Chicken's getting no respect. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1721.6399999999999s)]
*  What happened to guinea pigs? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1724.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, guinea pigs are cute and have fur. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1727.0s)]
*  They're cute and furry. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1729.52s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1730.84s)]
*  Chickens are way easier to just send to space. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1732.48s)]
*  I spent a whole section in this book talking about people who love animals and want to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1733.9599999999998s)]
*  care for them and don't want to eat them, but the only loved ones that are cuddly. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1744.56s)]
*  You make a plush toy out of it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1745.56s)]
*  My agent said that. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1746.9599999999998s)]
*  She knows I hunt. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1748.28s)]
*  I think you should hunt pigs because they're ugly. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1749.28s)]
*  Oh! [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1751.0s)]
*  I'm like, how dare you? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1752.0s)]
*  First of all, domesticated pigs are adorable. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1754.96s)]
*  They are, in fact. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1758.16s)]
*  Yeah, domesticated dogs are ugly too because they're desperate. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1759.16s)]
*  In fact, I have a voice cameo of a pig in a Disney XD cartoon called Gravity Falls. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1762.2s)]
*  It's a farmhouse and there's a pig that lives with everybody. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1773.12s)]
*  The pig eats some slop that the kids are told makes you smarter. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1776.6s)]
*  They bought it at a fair or something. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1781.6399999999999s)]
*  They went to sleep putting the slop on their forehead thinking it would get into their [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1783.56s)]
*  head and make them smart. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1787.36s)]
*  The pig sees it on their forehead and licks it off of their forehead. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1788.52s)]
*  Then overnight, the pig becomes a supreme genius, builds an atom smasher, builds a voice [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1792.1599999999999s)]
*  translator and while the pig is smart, I'm its voice. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1797.76s)]
*  It's cute. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1801.6s)]
*  It's a cute. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1802.6s)]
*  Big bang, multiverses, different laws of physics. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1803.6s)]
*  Slightly different laws of physics are a fascinating prospect. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1809.6s)]
*  How they might vary and how you might want to avoid it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1812.6s)]
*  Oh, when I was talking about if you want to save animals, I've never seen anyone say, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1815.28s)]
*  save the leeches. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1822.28s)]
*  No, no one cares about bugs. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1824.28s)]
*  Save the ticks. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1826.28s)]
*  In particular, parasites. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1827.28s)]
*  Save the mosquitoes. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1828.28s)]
*  Mosquitoes, the biggest enemy of humans, as big an enemy as we are to each other through [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1830.96s)]
*  warfare in the history of civilization, the greatest enemy to human life has been the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1835.96s)]
*  mosquito. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1842.96s)]
*  Responsible for more than a billion human deaths in the history of civilization. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1843.96s)]
*  Here we have mosquitoes, ticks, tapeworms, insects, and so on. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1848.96s)]
*  Mosquitoes, ticks, tapeworms, you know, go down the list and you can ask if you're really [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1856.64s)]
*  into animals and don't want to kill them, if you heard that ticks were endangered, would [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1865.64s)]
*  you start a movement to protect ticks? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1871.48s)]
*  Would you do that? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1874.64s)]
*  And if you would, more power to you. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1876.24s)]
*  But I'm thinking you're not. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1878.92s)]
*  Why would you if you know about Lyme disease? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1880.68s)]
*  This is my point. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1883.54s)]
*  Yeah, or... [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1884.54s)]
*  This is my point. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1886.12s)]
*  By the way, the Lyme virus wants to live too, right? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1887.12s)]
*  These are all creatures on God's green earth, right? [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1889.6599999999999s)]
*  And so you end up being a species bigot. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1893.1s)]
*  In the chapter meatarians and vegetarians, there's the philosophies that each of those [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1897.98s)]
*  camps will embrace. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1906.22s)]
*  And the question is how thoroughly thought through are those philosophies? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1909.1s)]
*  In one example, let's say you don't want to kill animals, but you... [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1914.22s)]
*  So you have a humane mousetrap in your basement. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1917.94s)]
*  Okay? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1922.2600000000002s)]
*  Why not? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1923.2600000000002s)]
*  You don't want to snap the neck of the mouse. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1924.2600000000002s)]
*  That's cruel. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1926.94s)]
*  And you like animals, right? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1927.94s)]
*  So you save the mouse. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1930.38s)]
*  You've got to check on it every few days because they dry out quickly if you trap it. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1931.38s)]
*  And so what do you do when you catch it? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1936.5s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1938.3400000000001s)]
*  Release it back into the wild. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1939.3400000000001s)]
*  Guaranteeing the mouse gets eaten whole by an owl or pecked apart by all manner of woodland [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1942.22s)]
*  predators between nine and 18 months of its life. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1948.54s)]
*  So the safest thing to do with your mouse is to leave it in your basement. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1954.98s)]
*  If you really care about animal life and the mouse managed to get into your basement, leave [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1960.42s)]
*  it there. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1966.44s)]
*  It'll live up to six years in your basement. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1967.44s)]
*  I lived in Colorado for a while next to an ashram. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1968.8999999999999s)]
*  And I was visiting the ashram and talking to the woman who runs it. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1972.06s)]
*  And she sprayed raid all over these ants. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1975.34s)]
*  And I go, what are you doing? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1979.3799999999999s)]
*  And she's like, well, it's unfortunate, but we have to address the fact that we have an [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1981.78s)]
*  infestation of insects. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1986.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you just mass killed all these living beings with poison from the sky. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1988.74s)]
*  And you did it in front of me. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1997.18s)]
*  Aerial assault. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1998.9s)]
*  While you're espousing the benefits of Buddhism and meditation. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=1999.9s)]
*  And yeah, so people kind of cherry pick. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2005.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2009.78s)]
*  And I understand it. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2010.78s)]
*  And I don't mind if someone cherry picks as long as they're completely self aware. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2013.22s)]
*  Most people aren't. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2018.8600000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the home that where you're saving the mouse, I did a rough calculation. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2019.8600000000001s)]
*  It's probably made from the wood of about 50 trees. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2026.8s)]
*  Each tree could have lived 100 years, but didn't because it was cut down to make your [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2030.28s)]
*  home. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2034.12s)]
*  The two by fours, the two by fours, the floorboards, the wall panels, the siding. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2035.12s)]
*  And each of those trees was home to birds and insects and fungus and squirrels. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2043.52s)]
*  And every day of that tree's life, via photosynthesis, it created 15 times the mass of the mouse [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2053.08s)]
*  in breathable oxygen. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2063.24s)]
*  So I ask you, who do you think nature cares more about? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2066.16s)]
*  The tree or your one ounce mouse? [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2071.88s)]
*  Probably the tree. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2074.8s)]
*  I'm thinking. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2076.48s)]
*  And some trees live a thousand years. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2078.04s)]
*  Have you paid attention to some of the new research that's being done about how trees [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2080.56s)]
*  communicate with each other? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2084.0s)]
*  I'll get to that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2085.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll get to that. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2086.0s)]
*  That's in that chapter, the meatarians and vegetarian chapter. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2087.0s)]
*  So trees are fascinating. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2089.44s)]
*  I've heard people say, well, the mouse has a beating heart and the tree does not, or [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2091.6s)]
*  plants do not and animals do. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2096.4s)]
*  And I said to my, well, let me think this through. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2099.32s)]
*  If you cloak a tree, does it not suffocate? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  If you cut a tree, does it not bleed? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2107.66s)]
*  If you cut off its nutrients at the base, does it not wither and die? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2111.5s)]
*  Well, when they're aware they're being eaten, they release plant defense chemicals. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2117.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm getting there. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2121.66s)]
*  I'm getting there. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2122.66s)]
*  All I'm saying is the tree gets nutrients from the soil to the topmost leaf. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2123.66s)]
*  It does it not for want of a beating heart. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2131.42s)]
*  It does it in spite of not having one. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2135.18s)]
*  It has a circulation. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2139.22s)]
*  It just has a different way of life. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2140.94s)]
*  It's where I get my maple syrup from, tree blood. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2143.74s)]
*  So to fault a tree or plant life for not having a beating heart, when it's not that they need [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2149.98s)]
*  one and don't have one, it's that they don't need one and never wanted one. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2155.3199999999997s)]
*  Now you're talking about the mycelium. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2160.3399999999997s)]
*  So this is an interconnected network. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2163.78s)]
*  It's a fungal network underfoot in a forest where it connects multiple kingdoms of life. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  There are four kingdoms. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2173.34s)]
*  You might have learned that there were two. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2174.7400000000002s)]
*  We've upped it since then. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2176.7000000000003s)]
*  Those two kingdoms are still intact, but like I said, now there's more. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2178.1800000000003s)]
*  It's embedded in a larger truth. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2182.38s)]
*  There's the plant kingdom, animal kingdom, fungal kingdom, and then we have a kingdom [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2183.6200000000003s)]
*  the bacteria and archaea and other microscopic life forms. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2189.2200000000003s)]
*  And so here's an interesting fact. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2194.9s)]
*  I lost sleep for a week over this already. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2197.5s)]
*  If you look at the common ancestor between fungus and animals, because the tree of life [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2201.7400000000002s)]
*  has ultimately has one taproot, okay, and as it splits, it speciates and you get all [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2208.94s)]
*  these things. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2216.22s)]
*  The diversity of life on earth is enabled by the fact that life can speciate. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2217.22s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2225.66s)]
*  You look at the common ancestor between animals and fungus, the common ancestor between humans [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2226.66s)]
*  and mushrooms split later than the common ancestor, than its common ancestor split with [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2232.5s)]
*  green plants. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2241.3799999999997s)]
*  What that means is we and mushrooms are more alike than either we or mushrooms are to green [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2243.76s)]
*  plants. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2253.84s)]
*  Well, mushrooms breathe oxygen. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2254.84s)]
*  All I'm saying is you could grill a portobello mushroom. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2258.5600000000004s)]
*  What's the first word people use to describe it? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2262.44s)]
*  Vegetarian. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2264.96s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2265.96s)]
*  No, you. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2266.96s)]
*  No, we talk about mushrooms tasting meaty. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2267.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2272.7200000000003s)]
*  No one has, last I checked, no one has ever accused kale of tasting meaty. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2274.68s)]
*  No. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2280.0s)]
*  So in a way, we're kind of biting into ourselves. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2281.0s)]
*  Plus mushrooms, shrooms, people have whole relationships with mushrooms. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2284.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2293.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2294.4399999999996s)]
*  So, and mushrooms are fungus. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2295.4399999999996s)]
*  Fungus thrives on our body. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2297.0s)]
*  Have you ever done psychedelic mushrooms? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2298.68s)]
*  I've never done anything psychedelic. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2300.2s)]
*  Can I tell you why? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2303.28s)]
*  Yeah, please do. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2304.6s)]
*  So I don't know if it's a good reason. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2305.96s)]
*  I don't know if it's the best reason that can exist, but for me it's a really good reason. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2308.6s)]
*  The human mind barely works as it is. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2314.24s)]
*  Barely. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2320.44s)]
*  You ever see a book of optical illusions? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2321.44s)]
*  No one doesn't love a good book of optical illusions. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2327.64s)]
*  And you turn the page, oh what is that? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2329.44s)]
*  Oh is it in the page? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2330.8s)]
*  Out of the page? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2331.8s)]
*  Is it longer? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2333.6000000000004s)]
*  Is it shorter? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2334.6000000000004s)]
*  And you scratch in your head. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2335.6000000000004s)]
*  These are simple line drawings that confound the human mind's ability to interpret. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2336.6000000000004s)]
*  Our brain barely works as an accurate decoder of the natural world around you. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2344.28s)]
*  You now want to stir in chemicals? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2353.76s)]
*  I recognize it'll take you on a ride, but I have always valued objective reality. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2357.76s)]
*  I don't want anything interfering with my understanding of what is actually happening [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2365.96s)]
*  in front of me. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2373.1600000000003s)]
*  And there are people who would claim that under the influence they're accessing some [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2374.84s)]
*  actual other reality. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2381.1600000000003s)]
*  All I can say is, if in that other reality you can invent the James Webb Space Telescope, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2384.8s)]
*  tell me about it. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2391.6s)]
*  If you can figure out how to fly, and if you can do that, tell us about it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2392.6s)]
*  And there are people who say, oh I visited Venus when I was on a head trip. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2400.36s)]
*  Did you bring back evidence? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2403.8s)]
*  Evidence matters? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2404.8s)]
*  No, but it was in their head. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2405.8s)]
*  The material world, what we're talking about is actual physical objects, right? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2408.52s)]
*  If you could bring back something. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2414.64s)]
*  The physical world, the physical universe. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2415.64s)]
*  What they're experiencing is something akin to, you could call it a hallucination, you [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2418.36s)]
*  could call it a portal where physical reality doesn't exist, and you only exist as consciousness. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2424.64s)]
*  Here's my skepticism. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2433.12s)]
*  I don't mind people saying that they visited another planet, or wherever they're visiting, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2434.66s)]
*  or some astral plane. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2439.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't, okay, write a travelogue and share it with people, as some have done. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2442.3399999999997s)]
*  I guess I would ask whether what you experienced is part of an objective reality that we can [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2451.22s)]
*  all recognize. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2458.58s)]
*  Because if it's not, then it's completely in your head. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2460.74s)]
*  And if it's completely in your head, it's less useful. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2464.1s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2467.42s)]
*  Part of an objective reality? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2468.42s)]
*  An objective reality. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2469.7400000000002s)]
*  So, here's an example. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2470.7400000000002s)]
*  When people have these near-death experiences, or one where they're dying on a table, and [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2475.2200000000003s)]
*  a common lead described, they leave their body and they look back on themselves. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2481.06s)]
*  That's a thing going, that's something. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2485.86s)]
*  Let's investigate this. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2488.7s)]
*  The test for whether you really left your body, or whether you were hallucinating it, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2492.5s)]
*  is get some writing that faces the ceiling, up above your body. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2498.98s)]
*  Okay? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2504.82s)]
*  They've done this experiment. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2505.82s)]
*  And if you're floating above your body, above that piece of paper, when you come back to [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2507.74s)]
*  life, you should be able to say what's written on that piece of paper. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2513.3s)]
*  That is yet to happen. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2516.46s)]
*  If you get above it. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2517.46s)]
*  Yeah, if you get above it, correct. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2518.46s)]
*  That is yet to happen. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2519.7s)]
*  That'd be really good. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2520.7s)]
*  Where would that piece of paper be suspended? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2521.8999999999996s)]
*  No, no, you have to put it up on a shelf or something. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2523.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be able to put it in a way that it would be clearly- [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2525.46s)]
*  But then the person would have to die knowing that piece of paper was there, and then be [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2528.14s)]
*  brought back? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2532.5s)]
*  Possibly. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2533.98s)]
*  If, yeah, I mean- [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2534.98s)]
*  So you'd have to tell them, hey, I know you're gonna die. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2537.98s)]
*  You're gonna die. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2541.2999999999997s)]
*  If you come back, I have a piece of paper up here. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2542.2999999999997s)]
*  Go read from it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2544.74s)]
*  That seems like a pretty ridiculous experiment to try to achieve. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2545.74s)]
*  If you care, wait, wait, wait, wait, pause. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2548.2999999999997s)]
*  From ridiculous experiments. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2550.94s)]
*  So like, hey, I know this guy's about to die, but instead of concentrating on bringing him [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2552.94s)]
*  back to life, let's write down on a piece of paper and leave it on the shelf. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2556.5800000000004s)]
*  But who the fuck is gonna do that? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2560.7400000000002s)]
*  You know what they did? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2562.34s)]
*  What? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2563.34s)]
*  In 1895, after Wilhelm Röntgen discovers X-rays and they find out it penetrates your [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2564.34s)]
*  body and you can see bones inside your body, you know what they did? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2570.86s)]
*  They set up X-ray machines at the bedside of dying people to see if they can see a soul [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2574.1400000000003s)]
*  leave the body. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2580.82s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2581.82s)]
*  Then everybody just got cancer from radiation. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2582.82s)]
*  They died from cancer? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2585.5s)]
*  I thought that was an admirable attempt. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2589.6600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2591.78s)]
*  To make a measurement. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2592.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2593.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2594.78s)]
*  But how would you possibly know that someone is going to die and or have a near-death experiment, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2595.78s)]
*  a near-death experience rather, and then put a piece of paper on a shelf? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2601.1000000000004s)]
*  What you'd have to do, you'd have to be really organized about that. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2606.5400000000004s)]
*  If you want to do this en masse. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2609.46s)]
*  You'd have to just like have shelves in every bedroom. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2611.1s)]
*  In every room. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2613.98s)]
*  Of every ER. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2614.98s)]
*  Every ER, correct. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2615.98s)]
*  Or, yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2616.98s)]
*  How often does that happen where people have above their body experiences? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2617.98s)]
*  It's very frequently reported. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2622.02s)]
*  Very frequently? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2623.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2624.5s)]
*  I'm just saying that the brain is capable of so much extraordinary thought within itself. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2625.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2631.54s)]
*  That what I care about for the world is what is objectively true. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2632.7s)]
*  What's objectively true can be verified by multiple people. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2638.8199999999997s)]
*  If it's only true within your head, it's not useful, is all I'm saying. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2643.62s)]
*  How could it not be useful? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2649.5s)]
*  To other people. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2650.5s)]
*  It's useful to you. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2651.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2652.5s)]
*  It's useful to you. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2653.5s)]
*  But hold on. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2654.5s)]
*  If it's useful to you and then that usefulness to you actually manifests itself in something [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2655.5s)]
*  that gets created because of this experience. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2661.08s)]
*  Like Carey Mullis created the PCR method because he had an acid trip. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2663.44s)]
*  And during the acid trip came up with this idea. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2669.3199999999997s)]
*  What we'd have to ask is how frequent is that? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2674.72s)]
*  You get everybody who takes trips of any kind. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2678.12s)]
*  Be it mushrooms or acid. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2680.96s)]
*  Look at the body of their new thoughts that have come from them for them having, when [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2685.2s)]
*  they credit it. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2691.64s)]
*  Carl Sagan was a big pothead and highly productive scientist. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  The question is, does it give you some insight which when you are not under the influence [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2700.48s)]
*  gets you closer to an objective reality? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2705.64s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2707.9199999999996s)]
*  Carl Sagan actually believed that there was, the way he described, what was his description, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2709.04s)]
*  the way he described it. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2714.18s)]
*  But he said he believed that there are thoughts that were only available when you were under [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2715.46s)]
*  the influence of marijuana. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2720.1s)]
*  That is certainly the case for any drug. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2721.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2723.2599999999998s)]
*  But he felt like those thoughts were beneficial. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2724.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I can ask, are those thoughts more connected to reality than if you were not so influenced? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2725.66s)]
*  I did an experiment with myself. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2732.18s)]
*  When I first started writing in graduate school at a monthly column, there was that stereotype [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2734.74s)]
*  of Hemingway with a drink, you know, and they're writing and that's their creative moment. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2741.3s)]
*  I said, I don't really like hard liquor, but I like wine. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2747.7400000000002s)]
*  So I said, let me get a bottle of wine and drink wine while I write. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2751.1000000000004s)]
*  And I said, yeah, this is good. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2754.46s)]
*  This is good. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2755.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm doing it. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2756.7400000000002s)]
*  And then I did it without wine. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2758.02s)]
*  This is an experiment. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2762.26s)]
*  I conducted it on myself. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2763.82s)]
*  And it was not as fun, posing without the influence of just some, you know, a smooth [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2765.74s)]
*  sort of low level sort of wine buzz. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2771.74s)]
*  But I looked at the two, there was no contest. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2775.54s)]
*  My completely sober writing was vastly better than what I was writing under the influence [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2779.2599999999998s)]
*  of several glasses of wine. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2785.14s)]
*  Even though I believed it was really good. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2787.2599999999998s)]
*  But hold on a second. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2789.5s)]
*  What kind of writing are you talking about? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2790.5s)]
*  If you're talking about fiction? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2791.98s)]
*  No, no, prose. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2792.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2793.98s)]
*  One of the greatest examples of fiction enhancing, being enhanced rather by under the influence [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2795.3s)]
*  of drugs and chemicals is Stephen King. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2801.5s)]
*  If you go and read Stephen King's early work versus the stuff after he got sober, and I'm [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2804.7400000000002s)]
*  a gigantic Stephen King fan. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2810.42s)]
*  Was it just alcohol in his case or were there other drugs? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2811.98s)]
*  Cocaine. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2814.46s)]
*  Oh, other drugs too. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2815.46s)]
*  A lot of cocaine, a lot of alcohol, cigarettes, a lot of cigarettes. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2816.46s)]
*  It was way better. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2818.78s)]
*  It's vastly superior. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2820.54s)]
*  Darker, deeper, stranger, more bizarre, more shocking. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2821.86s)]
*  In the day, you're saying? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2825.42s)]
*  In the day. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2826.42s)]
*  Read it today. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2827.42s)]
*  Read Carey today. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2828.42s)]
*  No, no, no, no, I meant you're saying what he created in the day under that influence [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2829.42s)]
*  is way... [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, the stuff under the influence, the stuff he created under the influence. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2832.7799999999997s)]
*  Carey is deeply dark. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2834.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2835.7799999999997s)]
*  It's so dark. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2836.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2837.7799999999997s)]
*  It's so dark. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2838.7799999999997s)]
*  So was Shawshank. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2839.7799999999997s)]
*  Pet cemetery, almost all of them. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2840.7799999999997s)]
*  When was Shawshank Redemption? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2841.7799999999997s)]
*  I think all of them were when he was fucked up. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2842.7799999999997s)]
*  He wrote some good stuff after he was fucked up. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2845.02s)]
*  But like Cujo, he doesn't even remember writing it. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2847.74s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2850.18s)]
*  So is this something you would recommend for creative people? [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2851.66s)]
*  I recommended Stephen King. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2855.9s)]
*  Get back on coke, sir. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2857.2999999999997s)]
*  Stay off Twitter. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2858.94s)]
*  Get back on coke. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2859.94s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2860.94s)]
*  So my one little experiment with glasses of wine... [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2861.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's not enough. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2865.1s)]
*  That experiment's not enough. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2866.24s)]
*  I personally feel that under the influence of marijuana, I come up with some of my best [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2867.86s)]
*  ideas for comedy, for standup comedy writing. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2872.54s)]
*  I like to... [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2875.38s)]
*  I do the George Carlin method. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2876.38s)]
*  I hear you got a new show ready to drop. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2877.38s)]
*  I'm looking forward to that. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2878.38s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2879.38s)]
*  I love your work, by the way. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2880.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2881.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2882.38s)]
*  I do the George Carlin method. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2883.38s)]
*  I write sober and then I punch it up high. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2884.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2885.38s)]
*  And sometimes I just write high. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2886.38s)]
*  As opposed to the opposite. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2887.38s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2888.38s)]
*  Well, George Carlin had a great point. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2889.38s)]
*  He's like, you should write about things that you're thinking about and things that are [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2890.38s)]
*  like important or things that are on your mind. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2893.38s)]
*  And then he would like let it sit and then he would smoke pot and go back to it. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2896.9s)]
*  And then he would come up all the funny. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2901.1800000000003s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2902.94s)]
*  And then he would go into the miraculous aspects of it and he would interject them into there. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2903.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2907.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2908.5s)]
*  So, I'm just saying to the extent... [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2909.5s)]
*  I'd like to know how reliable that is. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2912.14s)]
*  Well, here's the other point that I should say. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2915.14s)]
*  There's many people that don't do any drugs that write fantastic stuff. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2917.7000000000003s)]
*  And there's many comedians that are completely clean and sober that have done their best [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2923.1s)]
*  work once they got clean and sober. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2927.2200000000003s)]
*  That's true too. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2929.7400000000002s)]
*  Both those things are true. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2930.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2931.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think they're tools. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2932.7400000000002s)]
*  I've lost some comedians. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2934.54s)]
*  I mean, Mitch Hedberg, for example, one of my favorites. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2935.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2938.54s)]
*  So, Mitch was a genius. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2939.54s)]
*  But he was very... [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2940.54s)]
*  I really loved his stuff. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2941.54s)]
*  And he had a really bad drug. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2942.54s)]
*  His injectable heroin was his thing, which is one of the worst. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2943.54s)]
*  But the point is it's like they're tools. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2947.62s)]
*  And I used to have a joke about it, like that marijuana is like any other tool. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2951.7s)]
*  It's like a hammer. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2955.12s)]
*  You could build a house with a hammer or you could hit yourself in the dick if you're fucking [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2956.18s)]
*  crazy. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2959.22s)]
*  And that's the problem with all sorts of things. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2960.22s)]
*  They need to be managed responsibly and people need to understand what the effects are, what [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2962.98s)]
*  the dosage is. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2967.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's where science comes in. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2968.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay, here's what I'll do. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2969.7400000000002s)]
*  Here's what I'll do. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2970.7400000000002s)]
*  I still have some writing projects that I'm going to finish. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2971.7400000000002s)]
*  You're going to take mushrooms? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2975.7400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2976.7400000000002s)]
*  When I'm done with what I know I wanted to write before I died, then I will consider [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2977.7400000000002s)]
*  this. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2983.78s)]
*  Then come to daddy. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2984.78s)]
*  I'll come to papa. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2985.78s)]
*  I'll come to papa. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2986.78s)]
*  We'll hook you up. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2987.78s)]
*  If some new creative thing comes out of me at that point. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2989.5800000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't know if new creative things will come out of you, but I think I already [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2992.86s)]
*  got stuff. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2996.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean, I'm good. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2997.5400000000004s)]
*  Will come out that probably wouldn't exist without them. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=2998.5400000000004s)]
*  And when you're talking about like really breakthrough psychedelic moments like DMT [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3002.86s)]
*  or mushroom psilocybin, one of the really fascinating things is they mimic neurochemistry. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3009.38s)]
*  DMT is in the brain and it's in all the organs and it's a part of natural human neurochemistry. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3015.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, except of course, so is fentanyl. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3023.38s)]
*  Fentanyl is a part of the neurochemistry? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3025.38s)]
*  No, no. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3027.38s)]
*  You have receptors for it. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3028.38s)]
*  Right, but DMT is produced by the human body. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3029.38s)]
*  It's actually a thing that the body makes. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3032.54s)]
*  We don't know why. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3034.66s)]
*  And the really heavy duty psychedelic people think that in large doses when you take it [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3036.1s)]
*  and have these breakthrough experiences, what you're doing is you're going through some [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3042.38s)]
*  sort of chemical portal. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3047.26s)]
*  And this chemical portal is only available to people in these near death experiences [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3049.5s)]
*  under extreme moments of stress where they have like these moments where they go through [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3053.86s)]
*  the tunnel and the bright light and they meet God. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3057.9s)]
*  I mean, how many of these would I have to see to be convinced that it's a reliable consequence [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3060.78s)]
*  of it? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3066.78s)]
*  I think you would have to do it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3067.78s)]
*  This conversation is like talking to a person who's lived in an underground tunnel their [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3069.46s)]
*  whole life who's dismissing sunlight. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3073.9s)]
*  They're like, what's the big deal with sunlight? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3076.26s)]
*  I'm fine down here with light bulbs and you and your sunlight. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3078.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, photosynthesis. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3083.94s)]
*  I've got hydroponics. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3087.78s)]
*  So you're being a very effective drug pusher. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3089.6200000000003s)]
*  But the drugs that I'm interested in are not dangerous. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3094.6200000000003s)]
*  They're not ones that kill you. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3097.94s)]
*  Like I've never done cocaine. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3099.2200000000003s)]
*  I've never done heroin. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3100.66s)]
*  I've never done amphetamines. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3101.82s)]
*  I'm not interested in those. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3102.98s)]
*  Does cocaine kill you? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3103.98s)]
*  It can. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3104.98s)]
*  It can if you're rich enough. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3105.98s)]
*  Well, it certainly can kill you today because so much of it is laced with fentanyl, which [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3106.98s)]
*  is one of the number one killers of young people, unfortunately, is fentanyl contamination [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3113.5s)]
*  of drugs. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3118.3s)]
*  But I'm interested in pharmacology. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3119.86s)]
*  I'm interested in what happens to the mind when it's under the influence of different [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3122.82s)]
*  substances. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3128.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I'm less interested because I have to think more about what you said. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3129.2200000000003s)]
*  But look at how people misinterpret reality when they're not on anything. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3136.54s)]
*  It's a good point. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3143.78s)]
*  And another good point is there's many people that under the influence of those drugs. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3144.78s)]
*  The failure of eyewitness testimony just to say what actually happened. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3147.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3150.38s)]
*  And that's under extreme duress. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3151.38s)]
*  They end up in jail because of that. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3152.94s)]
*  Yes, for the rest of their lives. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3153.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3154.94s)]
*  Well, listen, I've had many, many conversations with people on this podcast about that because [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3155.94s)]
*  I've worked with my friend Josh Dubin, who was originally an ambassador for the Innocence [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3160.02s)]
*  Project and has done a bunch of stuff on his own where he's gotten many, many, many people [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3165.1400000000003s)]
*  out of jail. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3170.6600000000003s)]
*  The fact that an Innocence Project even has to exist in this world is itself a travesty. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3171.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm hoping that with science, there's going to come a time where we can actually [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3176.6600000000003s)]
*  read the contents of people's minds and that this will no longer be, I remember this. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3182.26s)]
*  It's an episode of Black Mirror. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3188.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3189.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3190.98s)]
*  But I think maybe, yes, that would be interesting. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3191.98s)]
*  But isn't the problem is that false memories are a real thing. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3195.1000000000004s)]
*  So there are people who believe something and if you read their mind, you'll just see [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3197.9s)]
*  what it is that they believe. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3202.28s)]
*  But I wonder if you could sort of back engineer that belief. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3204.26s)]
*  I wonder if it could get to the point where you could say, oh, you believe this because [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3208.78s)]
*  this is a memory of the way you've described the memory. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3213.02s)]
*  Black Mirror style and you have a chip that records everything that you see. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3216.86s)]
*  That's probably the future. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3221.94s)]
*  There's a chapter here called Law and Order where I get into the role of science in deciding [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3222.94s)]
*  whether someone is guilty or innocent. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3232.02s)]
*  It's the idea that in a courtroom, someone says, I need a witness. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3235.98s)]
*  This is like in the court of science, that's the last thing you are ever asking for because [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3240.62s)]
*  we know, psychologists knew this first. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3247.06s)]
*  The rest of us figured it out after the fact that I would just testimony is one of the [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3249.7s)]
*  least reliable forms. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3254.8199999999997s)]
*  The third time I was rejected from jury duty, I show up dutifully. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3257.86s)]
*  The third time they said there was a woman who was robbed on the street of her groceries [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3267.86s)]
*  and her purse and had the person who she accuses positively identifies and her. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3272.46s)]
*  It's a literal he said, she said. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3282.6200000000003s)]
*  We read the particulars of the case. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3285.58s)]
*  She said he robbed her, the groceries took it and then ran off. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3287.98s)]
*  The cops found the guy. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3291.7s)]
*  He was not in possession of anything she said he took. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3293.5s)]
*  They looked in the area if anything stashed in dumpsters. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3296.38s)]
*  They didn't find anything. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3298.5s)]
*  That's the state of the case. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3301.2999999999997s)]
*  The judge reads the particulars and goes to the last 15. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3303.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm almost on a jury for the first time. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3308.42s)]
*  I'm almost there. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3311.06s)]
*  Does anyone think they would not be able to convict based on the kind of information [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3314.86s)]
*  and evidence that's been presented? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3319.5s)]
*  And there's a juror, 14, whatever you're numbered, right, until you're selected. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3322.06s)]
*  Would you have any problem? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3329.42s)]
*  I said yes, I'd have a problem. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3330.42s)]
*  If the only evidence available is eyewitness testimony, then everything I know about it [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3333.58s)]
*  I should not trust it on the level where you end up putting someone in jail. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3343.1800000000003s)]
*  So I could not convict if that's the only evidence you have. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3347.5s)]
*  What the judge said next was, are there any other jurors like juror 14 who said who needs [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3351.94s)]
*  more than one witness before they would be able to convict? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3360.3s)]
*  And I said, should I jump in now and say that's not what I said? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3366.86s)]
*  What should I do? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3370.82s)]
*  The person in front of me said, your honor, that's not what he said. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3371.98s)]
*  And I said, thank you, thank you Jesus. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3378.7400000000002s)]
*  That's not what he said. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3383.1000000000004s)]
*  And I resisted with all my might to say, your honor, you were eyewitness to what I said [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3384.6200000000003s)]
*  20 seconds ago and got it wrong. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3391.98s)]
*  But I resisted, but I was nonetheless on the street 20 minutes later. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3396.06s)]
*  I think you should have said that just for his own edification. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3399.66s)]
*  No, it was a she, by the way. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3401.8199999999997s)]
*  She, sorry, I'm sexist. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3402.8199999999997s)]
*  You're totally sexist. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3404.2999999999997s)]
*  What's wrong with me? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3405.2999999999997s)]
*  We've all known that forever. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3406.2999999999997s)]
*  I slapped myself on the wrist. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3407.2999999999997s)]
*  So I'm just saying it's clear that the legal system, the precision of... [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3410.54s)]
*  Deeply flawed. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3416.8199999999997s)]
*  It's deeply flawed. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3417.8199999999997s)]
*  And they say, well, it's the best we have. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3418.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, then fix it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3420.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3421.02s)]
*  I mean, if that's how you were talking when they used to dunk people and if you died face [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3422.02s)]
*  up, you were innocent and died face down, you were guilty. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3424.54s)]
*  That was the best they had then, but we improved on it. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3428.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3431.42s)]
*  If they drowned you, you weren't a witch. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3432.42s)]
*  Congratulations, you weren't guilty. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3434.1s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3435.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3436.38s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3437.38s)]
*  How you died and you'd otherwise go to heaven. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3438.38s)]
*  So plus there's... [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3441.66s)]
*  In Columbus's voyage, there's a lot. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3446.22s)]
*  We talked about Columbus last time on the show. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3448.54s)]
*  Oh, I talked about Columbus many times. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3450.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3451.98s)]
*  It's horrific. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3452.98s)]
*  In one of the voyages, they went on some stretch of time and they didn't have food and they [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3454.46s)]
*  had Indians that they brought on board as well as some of their own crew. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3460.3s)]
*  And people were dying. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3467.14s)]
*  And so at sea, what do you do with a dead body? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3468.9s)]
*  You throw it overboard, of course. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3471.38s)]
*  So a person who's keeping notes said all the Indians they threw overboard floated face [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3473.7s)]
*  down and all the Christians floated face up. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3481.98s)]
*  Oh, Christ. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3484.62s)]
*  So I said, okay. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3485.62s)]
*  I guess that could happen. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3488.62s)]
*  Statistically, perhaps. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3490.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3493.2200000000003s)]
*  But now we have his handwritten notes, eyewitness testimony of something that is completely [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3495.1s)]
*  fulfilling his own worldview's expectations of how things should be. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3500.66s)]
*  In the whole sort of law and order chapter, I just pick all that apart and just try to [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3508.66s)]
*  say why not have jurors that are really good at data analysis? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3514.1s)]
*  How about that? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3518.2599999999998s)]
*  That would be nice, but that's really hard to find. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3519.5s)]
*  And then on top of that, if you are dealing with eyewitness testimony, what do you do? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3521.8999999999996s)]
*  Do you just throw everything out completely or do you try to assess whether or not that [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3525.8999999999996s)]
*  person is capable of objective thought and reasoning? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3530.74s)]
*  No. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3533.7s)]
*  Because even people who are better at it are still flawed at it. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3534.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3537.8999999999996s)]
*  Especially under experiences under extreme stress. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3538.8999999999996s)]
*  Stress experience. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3541.46s)]
*  Correct. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3542.46s)]
*  As they've done many times in psychology class, they have classes unfolding and they stage [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3543.46s)]
*  some violent thing with an explosion and then they say, write what you just saw. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3548.4199999999996s)]
*  And nothing agrees. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3553.7799999999997s)]
*  So yeah, it's a challenge. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3556.1s)]
*  Which is the problem of conspiracy theories after big events like 9-11. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3558.2999999999997s)]
*  Like all the people that say they saw this and they saw that and I remember this and [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3562.98s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3566.34s)]
*  Correct. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3567.34s)]
*  And you have these little sound bites of all these people and you piece them together and [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3568.34s)]
*  they're like, oh my god, they planted bombs. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3570.02s)]
*  And there are also people who say before an earthquake. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3572.62s)]
*  They knew what was going to happen. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3579.34s)]
*  They say they see all the animals running. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3580.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3582.34s)]
*  And it's like, okay, you reported that after the earthquake happened, not like before. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3583.34s)]
*  But doesn't that happen during tsunamis? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3587.42s)]
*  Do animals actually do go to higher ground? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3590.14s)]
*  I think that has actually been documented. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3593.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3595.3399999999997s)]
*  I believe that happened. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3596.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm highly suspicious of whether that's true. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3597.3399999999997s)]
*  Because a tsunami, there's no way to know that. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3602.2599999999998s)]
*  Tsunami typically occurs from an earthquake way offshore. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3606.7s)]
*  And it's a very low amplitude wave in deep water that continues to gain amplitude as [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3610.42s)]
*  the water gets shallower and shallower. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3618.34s)]
*  So that's why waves get bigger when they crash on the shores. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3620.7400000000002s)]
*  So as it comes to the shore. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3623.2200000000003s)]
*  So if you're just an animal in the woods, if you're not on the shoreline, there's no [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3624.6600000000003s)]
*  way to know that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3630.86s)]
*  I think they were talking about animals on islands and animals that do live closer to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3631.94s)]
*  the shore. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3637.46s)]
*  And maybe there's an indication because the water pulls back before a tsunami. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3638.46s)]
*  Sure. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3641.5s)]
*  I can recognize that. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3642.5s)]
*  I don't know if there's an animal somewhere onshore away from the coast. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3643.5s)]
*  I don't really see that. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3648.26s)]
*  I need to see very good evidence for that and not just someone's account. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3649.66s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know if they're talking about it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3653.66s)]
*  This is my whole point. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3655.26s)]
*  The people have accounts of all kinds of things. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3656.26s)]
*  Do you know, in the, there's a whole other chapter called risk and reward. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3658.78s)]
*  All right. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3664.54s)]
*  Here's something. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3665.54s)]
*  Surely in your life, you have taken an average of numbers before. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3667.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3670.06s)]
*  Tell me yes. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3671.06s)]
*  Sure. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3672.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3673.62s)]
*  Do you realize that the first time anyone ever did that to realize that maybe there's [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3674.62s)]
*  some interesting result here was after the invention of algebra, trigonometry, geometry [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3682.2599999999998s)]
*  and calculus. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3692.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3694.1s)]
*  Statistics is just something that the human brain, it's just not natural. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3695.94s)]
*  It is completely foreign to us. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3702.54s)]
*  We don't know how to interpret simple random events because we want to give meaning to [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3705.94s)]
*  them. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3712.18s)]
*  You know the thing where you're in some other country in some other city and you meet someone [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3713.18s)]
*  like a childhood friend. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3717.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3718.34s)]
*  And you say, small world. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3719.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3720.34s)]
*  That's your first thought. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3721.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3722.34s)]
*  Small world. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3723.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3724.34s)]
*  Here's how to cure that. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3725.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3726.34s)]
*  Next time you're in a foreign city, go up to every single person you walk by and say, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3727.34s)]
*  do I know you? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3732.5s)]
*  And they'll probably say no. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3734.22s)]
*  I mean, no, you personally, they'll know you because you're dude, but they know you personally. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3735.54s)]
*  No, just keep doing this. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3740.38s)]
*  And if they say, no, I don't know you, then say, big world. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3742.9s)]
*  Just do that. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3747.38s)]
*  You'll do that millions of times. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3748.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3751.18s)]
*  Before you meet someone who you once knew. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3752.18s)]
*  And the proper statistics will then get recorded for that. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3756.42s)]
*  So no, it's not a small world. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3761.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a fucking big world. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3762.3399999999997s)]
*  And there are a lot of people in it who you don't know. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3763.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just very unusual when you meet someone in another country that you know from back [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3766.66s)]
*  home. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3770.58s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3771.58s)]
*  There's a point where, well, if you do the math, there are a lot of things that people [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3772.58s)]
*  say are unusual where it would be unusual if you didn't. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3774.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, if you fly to England and you don't tell anybody you're flying to England and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3778.02s)]
*  you run into a friend from back home, that's pretty unusual. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3783.8199999999997s)]
*  Look how often people say that it happens. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3789.46s)]
*  Well, we live in a strange world now. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3791.6600000000003s)]
*  That's precisely my point. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3794.06s)]
*  Everybody you know has that story. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3796.06s)]
*  If you run the statistics on it, it would be odd if you went your life. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3798.58s)]
*  Presumably, you have a normal life and you know people and your school was big and all [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3803.86s)]
*  of this. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3807.7000000000003s)]
*  You didn't grow up in a farm with nobody. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3808.7000000000003s)]
*  You didn't know anybody. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3812.62s)]
*  It requires some basic number of people. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3813.62s)]
*  So there's a lot of errors of statistics that we make of probability and statistics. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3816.54s)]
*  The sad part of it is there's an entire industry that has risen to exploit that fact and they're [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3824.7799999999997s)]
*  called casinos. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3831.62s)]
*  The fact that you could go to a roulette table and somebody's got a lot of money on seven. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3833.2599999999998s)]
*  I said, why do you have money on seven? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3836.66s)]
*  It's due. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3838.18s)]
*  What do you mean it's due? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3839.18s)]
*  Well, look at the previous rolls because they'll show you the previous rolls and seven hasn't [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3840.18s)]
*  appeared in 20 rolls or whatever the numbers they put. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3844.42s)]
*  So it's due. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3847.7000000000003s)]
*  No, it's not due. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3848.7000000000003s)]
*  This is a failure of the human brain to understand and interpret probability and statistics. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3850.42s)]
*  There are people who are going to roll dice. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3856.02s)]
*  If they need a low number, they'll take the dice and like gently roll them. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3858.98s)]
*  So if they need a high number, they'll throw them hard. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3862.38s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3865.62s)]
*  But those people are suckers. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3866.62s)]
*  There's other people that do understand statistics and they kick them out of casinos because [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3871.34s)]
*  they count cards. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3875.46s)]
*  Only for those that are not purely random like a roulette table or dice. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3877.1000000000004s)]
*  You mean things like blackjack. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3881.5s)]
*  Correct. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3883.7000000000003s)]
*  You can tilt the odds in your favor a little bit and be systematic about it. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3884.7000000000003s)]
*  But I'm talking about pure probabilities. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3888.86s)]
*  The fact that someone thinks that a number is due is itself. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3891.34s)]
*  Do you realize the American Physical Society, these are my physics peeps. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3896.94s)]
*  It's our physics society. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3900.9s)]
*  1986, they were going to have their annual meeting in San Diego and there was a hotel [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3902.7400000000002s)]
*  snafu so they had to reschedule. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3907.86s)]
*  And so Vegas said, we'll take you. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3910.2200000000003s)]
*  The MGM Marina, which became the MGM Grand, we'll take you. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3912.8s)]
*  Four thousand physicists said, okay. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3916.1s)]
*  Four thousand physicists had their annual meeting in Las Vegas. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3919.54s)]
*  And let me tell you, okay. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3924.34s)]
*  K through 12, is there even a course offered in probability and statistics? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3928.46s)]
*  You learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3933.6s)]
*  Not reading, writing, and probability and statistics. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3936.34s)]
*  It's kind of not there. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3939.58s)]
*  And if it's there, it's an elective. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3940.58s)]
*  So as a scientist, especially as a physical scientist, I take some form of probability [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3943.78s)]
*  and statistics every single year I am in school. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3950.18s)]
*  And nuances and how data can be looked at and analyzed and put together and averaged. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3954.74s)]
*  The average that I told you about, you add numbers, divide by the, that's one of a dozen [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3960.06s)]
*  kind of ways you can average numbers. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3964.22s)]
*  There are other ways. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3966.2999999999997s)]
*  You can have a statistically weighted average. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3967.2999999999997s)]
*  It depends on the needs, depends on the situation. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3969.2799999999997s)]
*  Point is, the physicist came to Vegas. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3971.8399999999997s)]
*  One week later, there was a news headline, physicists in town, lowest casino take ever. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3974.9399999999996s)]
*  Were told to never return to Vegas. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3984.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3987.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes! [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3988.2599999999998s)]
*  They were told to never return? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3989.2599999999998s)]
*  They were told. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3990.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, that might be apocryphal, but it was in the headline. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3991.2599999999998s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3993.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3994.02s)]
*  So, that's funny. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=3995.02s)]

*  By selling tickets to the buffet? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4013.42s)]

*  No. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4078.86s)]
*  It goes to education. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4079.86s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4080.86s)]

*  Okay. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4094.7s)]

*  Please do. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4100.7s)]
*  I'll give you all the ones you want. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4101.7s)]
*  I love a good conspiracy. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4102.7s)]
*  The conspiracy is they have to make sure that the school curriculum does not teach probability [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4103.7s)]
*  statistics. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4110.26s)]
*  What? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4111.26s)]
*  What? [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4112.26s)]
*  Because if they did. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4113.26s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4114.26s)]
*  If they did, then no one would play the lottery. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4115.26s)]
*  So they allocate money to education with a specific mandate that you can't. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4117.26s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4123.7s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4124.7s)]
*  Yes, I'm saying that. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4125.7s)]
*  No, I'm just saying it's a little suspicious that the very knowledge of math that would [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4126.7s)]
*  undermine the ability of the state lottery to make money is not a required part of the [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4143.38s)]
*  math curriculum in kindergarten through 12. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4151.54s)]
*  But you don't think that's why. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4155.82s)]
*  I'm just playing with the, no, I don't really think that's why. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4157.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4161.14s)]
*  Okay, so I see what you were doing there. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4162.14s)]
*  You were assuming that I was totally in on this conspiracy theory and I have charts on [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4164.7s)]
*  my wall and websites devoted to it. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4170.0199999999995s)]
*  No, it just crossed my mind how odd it is that when you know enough about probability [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4172.26s)]
*  you bet less. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4179.06s)]
*  And when you bet less, the revenue to the state would drop and that's the revenue that [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4180.92s)]
*  would go to education. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4185.22s)]
*  So it has the power to plant the seeds of its own undoing. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4186.900000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't do that. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4194.38s)]
*  So I'm intrigued by that fact. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4195.860000000001s)]
*  Just removing ourselves from the conspiracy theory aspect of it, do you think that it [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4197.820000000001s)]
*  would be beneficial to teach probability and statistics to people? [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4201.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4205.22s)]
*  Look at how many bad decisions we make because we think we have an understanding of what [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4207.14s)]
*  is random and what is not. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4213.860000000001s)]
*  What is a, there's the one, they did this but actually their analysis was flawed but [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4215.9800000000005s)]
*  the basis was well placed. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4222.740000000001s)]
*  So the idea, you're playing a basketball game and somebody hits a few shots in a row, they've [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4227.18s)]
*  got a hot hand, give it to them. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4231.58s)]
*  They don't have a hot hand. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4233.900000000001s)]
*  It is the natural consequence. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4235.58s)]
*  If you're shooting 50% in a game or 40% and you take, I don't know how many shots, you [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4239.58s)]
*  take 30 shots, you can look at the probability that you'll have multiple shots in a row that [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4245.339999999999s)]
*  are made. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4252.259999999999s)]
*  And it's very high and it's very real. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4254.099999999999s)]
*  But do you discount? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4256.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's not something special happening. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4257.0599999999995s)]
*  It is the randomness of the statistics that's happening. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4259.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, but this is talking about statistics but from an individual basis. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4261.98s)]
*  Do you discount the idea that sometimes people feel really good and they have a very good [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4265.419999999999s)]
*  sense of where the ball's going, where they're more loose or relaxed or more practiced, whatever [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4271.62s)]
*  it may be, and they're more accurate because of that? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4277.74s)]
*  If that's the case, no, so people have good days, right? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4281.419999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4286.179999999999s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4287.179999999999s)]
*  That's why that original analysis was slightly flawed. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4288.42s)]
*  Because a person can have more than what is typical shots in a row. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4291.3s)]
*  And for that game, you could look at their data and they would make 60% of the shots [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4296.42s)]
*  instead of 40% of the shots. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4301.22s)]
*  And if you make 60% of the shots, you then expect three in a row here, six in a row there, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4303.18s)]
*  five in a row here. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4308.38s)]
*  In the random expression of having a 60% success rate in a basket, you expect intervals where [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4311.66s)]
*  you make multiple shots in a row. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4321.54s)]
*  That's my only point. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4323.5s)]
*  And that could be a good day for you because you're shooting 60%. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4324.5s)]
*  And I want to recognize that. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4327.62s)]
*  I'm going to hand you the ball if you're having a good day. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4329.22s)]
*  You can totally have a good day. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4331.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you're not sinking 20 here and none before it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4333.78s)]
*  No. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4339.42s)]
*  And statistics maintain themselves in the game, unless you get injured or something, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4340.42s)]
*  of course. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4344.82s)]
*  But my point is, we have such... [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4345.82s)]
*  And I don't want to blame people for this. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4348.82s)]
*  If it was natural to think statistically about the world, it would have been the first branches [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4351.22s)]
*  of math we would have ever discovered. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4355.1s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4357.74s)]
*  It was like 1753. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4358.74s)]
*  It sounds like a long time ago. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4359.74s)]
*  But it's 50 years after calculus was invented. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4361.9400000000005s)]
*  After calculus, which is not even taught in school. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4366.02s)]
*  Not long ago at all, really. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4367.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a simple paper on the benefits of taking the mean, mean is average, of observations [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4370.54s)]
*  in astronomical data. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4378.219999999999s)]
*  This is what astronomer did it. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4379.58s)]

*  And this is just... [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4383.82s)]
*  So that tells me we are victims of our own brain wiring. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4385.82s)]
*  And it takes many years to undo that wiring or to see through it so that you are not... [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4391.459999999999s)]
*  It prevents you from seeing other things, okay? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4400.0599999999995s)]
*  How so? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4402.62s)]
*  Do you realize last year, we lost as many people in the United States to traffic accidents [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4403.62s)]
*  as we did in all the years we fought in Vietnam? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4412.86s)]
*  Look at the effort we put up as a country beginning maybe 1967, certainly 68, to stop [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4417.46s)]
*  the carnage. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4425.54s)]
*  And that's just the American deaths, not to mention the millions of deaths of the Vietnamese [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4427.34s)]
*  themselves, North and South. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4430.7s)]
*  Point is, our reactions to statistics are very different depending on what caused it. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4432.74s)]
*  And I'm intrigued by that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4441.42s)]
*  I don't have a good understanding of it. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4442.78s)]
*  Any laws that treat it are going to have to fold in people's emotions. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4446.46s)]
*  Here's an example. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4451.78s)]
*  You shoot deer with your bow and arrow. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4454.419999999999s)]
*  There's a certain number of deer deaths and human deaths by cars hitting deer in the roads, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4457.379999999999s)]
*  especially in suburban, rural places, okay? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4463.379999999999s)]
*  What do you do about this? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4467.98s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4470.0199999999995s)]
*  Get a truck with a big ass bumper. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4471.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what they do out here. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4473.0199999999995s)]
*  The Joe Rogan solution. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4476.0199999999995s)]
*  That's the Texas solution. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4477.0199999999995s)]
*  You ever see those guys that work on ranchers? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4478.0199999999995s)]
*  Make sure your truck has significantly more mass than the deer. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4481.38s)]
*  They have specific bumpers that they build to save people's lives. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4485.38s)]
*  Of course, this is what the old locomotives had if there were cattle on the... [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4491.5s)]
*  You ever see that pointy front on locomotives? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4495.860000000001s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4498.02s)]
*  That was the pry cattle on it, so it wouldn't roll over the cow and derail the thing. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4499.02s)]
*  What do you do? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4505.26s)]
*  Do you accept the 100 deaths a year in your county, whatever, human deaths? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4506.74s)]
*  No one's counting deer deaths here, right? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4512.26s)]
*  Or do you find something... [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4515.1s)]
*  Get yourself a big ass bumper. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4516.1s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4517.1s)]
*  Big ass bumper. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4518.1s)]
*  Deer killer bumpers. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4519.1s)]
*  Look at those suckers. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4520.1s)]
*  I like the Ford F-250 right there. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4521.1s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4522.1s)]
*  Look at that one. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4523.1s)]
*  The Ford F-250, that red one, that's what I'm talking about. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4524.1s)]
*  The problem is if the center of mass of the deer is above the level of that bumper... [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4526.74s)]
*  But it's not. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4532.46s)]
*  Well, for elk it would be. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4533.46s)]
*  For moose it would be. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4534.86s)]
*  My wife grew up in Alaska. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4536.06s)]
*  No. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4537.660000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4538.660000000001s)]
*  No, not a 250. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4539.660000000001s)]
*  F-250? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4540.660000000001s)]
*  Center of mass of an elk? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4541.660000000001s)]
*  Moose. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4542.660000000001s)]
*  Moose, yes. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4543.660000000001s)]
*  Moose is a different thing. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4544.660000000001s)]
*  I saw moose. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4547.46s)]
*  Glad my wife grew up in Alaska. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4548.46s)]
*  When you see them for the first time, you're like, how is that real? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4549.46s)]
*  The first time I saw moose, I was in British Columbia and I saw it, it was like the scene [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4554.46s)]
*  in Jurassic Park where Jeff Goldblum gets out of the Jeep and he's like... [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4559.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4563.860000000001s)]
*  Who invented that? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4565.179999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4566.179999999999s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4567.179999999999s)]
*  Right, so if you're under the center of mass then it will just roll up and crush your windshield. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4568.179999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4571.179999999999s)]
*  So you have to watch out for that. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4572.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, it will go through your windshield. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4573.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4574.179999999999s)]
*  It's horrific. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4575.179999999999s)]
*  So here's my point. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4576.179999999999s)]
*  There is a group, I forgot where, somewhere in New England who did a study. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4577.179999999999s)]
*  And the study was if you have 100 deaths a year, we can drop that to maybe 30 deaths [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4581.74s)]
*  a year. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4588.219999999999s)]
*  How? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4589.219999999999s)]
*  By introducing the natural cat predator to the deer. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4590.34s)]
*  So it would be like the puma or bobcat, one of these sort of mid-sized cats that hold [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4597.780000000001s)]
*  the deer as their quarry. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4602.26s)]
*  And they ran some models of how this would go. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4605.9800000000005s)]
*  And you could drop the number of human deaths by a factor of three, okay? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4609.9800000000005s)]
*  Because still some deer would wander onto the road. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4616.54s)]
*  But you'll lose about 10 children a year. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4620.38s)]
*  They'll just snatch your kid out of the backyard and eat your child. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4626.5s)]
*  So look at these numbers. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4631.34s)]
*  You killed 100 people in their cars or the deer killed 30 people plus 10 children. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4632.58s)]
*  No, no, the deer killed 30 people, the bobcat kills 10. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4640.1s)]
*  The bobcat might kill an adult, not bobcat, but whatever is the next mountain lion, or [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4645.06s)]
*  whatever was native in the region long ago. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4649.620000000001s)]
*  And so they did a study. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4653.22s)]
*  And the point is you could not bring that suggestion forward. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4655.34s)]
*  Because the government would be introducing an animal that killed your children, but no [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4661.5s)]
*  one's looking at the 100 people that were, whatever the numbers were, it was a factor [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4666.860000000001s)]
*  of three or so. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4670.72s)]
*  Do you know there's another solution? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4671.72s)]
*  The correct numbers are in the book. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4672.860000000001s)]
*  I'm just giving this as an example of we're not equipped to fold our emotions with the [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4674.58s)]
*  data to arrive at a solution that would save the most lives. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4684.14s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4690.7s)]
*  There is a technological solution that they've come up with. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4692.46s)]
*  There's a device that they put at the front of the car that makes a very certain sound [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4695.06s)]
*  that alerts deer to the presence. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4700.9s)]
*  On the edges of the... [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4702.98s)]
*  I've heard about that, but I read about it 20 years ago, so I haven't heard much about [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4704.86s)]
*  it since. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4709.58s)]
*  I don't know how effective it is. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4710.58s)]
*  The air going through it makes a kind of a siren effect. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4712.139999999999s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4714.74s)]
*  Yeah, when I last remembered it. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4715.74s)]
*  Well, whatever it is, it develops some sort of a sound that the deer can hear and they [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4717.62s)]
*  avoid it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4721.98s)]
*  But they have a problem with headlights. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4722.98s)]
*  I was in Alaska and there was a deer and a grizzly bear, must have been 300 yards away, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4725.9s)]
*  way down in the valley. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4735.82s)]
*  And the deer noticed it. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4737.86s)]
*  And it was eating, but it was eating very cautiously, always looking to the bear. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4740.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm saying, if it could notice a bear 300 yards and be cautious of it, why can't [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4744.62s)]
*  it know a Ford 250 barreling down a road? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4752.099999999999s)]
*  Because it's not natural. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4754.82s)]
*  Well, figure it out! [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4755.82s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4756.82s)]
*  It's got a mammal, it's got a brain. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4757.82s)]
*  That takes forever. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4759.42s)]
*  Let me get angry with the bear for a second. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4760.42s)]
*  And how come we haven't killed all the stupid deer by now, so the ones that are left are [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4763.66s)]
*  the ones that recognize that cars kill them? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4767.7s)]
*  Because they're all stupid. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4770.299999999999s)]
*  They just have really good senses. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4771.299999999999s)]
*  And I heard someone just... [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4773.78s)]
*  They have senses that are designed to avoid predation. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4774.78s)]
*  But they're living with us now. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4776.78s)]
*  But how long have they had headlights? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4779.9s)]
*  Mice and rats figured out how to coexist with humans. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4780.9s)]
*  Rats are very intelligent. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4783.7s)]
*  They figured this out. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4785.58s)]
*  Yeah, but deer don't know what to do with headlights and cars. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4786.58s)]
*  It's a completely unnatural thing. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4790.0199999999995s)]
*  So everyone that doesn't, they die. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4791.46s)]
*  And the ones that have a little bit of genetic variation that figures it out, they'll survive. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4793.42s)]
*  Sort of. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4798.099999999999s)]
*  Because then they get horny. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4799.099999999999s)]
*  The problem with deer is, if you look at the number of deaths... [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4800.099999999999s)]
*  Sorry, I don't know anything about the sex life of deer. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4803.0599999999995s)]
*  I do. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4804.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4805.5s)]
*  One of the things that happens... [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4806.5s)]
*  Don't tell me how you know they're going. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4807.5s)]
*  The uptick... [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4808.5s)]
*  Well, the rut. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4809.5s)]
*  When deer rut is when you hunt them. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4810.5s)]
*  And one of the things that happens during the rut is they get ridiculous. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4812.9800000000005s)]
*  And they just run out into traffic. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4815.7s)]
*  They can't even control themselves. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4816.7s)]
*  They chase does into the street. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4817.7s)]
*  That's oftentimes does. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4819.7s)]
*  The male deer chase the female deer. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4820.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4822.14s)]
*  Because they're just chasing them. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4823.14s)]
*  The females are just trying to get away. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4824.14s)]
*  And they just run out into traffic. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4825.14s)]
*  That happens. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4826.58s)]
*  Or the male is trying to chase the female. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4827.58s)]
*  And all he's got on his mind is he's got tunnel vision. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4829.32s)]
*  And they just boom. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4832.12s)]
*  Gets hit by that F-250. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4833.5s)]
*  Speaking of deer... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4835.5s)]
*  By the way, my sister drives an F-250. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4836.5s)]
*  Or is it a 450? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4838.5s)]
*  Is there a 450? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4840.7s)]
*  No, it's a 350. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4842.0599999999995s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4843.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, she has a dually? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4844.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, she's got one where the tires can do separate things. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4845.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4847.82s)]
*  Up with this side. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4848.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4849.82s)]
*  Oh, she's serious. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4850.82s)]
*  She's... [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4851.82s)]
*  Don't mess with my sister. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4852.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4853.82s)]
*  Is your sister out there off-roading? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4854.82s)]
*  What is she doing with that crazy truck? [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4855.82s)]
*  She just likes being badass when the time comes. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4857.62s)]
*  I like the way she thinks. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4861.22s)]
*  But she doesn't hunt. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4862.22s)]
*  So, it's missing half the equation there. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4865.22s)]
*  So on the subject of deer, in the chapter on gender and identity. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4867.38s)]
*  So I go there. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4873.86s)]
*  Gender and identity. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4874.86s)]
*  Because it's a very hot topic. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4875.86s)]
*  And I just apply some rational thinking to it. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4876.86s)]
*  Do you know about Santa's reindeer? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4880.1s)]
*  Do you know about them? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4882.02s)]
*  Sure. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4883.02s)]
*  I know very much about them. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4884.02s)]
*  Oh, you do? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4885.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4886.02s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4887.02s)]
*  So do you know that... [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4888.02s)]
*  The caribou. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4889.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4890.02s)]
*  Yeah, caribou, correct. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4891.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4892.02s)]
*  And well, you can domesticate the caribou. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4893.02s)]
*  When you do, then both the boys and the girls have antlers. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4894.22s)]
*  Okay? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4900.820000000001s)]
*  Well, that's just the fact of all caribou. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4901.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, all caribou. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4903.820000000001s)]
*  So, excuse me. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4904.820000000001s)]
*  But sorry, the domesticated ones are called reindeer. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4905.820000000001s)]
*  But they're derived from the caribou. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4907.22s)]
*  Correct. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4908.9800000000005s)]
*  So now watch what happens. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4909.9800000000005s)]
*  So, as you may know, the male deer lose their antlers in late October, early November. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4910.9800000000005s)]
*  Unless you castrated them. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4923.1s)]
*  Unless you castrated them. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4924.1s)]
*  Unless you castrated them, they'll keep their antlers. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4925.1s)]
*  But otherwise, they drop their antlers before winter begins. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4926.1s)]
*  Generally not. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4933.1s)]
*  No. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4934.1s)]
*  Well, it depends on the animal. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4935.1s)]
*  But a lot of them keep it until almost spring. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4936.740000000001s)]
*  And then they drop and they grow back very quickly. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4939.14s)]
*  That's nothing of what I've read or learned of this animal. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4941.54s)]
*  For deer? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4945.9800000000005s)]
*  Or just caribou? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4946.9800000000005s)]
*  No, caribou specifically. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4947.9800000000005s)]
*  The ones that became Santa's reindeer. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4948.9800000000005s)]
*  We're not talking about the deer in central Texas. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4951.34s)]
*  No. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4954.34s)]
*  They drop them in the winter. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4955.34s)]
*  They drop them November. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4956.34s)]
*  The female don't. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4959.34s)]
*  The female don't. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4961.179999999999s)]
*  So all that means is all eight of Santa's reindeer are female. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4962.179999999999s)]
*  Which means Rudolph has been misgendered. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4970.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4973.5s)]
*  Well, do you know where the myth of Santa's reindeer flying comes from? [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4974.5s)]
*  I think it's from mushrooms, isn't it? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4978.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4981.46s)]
*  The Ammonita muscaria mushroom, which looks like Santa Claus. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4982.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4983.46s)]
*  That's it. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4984.46s)]
*  With the red and white dots. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4985.46s)]
*  And they love those things. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4986.46s)]
*  They love the Ammonita muscaria mushroom to the point where when people are doing mushroom [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4987.46s)]
*  ceremonies and they go outside to urinate. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4991.98s)]
*  Oh, they drink the paint. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4994.1s)]
*  Caribou will knock you over to get to your urine. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4995.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4998.26s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=4999.26s)]
*  If you have domesticated caribou, they will knock you over to get to the urine because [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5000.26s)]
*  they smell the Ammonita muscaria and whatever the... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5003.66s)]
*  It's not psilocybin. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5007.46s)]
*  It has to be such a major... [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5009.34s)]
*  I'm trying to imagine how high I want to get to drink someone else's pee. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5010.34s)]
*  Well, caribou are not that wise, nor are they educated, nor do they even understand the [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5016.06s)]
*  concept of urine. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5022.06s)]
*  Whatever the psychoactive compound, well, their sense of smell is preposterously intense. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5024.14s)]
*  We can't even imagine what a deer can smell. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5031.86s)]
*  They can smell you hundreds of yards away. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5034.14s)]
*  I've seen deer go like this a hundred yards away and then they bolt because they smell [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5036.62s)]
*  you. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5041.62s)]
*  They catch your wind. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5042.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're amazing. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5043.62s)]
*  Here's a mystery that I've always had to this day because dogs have very acute sense of [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5044.62s)]
*  smell as well. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5049.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5050.22s)]
*  That's how you say that. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5051.22s)]
*  If you just say, dogs smell good, you don't know what that means. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5052.22s)]
*  Do they smell better than we do? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5055.74s)]
*  It's an ambiguous sentence. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5059.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5060.1s)]
*  So, they have an acute sense of smell. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5061.1s)]
*  If they smell so acutely, why do they get within a half inch of each other's butt? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5063.259999999999s)]
*  Because they want to smell each other. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5070.62s)]
*  You can smell that a hundred yards away. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5072.42s)]
*  Yeah, but they want to smell everything. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5074.259999999999s)]
*  They want to smell the hormones. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5075.5s)]
*  They want to smell even more. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5076.5s)]
*  They're intensely attracted. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5077.5s)]
*  So, it's so good. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5079.5s)]
*  Let me get up on it. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5081.98s)]
*  Yeah, they want to know if you're feeling aggressive, if you're in the heat. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5082.98s)]
*  They want to know all those things. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5088.86s)]
*  Fascinating animals. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5091.82s)]
*  I never had that urge to do that with other humans. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5092.82s)]
*  You know, a bear could smell somewhere in the neighborhood of nine times greater than [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5093.82s)]
*  a bloodhound. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5097.259999999999s)]
*  So, we should domesticate bears and track down. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5098.259999999999s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5100.82s)]
*  By the way, have you seen a bear? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5101.82s)]
*  You got to be able to find this. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5107.82s)]
*  I saw it on social media. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5109.98s)]
*  There's a bear walking down a highway, and there's a tipped over traffic cone, and it [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5110.98s)]
*  looks at it, and then it writes it back up and keeps walking by it. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5115.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5119.299999999999s)]
*  And I say to myself, because I have a chapter in here called Body and Mind. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5120.9800000000005s)]
*  There it is. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5124.58s)]
*  Check this out. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5125.58s)]
*  Just watch. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5126.58s)]
*  It's a black bear. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5127.58s)]
*  He's like, this looks wrong. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5128.58s)]
*  Clearly. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5129.58s)]
*  Yeah, it looks wrong. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5130.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5131.58s)]
*  By the way, you found this video really fast. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5132.58s)]
*  Thank you for this. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5133.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's a grizzly bear. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5134.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, he's got the lump on the neck? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5137.22s)]
*  Yeah, the way he looks. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5139.74s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5143.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's grizzly. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5144.58s)]
*  He just keeps going. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5145.58s)]
*  That's a total grizzly bear. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5146.58s)]
*  And he keeps going. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5147.58s)]
*  He didn't even look back. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5148.58s)]
*  What do you think's going on with that? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5149.74s)]
*  I don't want to say this evidence of intelligence so much as it's evidence of more going on [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5151.98s)]
*  inside the animal's head than any of us would have previously ever credited. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5158.74s)]
*  And another example, and I get this example in Body and Mind again, there's a magpie bird [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5164.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a bottle of water in some playground area, park area, and it goes up to the bottle [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5173.54s)]
*  of water and it dips its beak in to drink from it. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5180.7s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5182.9s)]
*  See it is? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5183.9s)]
*  Okay, it goes in and drinks from it. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5184.9s)]
*  Watch, it's going to drink. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5185.9s)]
*  But the problem is there's a limit to how far its beak can reach inside of it. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5187.72s)]
*  And so it gets a stone that fits inside the bottle, which raises the water level so that [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5194.24s)]
*  its beak can continue to drink from it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5201.92s)]
*  This is some Archimedean crazy stuff going on. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5205.4800000000005s)]
*  The magpie, by those in the know, is ranked among the smartest of birds. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5210.400000000001s)]
*  And this is doing something I think humans wouldn't even think to do. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5216.52s)]
*  Probably many humans. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5220.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5221.88s)]
*  And so do you remember, how did they teach you where humans were in the tree of life [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5222.88s)]
*  when you were in school? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5228.08s)]
*  Like, we were the smartest or the biggest brain. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5229.08s)]
*  How did they describe it to you? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5231.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're the top of the food chain. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5232.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5234.36s)]
*  And what did they say about our brains? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5235.36s)]
*  Just tell me in your... [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5236.96s)]
*  Well, it's the size of our brains that makes us so superior. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5237.96s)]
*  But then you look at a magpie... [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5240.48s)]
*  Yeah, but dolphins' brains are bigger. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5242.12s)]
*  Yeah, 40% larger. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5243.599999999999s)]
*  So then therefore what is... [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5245.4s)]
*  Whale brains are bigger. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5249.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5250.88s)]
*  So then how did they... [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5251.88s)]
*  If there are other animals with bigger brains and we want to stay at the top, what did they [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5253.28s)]
*  say about those other animals? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5256.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5257.44s)]
*  What did they say? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5258.44s)]
*  No, I'm saying. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5259.44s)]
*  Okay, so you know what they did? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5260.599999999999s)]
*  They say they're inferior? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5261.599999999999s)]
*  So what they did was they said, oh, no, we don't have the biggest brain. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5262.599999999999s)]
*  But brain to body weight ratio, then we're the highest. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5265.879999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5270.96s)]
*  Is that accurate with dolphins? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5271.96s)]
*  Yes, because they're bigger, much bigger creatures than we are. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5273.44s)]
*  And when you divide the weight of the brain by the weight of the body, we win. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5279.12s)]
*  We beat out whales, we beat out dolphins, we beat out elephants. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5283.759999999999s)]
*  And then there are those who are fans of those say, well, you want to do it lean weight because [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5289.16s)]
*  those... [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5293.16s)]
*  The dolphins in the whales have a lot of blubber and that's not... [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5294.16s)]
*  The brain is not having to control the blubber. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5296.76s)]
*  So cut away the blubber. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5298.96s)]
*  That boosts them, but they're still not as high as us. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5300.4400000000005s)]
*  So we walk away saying, we're at the top. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5302.68s)]
*  However, what they did not say, which I had to... [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5305.64s)]
*  40 years later, I learned this, that we do not have the highest brain to body weight [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5311.16s)]
*  ratio among animals, only among mammals. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5318.68s)]
*  The magpie has a higher brain to body weight ratio than humans do, as do all other mid-sized [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5322.96s)]
*  birds, like crows, owls, eagles, these folks, okay? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5330.5599999999995s)]
*  All have a higher brain to body weight ratio than humans do. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5338.5599999999995s)]
*  So that rule that put us at the top was specifically for mammals. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5341.44s)]
*  And I'm angry that I didn't think to hear how specific that was when I was taught that [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5347.639999999999s)]
*  in eighth grade. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5354.2s)]
*  Okay? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5355.599999999999s)]
*  Isn't our understanding of crows using tools very recent, like within the last hundred [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5356.599999999999s)]
*  years? [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5361.679999999999s)]
*  All I can tell you is any animal that we have ever got to study in more detail than we previously [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5362.679999999999s)]
*  did has shown to be more intelligent than we ever gave it credit for being. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5368.4s)]
*  And you know who has the biggest brain to body weight ratio of any creature on earth? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5372.84s)]
*  Who? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5377.96s)]
*  Some species of ants. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5379.48s)]
*  Really? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5380.96s)]
*  15% of their body weight is their brain. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5381.96s)]
*  And it's kind of obvious, some of them, like the whole front section is their head. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5383.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5387.48s)]
*  It's kind of, in retrospect, it's kind of obvious. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5388.48s)]
*  And ants are very busy doing some complicated things that we don't know what they're doing. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5390.92s)]
*  Especially leaf cutter ants. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5395.0s)]
*  They're busy carpenter ants, leaf cutting ants, and cross over into termite land. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5396.56s)]
*  I don't know how big their brains are, but they're busy building stuff. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5403.200000000001s)]
*  And they work in communication with each other somehow. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5406.320000000001s)]
*  And they communicate. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5408.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5409.200000000001s)]
*  One of my favorite cartoons was two dolphins swimming together. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5410.200000000001s)]
*  And there's a human up, you know, it's like one of these water parks, right? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5413.88s)]
*  And one dolphin says to the other, they, speaking of the humans that are up on dry land, they [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5418.160000000001s)]
*  face each other and make noises, but it's not clear they're actually communicating. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5423.6s)]
*  So I'm just saying, we have a close up of an ant. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5429.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's just recently released this image, I think. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5436.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5438.88s)]
*  So what a horrific demon that would be. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5439.88s)]
*  Insects with so much detail on their bodies. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5443.6s)]
*  And to say, well, we're at the top. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5446.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5448.4800000000005s)]
*  I got one for you. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5449.4800000000005s)]
*  How much of the top are you? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5450.64s)]
*  Do you realize one slice of your lower intestine, your colon, one centimeter slice lives and [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5451.68s)]
*  works more microbes than the total number of humans who ever lived. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5463.56s)]
*  So ask yourself, what are you to those microbes? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5474.12s)]
*  Are you Joe Rogan? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5482.08s)]
*  No, you are an anaerobic vessel of fecal matter in which they thrive. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5483.08s)]
*  And without them, you don't exist. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5489.92s)]
*  Well, you don't digest your food. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5491.48s)]
*  First of all, second, you want to keep them happy, because if they're not happy, then [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5493.16s)]
*  they're in charge. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5499.08s)]
*  They send you to the nearest toilet as fast as can be. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5500.799999999999s)]
*  So part of a cosmic perspective on this world is looking at things in a way that decentralizes [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5506.0s)]
*  who and what you are relative to everything else. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5512.84s)]
*  And you get a much more honest account of how things work, how they're put together. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5515.280000000001s)]
*  That's very hard for people to really grasp. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5521.68s)]
*  You're actually an ecosystem. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5524.12s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5525.88s)]
*  And what is the number? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5527.360000000001s)]
*  Some percent of your total body weight is the weight of other living things, especially [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5529.320000000001s)]
*  what's alive and thriving in your gut. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5533.76s)]
*  You just carry them along. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5535.92s)]
*  That's the case with all organisms, though. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5537.64s)]
*  We like to think of organisms as being individuals, but they're actually hosts. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5539.08s)]
*  I don't think amoebas have. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5543.4400000000005s)]
*  Not when you get down to single cells. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5546.4800000000005s)]
*  But others, yeah. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5548.72s)]
*  A lot of symbiotic relationships going on. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5549.88s)]
*  And so you can have a cosmic perspective that's not just the cosmos. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5552.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5556.4400000000005s)]
*  Cosmic perspective just here life on Earth. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5556.96s)]
*  And they talked about the overview effect where the astronauts, you probably had a few [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5560.76s)]
*  astronauts here as your guest. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5566.92s)]
*  Looking down. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5569.88s)]
*  Yeah, you look down. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5570.88s)]
*  I prefer the view from the moon. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5571.96s)]
*  I'll take it from orbit. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5573.84s)]
*  Are you going to do any of those? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5575.04s)]
*  If they let you up on the Jeff Bezos spaceship? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5576.72s)]
*  They send people up there all the time now, right? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5579.88s)]
*  So it's fairly regular. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5581.88s)]
*  I'm an astrophysicist. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5583.12s)]
*  You're not interested? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5585.0s)]
*  No, let me, let me, hear me out. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5586.0s)]
*  So take Earth and shrink it down to like a schoolroom globe. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5587.72s)]
*  So now we can think of distances relative to that. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5592.56s)]
*  And ask how high up did Bezos and Branson go? [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5595.84s)]
*  Okay, so here's the schoolroom. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5598.92s)]
*  How far away would you say? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5600.56s)]
*  Quarter inch. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5602.6s)]
*  You say quarter inch? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5603.6s)]
*  Okay, they went the thickness of two dimes. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5604.6s)]
*  And a boy who jumped out of a balloon some years ago. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5609.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5612.400000000001s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5613.400000000001s)]
*  Felix Bumgardner? [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5615.12s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5616.12s)]
*  So they went the thickness of one dime. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5617.5199999999995s)]
*  So this idea that they go, oh, I see the curvature of the Earth. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5619.32s)]
*  No, you don't. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5622.0s)]
*  You don't. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5623.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5624.0s)]
*  Did Jeff Bezos doesn't see the curvature of the Earth? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5625.0s)]
*  You will see the edge of the Earth. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5627.84s)]
*  But ask how far away is your horizon when you're only that high up. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5630.96s)]
*  You can just look at that. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5635.72s)]
*  Go to the schoolroom globe. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5638.68s)]
*  Go two dime thicknesses up and then draw a line to ask how much of Earth do you see? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5640.28s)]
*  You will see a circle, but that's a circle cookie cut out of the larger sphere. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5649.04s)]
*  So it's a perspective issue. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5653.32s)]
*  It's a perspective issue. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5655.36s)]
*  And by the way, the images when they showed Felix Bumgardner, where he's prepared to jump, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5657.24s)]
*  you see this curved Earth. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5663.54s)]
*  That's a fisheye lens, dude. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5665.92s)]
*  Okay? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5668.24s)]
*  So a fisheye lens is take horizontal lines and bend them convex when you're above the [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5669.24s)]
*  midplane of the photo. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5675.84s)]
*  In order to gather in more of the image. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5677.84s)]
*  Correct. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5679.96s)]
*  That's the only way you can distort it to fit it onto a flat plane because it's looking [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5680.96s)]
*  at a full sort of 360, well, 180, all right, and it's trying to get it in. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5684.08s)]
*  But what happens if you take that horizontal line, the horizon, and put it below the midplane [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5689.16s)]
*  of the camera? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5694.08s)]
*  It then bends the other way. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5695.08s)]
*  Bends the other way. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5697.92s)]
*  In fact, I have a tweet that did this. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5699.0s)]
*  Look for Felix and throw some keywords in there with my Twitter handle. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5703.4s)]
*  And I have an example of the photos. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5708.12s)]
*  So no, he didn't see the curvature of the Earth, but you think he did and he's high [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5710.36s)]
*  up and what do we need NASA for? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5713.56s)]
*  Right? [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5715.68s)]
*  He's one dime thickness. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5716.68s)]
*  Elon Musk authentically goes into orbit because they didn't go into orbit. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5720.4s)]
*  They went up and fell back to Earth. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5723.64s)]
*  He authentically goes into orbit. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5725.24s)]
*  So he is a centimeter, not even, let me see, yeah, a little less than a centimeter above [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5727.84s)]
*  Earth's surface. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5737.56s)]
*  The folks who really saw Earth were the folks that went to the moon. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5738.8s)]
*  We went to the moon nine times, three astronauts a pop, 27 astronauts have seen Earth from [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5745.32s)]
*  the moon. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5750.12s)]
*  And that'll change you. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5752.24s)]
*  That Apollo 14 astronaut, Edgar Mitchell, I have a quote from him that opens this book. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5755.8s)]
*  And that's all you have to read because the whole book issues forth from that quote. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5766.76s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5771.88s)]
*  Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5775.76s)]
*  You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5778.84s)]
*  with the state of the world and a compulsion to do something about it. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5786.56s)]
*  From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5791.88s)]
*  You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter million [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5795.92s)]
*  miles out and say, look at that, you son of a bitch. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5800.04s)]
*  Edgar Mitchell also believes some wacky stuff. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5805.04s)]
*  Did you know that? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5807.08s)]
*  Yeah, I've spoken with him about it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5808.32s)]
*  And he was one of the, was he co-founder of the Noetic Institute? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5810.4s)]
*  He was a big fan of the possibility that there was a deeper level of consciousness. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5817.08s)]
*  And I don't think it involved drugs, but just that there was a deeper level of consciousness [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5824.36s)]
*  that the brain might be capable of if subjected to the proper influences. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5831.4s)]
*  And he told me how he came across this. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5838.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, I'll tell you. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5840.96s)]
*  They're on their way back from the moon and they're in the capsule and the capsule rotates. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5841.96s)]
*  It helps to stabilize it among other reasons for that happening. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5848.320000000001s)]
*  And he happened to be positioned in the capsule for three days where the windows to the capsule [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5853.24s)]
*  were aligned with the plane of the solar system, which means every time the capsule rotated, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5861.72s)]
*  what came in and out of view was the sun, the moon, earth, and all the planets. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5872.320000000001s)]
*  And so he's there for three days watching this drift by. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5880.4800000000005s)]
*  And he felt like he had descended or ascended into a trance state that was beyond what he [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5886.64s)]
*  had ever experienced here on earth by normal things you encounter just being a human on [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5896.280000000001s)]
*  earth. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5903.400000000001s)]
*  And that led him to wonder whether this was an achievable state by some other means, by [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5904.9400000000005s)]
*  some other forces that you could emulate here on earth. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5912.84s)]
*  And because he experienced that and I didn't, who am I to say? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5917.72s)]
*  I'm not going to judge that. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5923.12s)]
*  He believed in psychokinetics. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5925.04s)]
*  He believed people can do things with their mind. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5926.96s)]
*  He had a lot of very strange things that he was interested in. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5929.92s)]
*  I think the cleanest way to say that is he believed there was much more capacity of our [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5933.12s)]
*  mind than we had previously tapped. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5939.16s)]
*  And that opens up the gates to all these other things. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5942.0s)]
*  But I was just sharing with you the cycle, the experiential origins of why he thought [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5944.8s)]
*  that way. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5953.4800000000005s)]
*  But the point is that that can change you. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5955.08s)]
*  And in the chapter Earth and Moon, I talk about cosmic perspectives. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5959.16s)]
*  As you ascend, the earth does not look like the schoolroom globe. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5964.5s)]
*  Color-coded countries? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5970.0s)]
*  Only as an adult did I look back on that and I say, you trained me from elementary school [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5971.24s)]
*  to know who my enemies are and who my friends are by color-coding contiguous land masses [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5980.8s)]
*  on a globe to teach me about the planet Earth. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5987.4800000000005s)]
*  But they weren't trying to do that. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5991.2s)]
*  They were trying to explain geography. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5992.4s)]
*  It's a consequence of it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5993.4s)]
*  I knew who the evil, godless Soviet Union was. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5994.96s)]
*  Their country was painted red. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=5999.759999999999s)]
*  Not ours. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6003.08s)]
*  I knew this even if it was not on purpose. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6004.5599999999995s)]
*  It had a subliminal effect. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6007.679999999999s)]
*  And when you go into space, the country borders go away, except for two places. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6010.28s)]
*  There are two places. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6015.36s)]
*  You can still see two borders from space. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6017.719999999999s)]
*  One of them in the daytime, you can see the border of Israel with surrounding deserts [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6021.5199999999995s)]
*  because Israel irrigates. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6027.76s)]
*  And so it's green and the surrounding areas are brown. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6031.76s)]
*  You can see that from space. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6035.240000000001s)]
*  Another border, which you can see from space at night, is of course, North and South Korea [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6036.88s)]
*  right there. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6042.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6043.580000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6044.580000000001s)]
*  And that's punched up. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6045.580000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you were in the dead of night, you don't know the difference between the [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6046.580000000001s)]
*  and the land as your sight line crosses North and South Korea. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6050.4s)]
*  And so if you look at the GDP per capita differences between Israel and surrounding nations and [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6057.88s)]
*  South Korea and North Korea, it's factors of eight, nine, 10, 12. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6067.76s)]
*  And so space can reveal economic inequities in at least those two places, which is itself [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6073.959999999999s)]
*  kind of a stunning fact. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6083.959999999999s)]
*  So I want to tell Elon, you know, neighbors with him, right? [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6087.919999999999s)]
*  Get him back here and say, Elon, build a bus, a space bus. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6091.48s)]
*  We have an air bus. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6095.799999999999s)]
*  Why not a space bus? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6096.799999999999s)]
*  A space bus where you put all the warring leaders and have them send them to the moon, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6098.639999999999s)]
*  and have them look back on Earth. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6103.92s)]
*  So, you know, we're fighting over that border. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6104.92s)]
*  We are. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6105.92s)]
*  Once they came back down, I think they'd just go right back to work. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6106.92s)]
*  You think so? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6109.36s)]
*  I just went to the Keck Observatory on Wednesday. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6110.48s)]
*  Nice. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6113.0s)]
*  It was Hawaii. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6115.0s)]
*  Big island. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6116.0s)]
*  Very nice. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6117.0s)]
*  Did you go to the base camp or already at the top? [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6118.0s)]
*  The base camp. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6119.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6120.0s)]
*  I went specifically there because I had an experience there about, I was six, 17 years [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6121.0s)]
*  ago. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6127.32s)]
*  I got there and I caught it on a perfect night where the moon wasn't out and it was phenomenal. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6128.32s)]
*  And the view is so astounding. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6134.92s)]
*  There's so many stars. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6137.44s)]
*  You see the Milky Way in such clear detail that you have a totally different perspective [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6138.44s)]
*  of the cosmos. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6142.799999999999s)]
*  It's sad. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6143.799999999999s)]
*  And you feel like you're flying through space with a windshield over your head, like you're [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6144.799999999999s)]
*  in a spaceship. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6150.599999999999s)]
*  You know, there's some other, my entire PhD thesis involved mountain going. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6151.719999999999s)]
*  It's a lost ritual because now we'd have what's called service observing. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6157.52s)]
*  You just write in what things you want to observe them, what nights, for how many hours, [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6163.120000000001s)]
*  and then they send you back the data. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6167.6s)]
*  There used to be a pilgrimage to the top of a mountain and you'd live nocturnally and [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6168.6s)]
*  you'd go to them and be up all night with the telescope and the universe. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6172.64s)]
*  There's a certain almost spiritual connectivity that brings upon you when it's just you alone. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6176.400000000001s)]
*  In their moments, the mountains are high up enough so that if clouds roll in, you're above [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6186.98s)]
*  the clouds. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6192.54s)]
*  We were above the clouds. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6193.54s)]
*  You're above the clouds. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6194.54s)]
*  This is what makes it especially spooky, magical, mystical, Mount Olympus-like. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6195.54s)]
*  Because you're on the top. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6201.419999999999s)]
*  There's no other land. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6202.78s)]
*  It's just clouds. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6204.179999999999s)]
*  So it's you, the tops of clouds, and the universe communing with the cosmos. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6205.7s)]
*  The view of it is so astounding. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6214.18s)]
*  Many people who go to Australia say, oh, you've got to see the southern skies. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6217.9s)]
*  What they don't know when they say that is any clear sky anywhere in the world will get [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6223.46s)]
*  you that. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6229.72s)]
*  In the southern hemisphere, only 15% of humans live there. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6231.82s)]
*  So there's essentially no light pollution anywhere there. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6237.74s)]
*  85% of all humans in the north, you're hard pressed to find a completely dark sky in the [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6241.58s)]
*  north, leaving you to think that there's something magically beautiful and different about the [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6246.9s)]
*  southern sky. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6251.3s)]
*  You're observing the northern sky. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6252.3s)]
*  Hawaii's like 15 degrees north, so it's a lot of the southern sky as well. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6254.46s)]
*  Point is, you have the best observing site in the world, which is why they wanted to [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6259.22s)]
*  telescope there, and there's some conflict with the indigenous groups regarding that [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6265.46s)]
*  and whether the mountain is sacred and in what ways it's sacred and the like. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6272.38s)]
*  And so that's still going on, last I checked. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6276.54s)]
*  But I'm not surprised and I'm delighted that you had that experience. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6278.78s)]
*  And now you know how I feel when I look up. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6282.74s)]
*  I was baptized in, emotionally, psychologically baptized with the night sky in New York City's [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6285.22s)]
*  Hayden Planetarium. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6292.22s)]
*  Because as a city kid, I grew up in the Bronx. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6294.1s)]
*  We don't have a relationship with the night sky. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6296.54s)]
*  We might see the moon and an occasional planet, the setting sun, that's it. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6299.58s)]
*  Couple of dots for stars. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6304.58s)]
*  You see the tall buildings. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6306.62s)]
*  Back then there was air pollution, light pollution. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6308.62s)]
*  So my first night sky was the Hayden Planetarium. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6312.66s)]
*  To this day, I was nine years old. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6315.5s)]
*  When I go to mountaintops, just as you experience, and I look up, I said to myself, this is so [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6319.179999999999s)]
*  beautiful. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6324.42s)]
*  It reminds me of the Hayden Planetarium. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6325.42s)]
*  I know that's messed up, but that's how I feel. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6327.42s)]
*  And you got a sky here with meteors. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6332.099999999999s)]
*  I'm loving it, man. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6334.62s)]
*  I'm loving it. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6336.62s)]
*  The view that I saw on Wednesday was not as good as the view that I saw whatever it was, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6338.62s)]
*  16, 17 years ago. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6343.42s)]
*  Wait, wait, who laid out these stars? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6344.42s)]
*  Oh, it's just there's LED panels. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6345.42s)]
*  Call me. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6348.14s)]
*  No, they're not accurate. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6349.14s)]
*  They're just dots. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6350.14s)]
*  Dude. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6351.14s)]
*  All right. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6352.14s)]
*  At least you have stars. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6353.14s)]
*  In my old pool in California, I had the star system of where, like, you know, I was born [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6354.74s)]
*  in August. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6362.62s)]
*  So it's the constellation Leo. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6363.82s)]
*  When you were born? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6365.54s)]
*  Yeah, when I was born. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6366.54s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6367.54s)]
*  Embedded into the ground of the pool. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6368.54s)]
*  All right. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6370.9s)]
*  There you go. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6371.9s)]
*  There you go. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6372.9s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6373.9s)]
*  You know, if they're asking me to verify, I'm like, wow, it looks like stars. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6375.379999999999s)]
*  But that view of the Keck Observatory, just even from the base station, it's so stunning [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6380.98s)]
*  that it does reset your understanding of where we are. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6387.259999999999s)]
*  And it makes you angry that we have so much light pollution that people are denied that. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6390.82s)]
*  Because I think it changes the way people view our relationship with the cosmos. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6395.66s)]
*  In fact, it goes even deeper than that. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6399.54s)]
*  Let me quickly comment that there is an entire indigenous community in the world that is [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6402.1s)]
*  very concerned about the loss of very dark night skies. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6413.34s)]
*  Because so much of the culture relates to that night sky as part of what it values and [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6417.620000000001s)]
*  what it passes down from one generation to the next. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6422.900000000001s)]
*  And it goes beyond just the light pollution. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6425.900000000001s)]
*  Because now, folks like your boy Elon is launching, and I don't like the fact that they use the [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6428.3s)]
*  word constellation to refer to satellites, because that's my word. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6437.78s)]
*  That's my people's word. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6441.42s)]
*  Constellations. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6442.54s)]
*  They're actual stars. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6443.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6444.54s)]
*  Not moving hardware. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6445.54s)]
*  We've talked to them. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6446.54s)]
*  We've got people talking to people. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6447.54s)]
*  I could connect you. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6449.14s)]
*  No, no. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6450.62s)]
*  We're friends. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6451.62s)]
*  Just hey, bro. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6452.62s)]
*  We're using the wrong words. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6453.62s)]
*  I feel completely at home speaking to him. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6457.14s)]
*  He's on the spectrum a bit. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6459.02s)]
*  I'd say one out of six of my colleagues is probably on the autism spectrum. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6460.3s)]
*  In retrospect, now that I look at it, once you learn what the spectrum is, there used [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6465.860000000001s)]
*  to be Asperger's and then they folded that in. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6470.3s)]
*  There are colleagues who just would not relate to another person or a camera, but they were [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6472.54s)]
*  graded in their lab and in the things. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6479.38s)]
*  And so you say you're just not socialized. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6481.5s)]
*  No, there's something else going on in there. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6483.54s)]
*  Can I ask you a question about that? [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6485.02s)]
*  Oh, sure. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6486.62s)]
*  Do you think that that is an evolutionary advantage that in some way people are developing [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6487.62s)]
*  in this manner so that they can concentrate on things like technology, like astrophysics, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6493.94s)]
*  like these very specific things that require immense amounts of concentration and extreme [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6502.74s)]
*  focus? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6509.66s)]
*  Do you think there's possibly that human beings are developing in that way specifically to [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6510.66s)]
*  accentuate our ability to innovate? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6515.86s)]
*  So it would be very hard to draw that conclusion as some kind of modern force of evolution, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6519.299999999999s)]
*  because for that to be the case, what would have to happen is those who had this sort [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6525.7s)]
*  of autistic level of focus, so high functioning autism, they would have to be making more [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6531.5s)]
*  babies than other people. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6537.5s)]
*  Well, Elon is. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6539.299999999999s)]
*  He's out there doing his part. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6540.299999999999s)]
*  So they'd have to be making more babies relative to everyone else to affect the evolutionary [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6544.78s)]
*  path of modern civilization. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6551.66s)]
*  And it's not clear that that's what's actually happening. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6553.139999999999s)]
*  So we have to ask, did that have any value historically in the history of the evolution [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6556.32s)]
*  of our species? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6561.219999999999s)]
*  So in the chapter Body and Mind, I go over the variations that exist within our species. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6562.42s)]
*  Huge variations in height and weight and in speed and in all kinds of things. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6572.66s)]
*  And you can ask, well, then what is normal? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6582.94s)]
*  The day that we control the genome, is it going to be some place somewhere where there's [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6588.66s)]
*  a normal human and you're going to take your genome that you're about to control in your [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6593.86s)]
*  and say, let me adjust it so that it matches this so that all your senses are working as [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6599.66s)]
*  they're supposed to and all the proportion. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6604.94s)]
*  Is that the future? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6608.18s)]
*  We should ask that. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6609.22s)]
*  Because if that's what you're going to do, you're going to homogenize the species. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6610.82s)]
*  Do you realize I have a run here of content? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6617.9s)]
*  I have a run of descriptions of what people have accomplished. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6625.86s)]
*  So for example, there's a guy growing up, he wanted to play basketball. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6631.38s)]
*  And he wanted to be a professional basketball player. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6638.179999999999s)]
*  So he worked really hard at it. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6641.259999999999s)]
*  And he just wasn't tall enough. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6645.299999999999s)]
*  So he said you should give it up, take on it. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6647.0199999999995s)]
*  But he stayed with it. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6649.099999999999s)]
*  Stayed with it. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6651.54s)]
*  They said no, best was for tall people. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6652.54s)]
*  They're not tall. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6655.82s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6656.82s)]
*  He now plays for the Harlem Globetrotters. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6657.82s)]
*  His name is Hotshot. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6663.900000000001s)]
*  What's his last name? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6664.900000000001s)]
*  Muggsy Bogues is a great example. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6667.900000000001s)]
*  This guy is four feet five. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6670.26s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6672.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6673.58s)]
*  He's a genetic dwarf. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6674.58s)]
*  People told him he can't play basketball. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6676.900000000001s)]
*  And now he's one of the most popular basketball players. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6678.38s)]
*  There he goes. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6683.38s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6684.42s)]
*  Swanson, Hotshot Swanson. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6685.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6686.42s)]
*  Well, there kind of seems like there's an advantage of being that small so you can move [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6687.42s)]
*  around that way. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6692.58s)]
*  All I'm making a different point. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6693.58s)]
*  Yes, the best part of the point. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6695.58s)]
*  The point is when you look at someone and they're not quote normal, and then you start [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6697.7s)]
*  listing what you think they should not do in life. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6703.9800000000005s)]
*  Constraining the options that maybe they have ambitions that are greater than anything you [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6709.66s)]
*  imagined. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6713.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6714.66s)]
*  And so there's a letter. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6716.26s)]
*  There's a letter beautifully written of someone took a voyage on a steamship in 1915. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6719.9s)]
*  And I reproduced the letter in here. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6728.3s)]
*  Beautifully written. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6731.58s)]
*  And this passenger was given a tour of their steamship. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6732.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6736.9s)]
*  By the captain. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6737.9s)]
*  And this letter, I can't find it in here, but it's beautifully. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6738.9s)]
*  I mean, is there time for me to read something? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6742.62s)]
*  Sure. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6744.62s)]
*  Can I do plenty of time? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6745.62s)]
*  I gotta read it. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6746.62s)]
*  We have all the time in the world. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6747.62s)]
*  Give me a second here and talk among yourselves. [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6748.62s)]
*  What? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6751.62s)]
*  What? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6752.62s)]
*  H and J. G. I got it. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6753.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6762.62s)]
*  There it goes. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6763.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6766.62s)]
*  Here's a letter. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6767.62s)]
*  Okay. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6770.62s)]
*  Again, this is in the body and mind chapter where we explore. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6772.099999999999s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6780.0599999999995s)]
*  I had the wrong year. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6781.0599999999995s)]
*  How about a letter written on April 10th, 1930 to Captain Von Beck of the US lines, [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6783.54s)]
*  SS President Roosevelt. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6790.34s)]
*  That's Teddy Roosevelt, of course. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6792.34s)]
*  The captain had given a tour of the bridge to a passenger who later that day waxed poetic [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6794.0599999999995s)]
*  about the experience. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6800.06s)]
*  Again, I stood with the captain on the bridge and he was quiet and composed in the presence [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6801.54s)]
*  of a million universes, a man with the power of a God. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6808.0s)]
*  In imagination, I saw the captain standing on the bridge, gazing into the wide canopied [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6813.5s)]
*  heavens and seeing the darkness sprinkled with stars, systems, and galaxies. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6819.22s)]
*  That passenger was Helen Keller, a 1904 graduate of Radcliffe College. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6828.78s)]
*  Okay. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6836.62s)]
*  My point is, and I have other, there's a whole run of pages of things and there's a whole [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6840.42s)]
*  description of hotshot here from the Harlem Go Tribe. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6846.66s)]
*  My point is the moment you homogenize, I quote, normalize who and what humans should be, you [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6849.94s)]
*  have cut off so much of what has enriched civilization simply because people were different. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6858.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6869.1s)]
*  Simply because. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6871.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6872.22s)]
*  And so if everybody's the same, what kind of world, I don't want to live in that world. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6873.22s)]
*  Give me a different world. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6878.3s)]
*  Do you worry that- [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6879.780000000001s)]
*  I got another one here. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6880.780000000001s)]
*  Please. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6881.780000000001s)]
*  One more, okay? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6882.780000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6884.780000000001s)]
*  You probably know this, but those who don't know the name, hold off on it, okay? [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6886.9s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6891.22s)]
*  Jim Abbott. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6892.22s)]
*  You know Jim Abbott is- [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6893.22s)]
*  Sure. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6894.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6895.22s)]
*  Some people won't, but here it goes. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6896.22s)]

*  boys. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6902.22s)]
*  Jim wanted to be a pitcher in the major leagues. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6903.22s)]
*  He succeeded and played for many teams, chalking up a mixed record of wins and losses, but [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6905.86s)]

*  I thought it was the Mets. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6921.9400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6922.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm not a big baseball fan. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6923.9400000000005s)]
*  He pitched a no-hitter. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6924.9400000000005s)]
*  That's when no batter gets a hit in the entire game. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6926.700000000001s)]
*  There have been about 320 no-hitters in major league history out of 220,000 games played. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6930.26s)]

*  Is he? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6951.34s)]
*  He pitched a fucking no-hitter for the New York Yankees. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6952.56s)]
*  What I'm saying is, obviously not everyone who has a disability will achieve this way. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6955.7s)]
*  Don't get me wrong here, but what I want to say is, look at what people would have told, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6962.98s)]
*  and I have six other examples here, one right after another, what people would have told [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6968.7s)]

*  the world the way animals do, she could advise farmers in ways they can handle in her cows [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6989.62s)]
*  that does not create stress in them. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6995.22s)]
*  She figures stuff out. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6997.46s)]
*  She has research papers. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6998.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=6999.66s)]
*  But you're going to say, oh, she's not the life of the party, get her out of here? [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7000.66s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7005.66s)]
*  Can I give you an example? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7006.66s)]
*  As human beings. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7007.66s)]
*  A personal example? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7008.66s)]
*  What the hell? [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7009.66s)]
*  I was angry writing that chapter. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7011.139999999999s)]
*  I was angry. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7012.94s)]
*  One more. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7013.94s)]
*  I got to go. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7014.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7015.94s)]

*  My jujitsu instructor, John Jacque Machado, was born on his left hand. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7019.26s)]
*  He only has a thumb. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7024.58s)]
*  He has a genetic defect where he has no fingers on his left hand. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7026.099999999999s)]
*  Call it a genetic feature. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7029.9s)]
*  A genetic feature. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7030.9s)]
*  See, you value judging. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7031.9s)]
*  It is a feature because he's a multiple time world champion. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7032.9s)]
*  There it is. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7035.82s)]
*  He's one of the best. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7036.98s)]

*  He's one of the best. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7059.98s)]
*  And he also developed a style that didn't rely on grips. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7061.0599999999995s)]
*  He developed a style that's over hooks and under hooks, which became modern no-gi jiu-jitsu, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7064.259999999999s)]
*  which is incorporated in mixed martial arts because in mixed martial arts they don't wear [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7071.339999999999s)]
*  the kimono. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7075.419999999999s)]

*  He was also a best-selling author describing the human brain as the most incredible thing [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7099.82s)]
*  in the universe. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7105.179999999999s)]
*  He led a remarkably varied life while suffering from a neurological affliction called prospo-pagnosia, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7106.919999999999s)]
*  more commonly known as face blindness. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7116.62s)]
*  This condition contributed to his severe shyness since he couldn't recognize faces, even if [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7119.46s)]
*  he recognized everything else about you. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7126.46s)]
*  At times, he would not even recognize his own face in the mirror. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7130.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7137.82s)]
*  And he's shy because if he's interested in a... [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7138.82s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7141.9800000000005s)]
*  If he has a love interest, he doesn't know the next time he sees that person whether [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7142.9800000000005s)]
*  That was who we had the conversation with. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7147.84s)]
*  Okay? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7149.72s)]
*  In 2012, after a lecture on hallucination at Cooper Union College in New York City, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7150.72s)]
*  I asked him, if you could go back in time, would you take a magic pill in your youth [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7156.56s)]
*  to cure your neurological disorder? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7162.96s)]
*  Without hesitation, he replied, no. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7166.64s)]
*  His entire professional interest in the human mind was inspired by the very disorders in [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7171.06s)]
*  his own brain. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7178.34s)]
*  He wouldn't have it any other way. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7180.02s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7183.780000000001s)]
*  Where they can't see faces, but they can read? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7185.38s)]
*  No, you can see faces. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7187.46s)]
*  They just don't recognize them. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7188.46s)]
*  It doesn't land in any place that you recognize. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7189.46s)]
*  Every face, even if you've seen it before, is like a brand new face. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7192.660000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7197.06s)]
*  He'd have to recognize your voice, your vocabulary, your accents, your body gestures, this sort [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7198.06s)]
*  of thing. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7206.22s)]
*  Wow. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7207.22s)]

*  Proxbo... [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7213.22s)]
*  Diagnosia? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7214.22s)]
*  Yeah, I... [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7215.22s)]
*  See if that's true. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7216.22s)]
*  I felt like he said he has some form of that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7219.22s)]
*  Is that what he told one girlfriend when he saw the next one? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7223.22s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7225.34s)]
*  How dare you? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7226.34s)]
*  Yeah, he does? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7227.62s)]
*  He has some variant on that. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7228.62s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7230.62s)]
*  People.com, it says that. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7231.62s)]
*  Yeah, he explained that. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7232.62s)]
*  He hasn't officially been diagnosed with it. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7233.62s)]
*  He has extremely, extreme difficulty recognizing people's faces. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7235.42s)]
*  Wow. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7239.06s)]
*  So, maybe there's a varying spectrum of that disorder. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7240.06s)]
*  Yeah, of course, as there would be in anything. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7241.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7243.34s)]

*  So, all of this you'd expect to happen on some kind of spectrum of severity, let's call [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7256.34s)]
*  it, or featureity. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7264.9400000000005s)]
*  And depending on where you are on that spectrum, you will have certain access to ways people [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7269.62s)]
*  have never thought before, ways people have never done things before. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7277.46s)]
*  Have you seen the video of the woman somewhere in East Asia who has no arms? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7282.3s)]
*  And she gets out of bed, folds up her, takes care of her child, puts on her makeup. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7289.02s)]
*  With her feet. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7293.14s)]
*  With her feet. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7294.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7295.14s)]
*  With her feet. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7296.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7297.14s)]
*  And so, yeah, she puts on her makeup and puts on her coat, puts on, there's a whole video [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7298.14s)]
*  about this. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7302.54s)]
*  And so, I don't know what else to tell you. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7304.54s)]
*  Oh, you must know this is my other guy here. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7309.66s)]
*  You must know him. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7313.099999999999s)]
*  If not, get him on, okay? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7314.099999999999s)]
*  Get the dude on your show. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7317.0599999999995s)]
*  Hang on. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7318.0599999999995s)]
*  This is a study show. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7319.0599999999995s)]
*  One in 50 people may have developed that face blindness. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7321.0599999999995s)]
*  It could be genetic, but this doesn't seem to be. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7325.099999999999s)]
*  Developmental. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7327.9s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7328.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's, it's... [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7329.9s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7330.9s)]
*  But, how is it that he always winds up with hot women? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7331.9s)]
*  Come on, Brad. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7335.58s)]
*  He said people don't believe him because he's like, they think it's self-absorbeness and [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7337.5s)]
*  stuff. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7340.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7341.38s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7342.38s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7343.38s)]
*  Here's another one. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7344.38s)]
*  You ready? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7345.38s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7346.38s)]
*  Matt Stutzman. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7347.38s)]
*  I recognize the name. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7349.7s)]
*  Is a championship archer. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7352.22s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7353.78s)]
*  That's exactly it. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7354.78s)]
*  Who can out-shoot most people who have ever wielded a bow and arrow. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7355.78s)]
*  He's actually coached by my friend John Dudley. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7359.54s)]
*  In competition. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7361.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7362.7s)]
*  By bow and arrow, in competition. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7363.7s)]
*  He's also a car enthusiast. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7367.42s)]
*  Oh, he was born without arms. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7368.9s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7371.26s)]
*  He shoots his arrows and fixes his cars using his uncommonly nimble legs, feet, and toes. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7372.26s)]
*  Is Matt Stutzman disabled? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7380.3s)]
*  All I'm here to say is, because you started this conversation asking me on the spectrum [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7381.7s)]
*  of autism, where at some point in that spectrum, you focus like no one can focus before. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7390.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7400.02s)]
*  Possibly to the exclusion of personal hygiene and other concerns related to your health. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7401.02s)]
*  Civilization has definitely benefited from those who have been able to focus in such [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7408.46s)]
*  a way. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7413.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7414.62s)]
*  Maybe our species and the advance of civilization itself has pivoted on the fact that in the [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7416.0199999999995s)]
*  variation of who, what, and what we are, some of us can focus and solve a problem like it [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7426.86s)]
*  was the most important thing we would ever do in our lives. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7435.22s)]
*  And end up doing so, thereby pivoting civilization into some future that would have not otherwise [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7438.3s)]
*  been realizable. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7448.06s)]
*  So yeah, I'm all there. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7450.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7453.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, the diversity of human beings and their interests and what they look like and [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7454.660000000001s)]
*  their sizes and the way they interact with the world is one of the reasons why we can [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7458.780000000001s)]
*  create such an amazing world. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7463.46s)]
*  But it also, and it goes beyond just this, what we call these disabled features, right, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7466.98s)]
*  people with disabilities, it goes to other things. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7472.339999999999s)]
*  For example, you must know that it was not until 1987 where the American Psychiatric [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7475.419999999999s)]
*  Association, with some names such as that, but the psychiatrists, removed homosexuality [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7483.219999999999s)]
*  as a mental disorder from their records, from their encyclopedia. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7490.099999999999s)]
*  1987, a disorder. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7496.58s)]
*  And so what does that even mean if, whatever the number is, 10, 20% of people or higher [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7499.58s)]
*  are on a gender spectrum as measured in the multiple dimensions that have revealed, have [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7508.0199999999995s)]
*  been revealed in recent years? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7514.58s)]
*  If you had control over the genome of your children 50 years ago, and if homosexuality [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7519.18s)]
*  has a genetic component, would you say, I don't want that? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7527.62s)]
*  That's abnormal because you're going to go through that list of what is normal. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7531.42s)]
*  And you're going to say, I don't want any abnormalities in my children. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7534.860000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7539.900000000001s)]
*  So there's an entire ethical frontier that is yet to be touched, yet to be resolved, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7541.62s)]
*  I should say. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7548.5s)]
*  Certainly there are people thinking about it. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7549.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7550.5s)]
*  Where, what kind of child are you going to create? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7551.5s)]
*  Well this is the question. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7555.94s)]
*  When you have, and this is what I wanted to get to, when you have things like CRISPR and [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7558.02s)]
*  you have what could be legitimate genetic engineering of fetuses and of embryos. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7562.54s)]
*  Legitimate, you mean authentic? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7572.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7573.9s)]
*  Yeah, legitimate implies it's sanctioned. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7574.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like they can do it. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7575.9s)]
*  I mean not sanctioned. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7577.9s)]
*  But the fact that that is an emerging technology and that like all technologies it will increase [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7579.26s)]
*  in its ability with innovation, with new versions. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7586.36s)]
*  Where do you think this goes? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7590.9s)]
*  Do you think it's inevitable that human beings engineer ourselves into these super creatures [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7592.0599999999995s)]
*  that are homogenous? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7597.34s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7598.66s)]
*  I think we, as has almost always been the case, the science is advancing faster than [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7600.099999999999s)]
*  our morality. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7609.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7610.5s)]
*  Or our sensibilities. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7611.5s)]
*  Our appreciations of humanity. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7614.5s)]
*  You know, and often the scientific advance has very important plus sides to it. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7617.66s)]
*  Here's what I want to see happen. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7622.86s)]
*  If we can control the genome, let's just start with what already exists in nature, all right? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7623.94s)]
*  We put ourselves at the top of the tree of life. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7629.18s)]
*  But if newts could draw the tree of life, they put themselves at the top. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7631.9800000000005s)]
*  Why? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7638.38s)]
*  They can regenerate their limbs. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7639.38s)]
*  And we can't. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7642.06s)]
*  They would value that very highly. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7644.320000000001s)]
*  So would we. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7646.06s)]
*  Let's get whatever that is in the newts, splice it into us, line up all the veterans who have, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7647.06s)]
*  you know, missing limbs, put them first. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7653.8s)]
*  If lobsters can do it and crabs can do it and newts can do it. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7658.62s)]
*  They are doing research on that, correct? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7663.78s)]
*  I have to, I haven't checked it. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7665.62s)]
*  I believe I have read. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7668.379999999999s)]
*  I would hope so. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7669.379999999999s)]
*  But we're doing research on growing organs. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7670.379999999999s)]
*  There's a huge need for that. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7674.54s)]
*  You don't have to wait for someone to die. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7676.9s)]
*  Particularly the day we have self-driving cars on the road dominating the population [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7679.58s)]
*  of cars, I see that happening within decades, by the way. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7687.06s)]
*  And I have good reason for thinking that. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7690.1s)]
*  But the day that happens, we lose, so no longer do 35,000 people a year die in peak physical [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7691.9400000000005s)]
*  health, which has been a source of so many organs, organ donors, right? [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7699.5s)]
*  You sign your card when you get your driver's license so that when you die in a car accident, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7704.860000000001s)]
*  we can harvest your organs. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7708.46s)]
*  You're young and all your organs work. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7710.14s)]
*  We don't harvest organs of 80-year-olds because they're 80 or 90, right? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7712.16s)]
*  So the day we lose the 35,000 deaths per year, I hope that happens at a time when we can [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7718.4s)]
*  start growing artificial organs. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7725.639999999999s)]
*  Have you done any playing around with auto-driving features on things like Teslas? [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7727.48s)]
*  I know it's there, but I'm not mentally ready to experiment. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7734.16s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7739.12s)]
*  Jamie and I have the latest beta of Tesla self-driving. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7740.68s)]
*  Have you messed with it at all, Jamie? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7745.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7747.32s)]
*  What's your take on it? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7750.24s)]
*  I had someone drive me around with it in the beta. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7751.599999999999s)]
*  Not comfortable yet is the best I would say. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7757.5599999999995s)]
*  You keep your hands on the wheel? [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7760.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7761.76s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7762.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7763.76s)]
*  And I haven't had to take over, but there was one time I was like, well, I'm not doing [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7764.76s)]
*  this right now. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7766.54s)]
*  I'll test it another time. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7767.54s)]
*  Here's what I did do in a Tesla. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7768.58s)]
*  You put it on the ... Self-driving? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7770.22s)]
*  It's not self-driving. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7774.54s)]
*  Auto ... No, just the simple ... What's it called? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7775.54s)]
*  All the old cars had it. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7779.22s)]
*  Cruise control? [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7780.22s)]
*  Yeah, cruise control. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7781.22s)]
*  But it's managed cruise control. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7782.22s)]
*  So I put it at 50 miles an hour. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7784.5s)]
*  The traffic slows to 30. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7786.46s)]
*  It slows to 30 with a prescribed car distance in front of me. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7787.6s)]
*  The traffic goes to a standstill. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7792.78s)]
*  The car stops. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7794.1s)]
*  The traffic picks up. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7795.9s)]
*  The old cars wouldn't do that, right? [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7797.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7798.9800000000005s)]
*  It's doing this. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7799.9800000000005s)]
*  I experiment with that. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7800.9800000000005s)]
*  I noticed that when it starts from a stop or when it slows down, it's way harder on its [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7802.46s)]
*  brakes than I am. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7810.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7811.46s)]
*  I'm way smoother driver than my cruise control. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7812.46s)]
*  I've seen cars come in from the side and it abruptly stops. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7816.740000000001s)]
*  When I saw it before it did ... We're at the beginning. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7820.860000000001s)]
*  It's dawn. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7826.98s)]
*  It's the dawn of this. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7827.98s)]
*  You're recognizing patterns and judgment and whether or not someone's paying attention, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7829.42s)]
*  whether or not it's going to be ... All that has to happen is that it goes into [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7833.7s)]
*  an AI learning mode and it gets the sum of all of these experiences of all drivers in [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7835.66s)]
*  these situations. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7841.66s)]
*  Yeah, AI is going to kill some people in self-driving mode, but I guarantee you ... [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7842.66s)]
*  It's going to kill a lot less. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7847.0599999999995s)]
*  It will kill fewer people than without it. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7848.0599999999995s)]
*  Have you seen Lex Friedman playing guitar while he's driving around in a self-driving [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7853.78s)]
*  car? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7857.58s)]
*  Yeah, Lex drove around in a Tesla while playing guitar. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7858.58s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7861.54s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7862.54s)]
*  It's pretty fascinating. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7863.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7864.54s)]
*  There's a headline here and that ... I'm going to read to a very simple headline, but where [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7865.54s)]
*  is it here? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7872.9s)]
*  T-E ... Oh my gosh. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7873.9s)]
*  Where is it? [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7876.9s)]
*  There it is. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7878.9s)]

*  Oh. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7880.9s)]
*  That's pretty good. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7881.9s)]
*  Lex can shred. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7891.339999999999s)]
*  Give me some of that. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7892.339999999999s)]

*  Oh yeah, he was playing along. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7899.259999999999s)]
*  Here it goes. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7905.219999999999s)]
*  That's good. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7906.219999999999s)]

*  Okay. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7908.219999999999s)]
*  Have you done Lex's podcast? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7909.22s)]
*  No. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7914.22s)]

*  Oh yeah? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7918.22s)]
*  He's an AI researcher from MIT originally, and now he's mostly doing independent work [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7919.22s)]
*  and doing his own podcast. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7925.9800000000005s)]
*  Brilliant, brilliant guy. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7927.9800000000005s)]

*  Uh-huh. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7932.08s)]
*  He's got an amazing podcast too. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7933.08s)]
*  Okay, so here it's going to be in this section here. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7935.06s)]
*  I don't think you're interested in Lex's podcast. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7938.0199999999995s)]
*  Seems like he's not paying attention. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7941.0199999999995s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7942.0199999999995s)]
*  No, hang on. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7943.0199999999995s)]
*  I got this. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7944.0199999999995s)]
*  No, thank you for the tip. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7945.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to get him on, buddy. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7946.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to get him on. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7947.0199999999995s)]
*  Lex actually is one of the most brilliant people I know. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7951.9s)]
*  I think you would love talking to him. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7956.18s)]
*  An interesting quote here from Walter Batchot. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7958.7s)]
*  He wrote, one of the greatest pains to human nature is the pain of a new idea. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7963.38s)]
*  Really? [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7969.38s)]
*  That guy's an idiot. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7970.38s)]
*  That's not the greatest pain. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7972.38s)]
*  Someone needs to kick him in the nuts. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7974.02s)]
*  That's a lot of pain of loss, the pain of failure. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7976.22s)]
*  There's a lot more pains. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7979.14s)]
*  Actually, no. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7980.58s)]
*  The longer quote I have here, just in all fairness to the fellow, is it is, as common [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7981.58s)]
*  people say, so upsetting, it makes you think that after all, your favorite notions may [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7988.74s)]
*  be wrong, your firmest beliefs ill-founded. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7995.78s)]
*  Naturally, therefore, common men hate a new idea and are disposed more or less to ill-treat [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=7998.66s)]
*  the original man who brings it. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8007.86s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8010.66s)]
*  Now we're in the common man thing. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8011.66s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8013.34s)]
*  All right. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8014.34s)]
*  That's 19th century. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8015.34s)]
*  I like that even less. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8016.34s)]
*  All right. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8017.34s)]
*  Ready? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8018.34s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8019.34s)]
*  It's why our brain is not statistically prepared. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8020.34s)]
*  A headline. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8023.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8025.46s)]
*  Tesla says autopilot makes its car safer. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8026.7s)]
*  Crash victims say it kills. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8032.54s)]
*  Both of those are true. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8038.46s)]
*  Yeah, but less. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8040.46s)]
*  It's sort of like introducing mountain lions into areas to kill tears. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8042.5s)]
*  Correct. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8046.46s)]
*  Both of those are true. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8047.62s)]
*  If you keep at it, yes, autopilot will kill, AI self-driver will kill people, but that [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8049.9800000000005s)]
*  number will drop every single year. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8055.9800000000005s)]
*  You know why? [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8057.54s)]
*  Because every way that someone dies, no other person will die that way again because they'll [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8058.54s)]
*  upload all the software and that does not happen. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8063.46s)]
*  This is what the airline industry did. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8067.58s)]
*  The FAA investigates every single crash. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8070.62s)]
*  You know why you can't take lithium ions onto a plane? [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8075.46s)]
*  Because there was a UPS plane that had lithium ion batteries in the cargo and it caught fire. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8078.18s)]
*  There's the audio of the pilots talking to each other and to the thing while the plane [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8086.58s)]
*  is on fire just before the thing crashes. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8093.1s)]
*  Do you remember when they used to make you take the batteries out of Samsung phones when [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8095.42s)]
*  you got on planes? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8098.74s)]
*  I never used a Samsung phone. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8099.74s)]
*  Samsung phones had an issue. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8101.7s)]
*  Okay. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8103.38s)]
*  One of their Galaxy Note. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8104.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, I remember. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8106.3s)]
*  They would burst into flames because they juiced up the battery capacity. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8107.3s)]
*  I remember it. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8109.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8110.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8111.78s)]
*  And they went a little too far. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8112.78s)]
*  Went a little crazy. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8113.78s)]
*  So all I was saying is that- [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8114.78s)]
*  They fixed that now. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8117.26s)]
*  Part of the diversity of who and what we are is who you love. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8118.26s)]
*  What you want to look like. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8124.1s)]
*  This resistance to the gender spectrum concerns me because it's a force of restriction on [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8126.54s)]
*  people's freedom. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8135.94s)]
*  And somewhere I read that America is like pursuit of happiness. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8137.86s)]
*  I read that somewhere, some document, right? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8143.7s)]
*  And so if someone wants to dress in whatever way they want and if it doesn't conform with [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8147.42s)]
*  your, with your binarity, you're going to create a law to prevent them from doing it? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8155.06s)]
*  What is that? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8163.06s)]
*  Are we any longer in a free country if you have that power over me to express my happiness? [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8164.06s)]
*  And another thing we're not good at, and I got to go like soon. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8173.26s)]
*  How long have we been talking here, dude? [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8179.14s)]
*  Couple hours. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8180.660000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8181.660000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8182.660000000001s)]
*  Come on. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8183.660000000001s)]
*  But I love you, man. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8184.66s)]
*  I love you too. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8185.66s)]
*  I love you, man. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8186.66s)]
*  I love you. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8187.66s)]
*  Love you too, man. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8188.66s)]
*  People don't know we were outside wrestling a few moves. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8189.66s)]
*  I used to wrestle. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8193.86s)]
*  I know you used to wrestle. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8194.86s)]
*  I was like captain of my high school team. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8195.86s)]
*  You started to have a little flashback. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8196.86s)]
*  No! [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8199.86s)]
*  It was the third period. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8200.86s)]
*  I was down four points. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8202.46s)]
*  Uh-oh. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8204.06s)]
*  The buzzer. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8205.06s)]
*  So, what was I saying? [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8206.06s)]
*  We're talking about diversity. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8212.02s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8213.02s)]
*  So, here's something. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8214.380000000001s)]
*  This is the concern. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8215.380000000001s)]
*  Another thing we're bad at. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8216.380000000001s)]
*  We're bad at recognizing a spectrum of things when we confront it. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8218.86s)]
*  Our urge is to categorize it. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8224.060000000001s)]
*  That urge is so great. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8226.66s)]
*  We categorize things that are fundamentally not categorizable. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8228.34s)]
*  For example, hurricane strengths. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8232.140000000001s)]
*  Hurricane strength is a continuum of miles per hour of wind speed. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8235.26s)]
*  We cut it into five categories. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8243.06s)]
*  You know what happens? [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8246.34s)]
*  That affects us. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8247.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8248.34s)]
*  So, a hurricane, Hurricane Irma, goes from low category three to high category three. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8249.34s)]
*  They're just, oh, it's just category three, Irma. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8252.58s)]
*  It goes up one mile an hour. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8255.539999999999s)]
*  It's breaking news. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8257.74s)]
*  Hurricane Irma strength into category four just this past hour and everybody crowds around [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8259.539999999999s)]
*  the TV set. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8265.26s)]
*  So, our brain doesn't allow a continuum. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8266.74s)]
*  What happens? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8272.38s)]
*  Are you a boy or are you a girl? [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8273.38s)]
*  You have to be one of, maybe there's a continuum. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8275.38s)]
*  Okay. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8277.339999999998s)]
*  Oh, you want to talk X chromosome, Y chromosome. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8278.339999999998s)]
*  We can do that. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8280.42s)]
*  Fine. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8282.42s)]
*  All right. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8283.42s)]
*  So, biogenetically, I can say that there's a boy and a girl or some variant on that, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8284.42s)]
*  which is in the rare case where you have doubled up on the chromosomes. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8291.06s)]
*  Intersex. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8294.9s)]
*  Yeah, intersex. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8295.9s)]
*  Sure, we can have that conversation. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8296.9s)]
*  That's not visible to me in what you do when you wake up in the morning. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8298.9s)]
*  I don't see your chromosomes. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8304.94s)]
*  You know what I do? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8305.94s)]
*  I see what you do to make yourself look like a boy. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8307.02s)]
*  You go to the gym. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8311.78s)]
*  You'd have wimp muscles if you didn't work out. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8312.78s)]
*  Okay? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8315.82s)]
*  That's what you do because you're a boy. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8316.82s)]
*  You wear boy clothes so that everyone knows you're a boy. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8318.62s)]
*  If it was that obvious you were a boy, you wouldn't have to do all of that. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8322.68s)]
*  So, so much of what we do to split us into this binarity is artificially added on top [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8326.82s)]
*  of the chromosomes. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8337.3s)]
*  So, like I said, if you're a wimpy guy and you go wear man's clothes and you go to the [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8339.34s)]
*  gym because you want to look like a boy. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8345.539999999999s)]
*  If you're a girl, you're a woman and you have hair on your lip, can't have a mustache, you're [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8347.98s)]
*  a girl. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8351.86s)]
*  Got hair between your eyebrows, can't have that, got to remove that. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8352.86s)]
*  Okay? [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8355.58s)]
*  If you're not large enough, get them enlarged as what happens to, what is the number? [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8357.34s)]
*  300,000 rest augmentations a year in the United States. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8361.58s)]
*  Okay? [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8365.86s)]
*  These are huge numbers to make us look more to fit into this binarity. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8366.86s)]
*  And suppose I don't buy into that binarity. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8371.74s)]
*  I say I like the spectrum. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8374.1s)]
*  Someday I feel a little feminine. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8376.7s)]
*  Sometimes I feel I'm not going to wear clothes that way. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8378.46s)]
*  You're going to come after me and say I don't like that. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8380.26s)]
*  I'm going to pass a law. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8382.34s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8383.78s)]
*  That's no longer a free country. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8385.06s)]
*  Is anybody saying that you should pass a law that men can't wear whatever they want or [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8386.18s)]
*  women can't wear whatever they want? [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8389.94s)]
*  No one's really trying to do that. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8391.42s)]
*  There are forces of resistance in society that are strongly preventing it. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8392.42s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8396.220000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that's unfortunate. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8397.220000000001s)]
*  But coming back to this- [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8399.54s)]
*  And by the way, some solutions like which bathroom do you use, there's solutions there. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8400.54s)]
*  Just make unisex bathrooms. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8403.9s)]
*  Every new restaurant in New York City is that. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8405.9s)]
*  So that takes an entire category of people's worries and concerns off the table. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8408.42s)]
*  When we're talking about genetic engineering- [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8412.98s)]
*  By the way, that's in the chapter gender and identity. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8414.98s)]
*  And I didn't even get to color and race. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8421.539999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8424.58s)]
*  Just before I go, I want to read a quick thing from that section. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8425.58s)]
*  Please. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8427.859999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8428.859999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8429.859999999999s)]
*  Finish with your point. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8430.859999999999s)]
*  My wonder is, if you try to look at what human beings are capable of doing now in terms of [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8431.859999999999s)]
*  genetic engineering and what the hopes are, where do you think this leads us if this is [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8437.98s)]
*  allowed, whether or not it's going to be allowed, it's going to happen? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8442.94s)]
*  Where do you think this leads us to? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8447.220000000001s)]
*  When you look at the archetypal alien, what is it? [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8450.900000000001s)]
*  It's got a large head and no sex organs. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8456.82s)]
*  And they never have hair. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8461.5s)]
*  I want a hairy alien one day. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8462.5s)]
*  With a hair do. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8464.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8465.62s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8466.62s)]
*  They're always bald, big eyes. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8467.62s)]
*  1970 afro. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8468.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8469.62s)]
*  What do you think that leads us to? [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8471.060000000001s)]
*  Do you think that leads us to like one uniform shape? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8473.060000000001s)]
*  Or do you think it leads us to everyone looking like Thor? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8477.300000000001s)]
*  Like where does that lead us to? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8480.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but of course, Thor still had to go to the gym. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8482.54s)]
*  But what if there comes a point in time where that's not necessary? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8485.62s)]
*  Sorry, the actor who plays Thor still had to go to the gym. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8488.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8490.380000000001s)]
*  With things like biostat inhibitors, you aware of those? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8491.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8493.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8494.86s)]
*  So if they incorporate that into the human genome, then you're going to have people that [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8495.86s)]
*  have incredible amounts of muscle mass and they don't even have to do anything to achieve [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8499.66s)]
*  it. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8503.34s)]
*  But what you would have done was as a parent or as someone in control, predetermine what [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8504.34s)]
*  they can or should be in life. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8511.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8513.78s)]
*  Whereas in a free world, in a free society, a person's own ambitions should be what guides [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8514.78s)]
*  them. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8519.94s)]
*  Certainly. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8520.94s)]
*  In my opinion. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8521.94s)]
*  And I don't think that's a controversial opinion. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8522.94s)]
*  Certainly. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8524.14s)]
*  I agree with you. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8525.14s)]
*  But my concern is. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8526.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a real concern. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8527.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8528.14s)]
*  I mean, it gets to the point where it's a uniform strategy and that people just start [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8529.619999999999s)]
*  doing that to their children. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8534.66s)]
*  We're talking 100 years now, 1000 years now. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8536.3s)]
*  Way sooner than that. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8538.66s)]
*  50 years easily. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8539.66s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8540.66s)]
*  Where does this go? [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8541.66s)]
*  Easily 50 years. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8542.66s)]
*  Yeah, so you want to have the muscle bound family, but suppose one of them wanted to [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8543.66s)]
*  be a ballet dancer and had to be a little more lanky and elegant. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8545.82s)]
*  What if we get to a point where genetic engineering could be utilized on fully formed adults and [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8549.9s)]
*  you could change the shape of, like, you know, there's people that are transgender. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8556.580000000002s)]
*  What if you could literally become a double X chromosome human being and you will literally [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8561.140000000001s)]
*  have a vagina, literally have breasts, ovulate, have a woman. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8567.86s)]
*  I don't know how that would, I have to think about how that would happen. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8570.86s)]
*  That would be like an extreme limit of controlling your genomes. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8573.54s)]
*  Yeah, so that's a really interesting different world. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8579.5s)]
*  It means you can be whoever you want. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8582.7s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8584.78s)]
*  On Halloween, right? [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8586.02s)]
*  Wherever you want to be. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8587.02s)]
*  What are your thoughts on human neural interfaces? [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8588.02s)]
*  Like things like Neuralink and these technologies that are being proposed that would allow human [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8590.5s)]
*  beings to integrate with technology in a physical way, symbiotically? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8596.18s)]
*  Yeah, so I have a chapter in here called Exploration and Discovery where we talk about the rapid [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8601.300000000001s)]
*  pace of technology and its impact on civilization, which is extraordinary. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8610.26s)]
*  But most predictions are wrong. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8617.5s)]
*  You get it right in the first few years and after a few decades. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8622.9s)]
*  But with new technology, new possibilities emerge that couldn't even be anticipated. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8625.7s)]
*  It comes in from the side. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8629.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8631.14s)]
*  Rather than... [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8632.14s)]
*  Like the internet. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8633.14s)]
*  More of what? [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8634.14s)]
*  Correct, correct. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8635.14s)]
*  There was an ad in 1992, 1993, early 90s from AT&T. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8637.019999999999s)]
*  They had a relatively successful ad campaign where they said, have you ever wanted to ba-de-da-de-da-de-da-de-da? [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8642.58s)]
*  And they say some futuristic thing and they say, you will, AT&T will bring it to you. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8647.98s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen that. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8653.18s)]
*  One of the things, one of the commercials was something I've never wanted to do, never dreamed [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8654.34s)]
*  of doing, never did, and never will do. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8658.859999999999s)]
*  They show a guy on a beach. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8662.5s)]
*  And he's working on a tablet, which was a good predictive thing. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8665.18s)]
*  Tablets did come. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8668.460000000001s)]
*  He's looking at the tablet and said, have you... [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8669.460000000001s)]
*  And there's a surf coming in. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8671.66s)]
*  It was a beautiful beach scene. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8672.66s)]
*  He said, have you ever wanted to send a fax from the beach? [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8674.18s)]
*  Well, you will. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8678.380000000001s)]
*  AT&T will. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8680.380000000001s)]
*  He's like, no, thank you. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8681.380000000001s)]
*  No one has ever in the history of the universe wanted to do that. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8683.460000000001s)]
*  But why wouldn't they if that was all that existed? [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8688.58s)]
*  I'm just saying... [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8691.380000000001s)]
*  But now it's email. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8692.380000000001s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8693.380000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8694.66s)]
*  But you don't see that coming if you're extolling the virtues of faxes. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8695.66s)]
*  That's like in Back to the Future Part II, a film made in 1989, we're riding high in [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8699.14s)]
*  faxes, 89 to the early 90s. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8705.58s)]
*  You know what year that took place, was supposed to take place? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8709.259999999998s)]
*  Back to the Future II. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8712.179999999998s)]
*  It's like modern. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8713.179999999998s)]
*  Yeah, 2015. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8715.179999999998s)]
*  So Marty pisses off his boss and he gets fired. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8717.019999999999s)]
*  The boss communicates this via fax to his residents, except this is the residents of [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8720.5s)]
*  the future. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8726.18s)]
*  He has three fax machines in his home. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8727.18s)]
*  So you see them come out on three different fax machines. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8730.66s)]
*  No matter what room he was in, he would see it because that's the home of the future. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8733.980000000001s)]
*  Because a modern home in 1989 with one fax machine, many homes had no fax machines. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8737.78s)]
*  This is how we're linear thinking people. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8742.94s)]
*  Here's Marty. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8746.02s)]
*  You're fired. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8747.02s)]
*  You're fired. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8748.1s)]
*  There are three different fax machines. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8749.1s)]
*  That's the future. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8751.86s)]
*  There it is. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8752.86s)]
*  That's what they thought. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8753.86s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8754.86s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8755.86s)]
*  The future. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8756.86s)]
*  Wow. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8757.86s)]
*  And so I talk about here how we also have linear brains, which prevents us from seeing [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8758.86s)]
*  exponential change. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8762.220000000001s)]
*  The best example of this is algae on a pond. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8764.220000000001s)]
*  So algae, as it grows and it floats on the pond, you see like one square foot of it and [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8769.9s)]
*  someone tells you the algae is doubling every day. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8775.699999999999s)]
*  And you have this huge pond and you're told this, okay? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8781.019999999999s)]
*  You go away for a month and come back. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8786.179999999998s)]
*  The pond is half covered with algae. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8788.779999999999s)]
*  They say, oh my gosh, I was away for a month and this happened. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8791.98s)]
*  When will it be completely covered? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8797.46s)]
*  So what's the answer? [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8799.859999999999s)]
*  It took a month to get halfway. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8800.859999999999s)]
*  So how much more time? [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8804.54s)]
*  A week? [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8805.54s)]
*  No, a day. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8806.54s)]
*  What did I say? [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8807.54s)]
*  Doubles. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8808.54s)]
*  It doubles every day. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8809.54s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8810.54s)]
*  That's how I started this conversation. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8811.54s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8812.54s)]
*  See, the linear brain overrides even the stated facts. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8813.54s)]
*  You know how they deal with that? [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8818.18s)]
*  They introduce carp. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8819.740000000002s)]
*  Good. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8820.740000000002s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8821.740000000002s)]
*  And carp eat all the algae. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8822.740000000002s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8823.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but then the problem is they eat all the vegetation and you get like Lake Austin. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8824.740000000002s)]
*  There's almost no vegetation and all the bass have no place to hide. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8829.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8833.02s)]
*  Lake Austin looks like the bottom of a swimming pool now. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8834.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8837.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mistake. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8838.66s)]
*  Nothing there. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8839.66s)]
*  Whoops. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8840.66s)]
*  Yeah, you think you know all the causes and effects of things and then you don't. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8841.66s)]
*  Well, when I was on the Big Island, I found out about mongooses. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8845.300000000001s)]
*  Big Island, Hawaii, yeah. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8848.82s)]
*  Yeah, when I was there for the pet concern. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8849.82s)]
*  Can we call them mongooses? [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8850.82s)]
*  Is that allowed? [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8851.82s)]
*  They're so adorable. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8852.82s)]
*  We saw one at the resort, a mongoose. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8853.82s)]
*  Cute little fella. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8855.82s)]
*  Wait, but Hawaii has no snakes. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8856.82s)]
*  So what do the mongooses eat? [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8858.9s)]
*  Unfortunately, they brought them in for rats and they went after ground nesting birds. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8860.42s)]
*  So they've devastated local wildlife. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8864.22s)]
*  There it is. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8867.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8868.18s)]
*  So you're an island in the middle of the Pacific. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8869.18s)]
*  That stuff is pretty tightly configured. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8870.18s)]
*  Those little fellas are so cute. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8871.9s)]
*  Okay, the mongooses found in Hawaii are native to India. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8873.82s)]
*  We were introduced to Hawaiian islands in 1883 by the sugar industry to control rats [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8876.42s)]
*  and sugar cane fields. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8880.94s)]
*  Any species in Hawaii is going to be invasive. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8883.1s)]
*  Then it gets to a point where people are making the argument that wild pigs are no longer [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8886.820000000002s)]
*  invasive because they've been there as long as the humans have. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8890.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so it's only a problem when it's a problem is really what that comes down to. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8893.7s)]
*  I'm told that LA palm trees are not native. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8899.86s)]
*  Right, they're not. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8902.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but they do really well there and they haven't overrun the city or anything. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8903.460000000001s)]
*  Also they're symbolic of Los Angeles, the palm tree. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8906.78s)]
*  Yeah, you got it. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8910.54s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8911.54s)]
*  Okay, so I make a prediction by the year 250. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8912.54s)]
*  I have a bunch of predictions here. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8915.699999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's hear it. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8916.699999999999s)]
*  This is so that in 2050 you can say, Tyson, you had your head up your ass. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8919.34s)]
*  Okay? [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8922.74s)]
*  I have no hesitation because I go through a whole set of predictions that all didn't [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8923.74s)]
*  come out right. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8926.98s)]
*  People predicting 30 years ahead. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8928.179999999998s)]
*  So I just want to join the susceptibility parade here. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8930.859999999999s)]
*  Maybe you'll nail a few. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8934.259999999998s)]
*  Neuroscience and our understanding of the human mind will become so advanced that mental [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8936.939999999999s)]
*  illness will be cured, leaving psychologists and psychiatrists without jobs. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8940.82s)]
*  In a shift that echoes the rapid conversion from horses to automobiles in the early 20th [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8947.42s)]
*  century, self-driving electric vehicles will fully replace all cars and trucks on the road. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8952.38s)]
*  If you want to be nostalgic with your fancy combustion engine sports car, you can drive [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8958.86s)]
*  on specially designed tracks akin to horse riding stables of today. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8963.779999999999s)]
*  The human space program will fully transition to a space industry supported not by tax dollars, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8969.9s)]
*  but by tourism and anything else people dream of doing in space. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8976.98s)]
*  We develop a perfect antiviral serum and cure cancer. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8982.46s)]
*  Medicines will tailor to your own DNA, leaving no adverse side effects. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8987.619999999999s)]
*  And this is in response to your earlier question. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8993.82s)]
*  We will resist the urge to merge the circuitry of computers with the circuitry of our brains. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=8996.619999999999s)]
*  Have you ever seen those statistics? [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9005.1s)]
*  I'm happy enough to just dig it up here. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9006.1s)]
*  No, I don't need to surgically implant this. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9007.9s)]
*  I'm seconds away from all the knowledge of the world that I could possibly want. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9011.42s)]
*  I don't have to surgically implant. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9015.5s)]
*  I don't have that urge. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9017.98s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9018.98s)]
*  If they do increase the capacity for human knowledge and your access to information substantially [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9020.1s)]
*  to the point where someone with a neural interface has an enormous advantage over anybody who [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9025.38s)]
*  doesn't. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9030.3s)]
*  Well, they'll do it faster perhaps. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9031.3s)]
*  But not just faster, but change the way you interface with information. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9032.3s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9035.5s)]
*  And of course, our guy says that, Mr. Singularity. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9036.5s)]
*  Oh, you are? [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9038.859999999999s)]
*  No, no. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9039.859999999999s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil? [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9040.859999999999s)]
*  Ray Kurzweil, right. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9041.859999999999s)]
*  He's a big fan of that. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9042.859999999999s)]
*  Here's a new book where the singularity is nearer. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9043.86s)]
*  His first book was The Singularity Was Near. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9049.66s)]
*  What a prediction. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9052.42s)]
*  We will learn how to regrow lost limbs and failing organs, bringing us up to the level [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9053.42s)]
*  of other regenerating animals on earth like salamanders, starfish, and lobsters. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9059.140000000001s)]
*  Instead of becoming our overlord and enslaving us all, artificial intelligence will be just [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9066.86s)]
*  another helpful feature of the tech infrastructures that serve our daily lives. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9071.58s)]
*  Those are my predictions to be found wrong in 30 years. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9076.34s)]
*  Do you have any fears of artificial general intelligence? [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9079.1s)]
*  No. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9081.9s)]
*  Not at all? [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9082.9s)]
*  I don't think that's where it's going to head. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9083.9s)]
*  Neither does Kurzweil, by the way. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9084.9s)]
*  I think we'll put intelligence in things that need to do things. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9085.9s)]
*  Get the perfect cup of coffee. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9090.0s)]
*  Put it in your car so it drives and doesn't get in an accident. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9091.42s)]
*  Put it in things. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9094.42s)]
*  To have the one thing that does it all, I don't- [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9095.74s)]
*  I would love to hear you talk to Elon about this because he has a deep fear of it. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9097.42s)]
*  I'm anomalous there, so don't listen to me. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9101.699999999999s)]
*  Listen to others. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9103.82s)]
*  You're anomalous in the fact that you're not concerned? [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9104.82s)]
*  Yes. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9106.82s)]
*  If you go to AI experts, most of them are concerned that it poses an existential threat. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9107.82s)]
*  I think it'll just be more stuff that'll help us out. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9112.94s)]
*  But what about when it's used in military applications? [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9115.74s)]
*  Well that is unethical. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9118.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, all military operations involve some ethical decision tree, so it would be added [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9119.619999999999s)]
*  to the ethical decision tree. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9126.34s)]
*  But when you have unethical foreign countries that will use these sort of artificial general- [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9127.54s)]
*  Well, that's anti-tank warfare, so you need ways to combat that. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9133.900000000001s)]
*  It'll escalate. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9136.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9137.660000000002s)]
*  Once it gets live- [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9138.660000000002s)]
*  By the way, the countries have ministers of AI. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9139.660000000002s)]
*  We don't. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9142.060000000001s)]
*  We're behind on that curve. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9143.060000000001s)]
*  I'm worried. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9144.060000000001s)]
*  I'm worried about that. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9145.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9146.060000000001s)]
*  That's the concern, right? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9147.060000000001s)]
*  The concern is that someone else is going to implement it and they're not going to have [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9148.060000000001s)]
*  ethics or morals behind it. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9151.380000000001s)]
*  They're just going to have this idea of control and dominance. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9152.7s)]
*  Correct. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9155.02s)]
*  There's always the bad actor that you've got to ... and the military, they're paid to consider- [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9156.02s)]
*  And the real concern- [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9162.62s)]
*  The conduct of a bad actor. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9163.62s)]
*  Is that we become them to beat them. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9164.78s)]
*  That's the fear. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9169.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9170.54s)]
*  Except we're not autocratic, or we don't think we are. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9171.54s)]
*  So we would have to get an entire Congress, an entire electorate to vote that way. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9176.42s)]
*  And if we do, I don't know what the future of the world will be at that point. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9184.78s)]
*  It's spooky. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9189.58s)]
*  It's spooky because, again, we don't have the ability to extrapolate and look at the [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9190.58s)]
*  future in terms of how all these things are implemented and what the overall result's [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9194.42s)]
*  going to be. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9201.140000000001s)]
*  So you're not worried about these human neural interfaces at all? [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9204.5s)]
*  You don't see that as being- [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9207.34s)]
*  No, I don't see it happening. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9208.34s)]
*  You don't see it happening at all? [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9209.34s)]
*  No. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9210.34s)]
*  I think we'll resist it. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9211.34s)]
*  I think it'll- [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9212.34s)]
*  There's a lot of people that resisted email. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9213.86s)]
*  Like, I don't even have email, man. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9214.86s)]
*  Those people all got on board. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9217.380000000001s)]
*  A lot of people resisted cell phones. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9218.380000000001s)]
*  People used to print their email, remember that? [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9219.380000000001s)]
*  And they print it and then read the printed email. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9221.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9223.78s)]
*  But a lot of people resisted this idea of cell phones, but now they're everywhere. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9224.78s)]
*  The only resistance I'm referring about is the machine biology interface. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9229.94s)]
*  That's what we're going to resist. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9234.5s)]
*  We're not going to resist the continued advance of the technology. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9235.5s)]
*  But if it creates a superior human being- [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9237.78s)]
*  It already has. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9240.380000000001s)]
*  It beats us at chess, at Go, at any intellectual task, we give it. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9241.44s)]
*  It's already superior. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9245.76s)]
*  But I mean, if it's a symbiotic thing, if it becomes integrated with the human biology- [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9246.76s)]
*  I think we'll resist that, that's all. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9251.6s)]
*  It's a prediction that we can- [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9253.52s)]
*  I think you will. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9254.52s)]
*  I'm going to hop on board right away. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9255.52s)]
*  I'm going to be one of the first people. [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9256.52s)]
*  I'm going to drill a hole in my head, Elon. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9257.52s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9260.52s)]
*  The cyborg, implant it. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9261.52s)]
*  I don't want to be left behind. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9262.52s)]
*  Okay. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9263.52s)]
*  Well, the real concern is that it's really going to separate the haves from the have-nots. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9264.52s)]
*  Because if it does give you an advantage economically, an advantage in terms of your [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9267.44s)]
*  intellectual capacity, you're going to have this advantage because it's going to be prohibitively [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9271.2s)]
*  expensive I would assume initially. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9276.44s)]
*  Often things that are prohibitively expensive initially don't forever stay that way. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9278.480000000001s)]
*  Right, like cell phones. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9283.68s)]
*  Of course. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9284.68s)]
*  But eventually it becomes- [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9285.68s)]
*  Or flat panel TVs. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9286.68s)]
*  Sure. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9287.68s)]
*  Do like impulse items at Kmart. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9288.68s)]
*  I was just at Walmart. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9289.68s)]
*  I can't believe how cheap they are now. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9290.68s)]
*  50 inch TV. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9292.28s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9293.28s)]
*  Yes, it's nuts. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9294.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9295.28s)]
*  They were so expensive. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9296.28s)]
*  Like 20 grand. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9298.12s)]
*  Yes, tens of thousands of dollars. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9299.12s)]
*  And they'd come in like wood crates. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9300.12s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9302.12s)]
*  And now you can- [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9303.12s)]
*  You needed power tools to undo it. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9304.12s)]
*  You can do it yourself and mount them yourself on the wall. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9306.12s)]
*  I got to- let me leave you with some thoughts here. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9308.12s)]
*  Okay, please do. [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9310.44s)]
*  There's a section here on race and color, which is another thing with the variation [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9311.44s)]
*  of what we have in the world. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9316.6s)]
*  Just a point I want to make. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9317.6s)]
*  When European anthropologists started running through Africa and started describing what [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9319.84s)]
*  they saw, their urge was to say, everyone in Africa is this thing. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9324.88s)]
*  And they have dark skin, wooly hair, and that is a thing. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9331.279999999999s)]
*  And they called it a race and they called it the Negroes. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9336.119999999999s)]
*  Okay? [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9338.88s)]
*  And this is our attempt to classify into few categories something that might actually, [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9340.24s)]
*  in real life, be on a spectrum. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9347.3s)]
*  We know that the human species began in Africa. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9350.44s)]
*  And everybody who populates everywhere else in the world came out of Africa to do that. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9356.52s)]
*  What that tells you is that the genetic diversity within Africa as the origin of our species [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9363.720000000001s)]
*  than it is between any other two people anywhere else in the world. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9376.4s)]
*  But because the anthropologists were not thinking genetic diversity, they're thinking skin color. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9383.56s)]
*  They put them all in one bin. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9391.32s)]
*  But if you have the most genetic diversity, then in practically every way humans vary, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9393.74s)]
*  you would find the extreme of that in the African continent. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9400.44s)]
*  Where would you find the tallest people in the world? [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9405.6s)]
*  The Watusi tribe of Africa. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9408.24s)]
*  How about the shortest people in the world? [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9411.560000000001s)]
*  The Pygmies. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9413.880000000001s)]
*  The Pygmies. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9414.880000000001s)]
*  Not even that far away. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9415.880000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9416.880000000001s)]
*  Geographically. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9417.880000000001s)]
*  They have the same skin color, so the Europeans said these are one group of people, one race. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9418.880000000001s)]
*  Where might you find the slowest people in the world? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9427.04s)]
*  Well, no one looks for them. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9430.039999999999s)]
*  Where would you find, there's no races to find the slowest people. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9432.519999999999s)]
*  How about the fastest people? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9434.96s)]
*  Africa. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9437.16s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9438.16s)]
*  People of African descent have dominated the long distance as well as the sprint to completely [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9439.16s)]
*  different physical abilities. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9445.14s)]
*  Oh, but they're all dark-skinned people. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9446.839999999998s)]
*  They're all Negroes. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9448.759999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9450.359999999999s)]
*  Where would you likely find the dumbest person in the world? [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9451.359999999999s)]
*  Africa. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9455.759999999998s)]
*  How about the smartest person in the world? [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9457.039999999999s)]
*  Africa. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9459.8s)]
*  How about the Egyptians? [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9460.8s)]
*  The Europeans did not look for people smarter than they were. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9462.72s)]
*  Okay. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9468.439999999999s)]
*  And to this day, where they find evidence where that might have been the case, you have [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9469.439999999999s)]
*  people saying aliens did it. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9474.199999999999s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9476.84s)]
*  Egypt is, of course, in Africa. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9477.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9480.439999999999s)]
*  A brilliant civilization. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9481.439999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9483.679999999998s)]
*  Well, Europeans were still either disemboweling heretics or whatever the hell they were doing. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9485.8s)]
*  That was even before that, thousands of years ago. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9491.759999999998s)]
*  So my point is, if you don't look for it and you don't find it and you're going to create [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9497.039999999999s)]
*  a map of humans of the world, you're going to put yourself at the top. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9502.16s)]
*  That's what you're going to do. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9507.4s)]
*  And you're going to write things like this. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9508.4s)]
*  Who do you want to hear from? [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9511.679999999998s)]
*  Thomas Jefferson or Francis Galton? [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9514.92s)]
*  Jefferson. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9517.68s)]
*  Jefferson. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9518.68s)]
*  1785. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9519.68s)]
*  Speaking of the Negroes, comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9521.68s)]
*  it appears to me that in memory, they are equal to the whites. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9529.0s)]
*  In reason, much inferior. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9533.28s)]
*  As I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9536.16s)]
*  of Euclid. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9543.44s)]
*  And in imagination, they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9545.44s)]
*  What is Euclid? [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9551.4s)]
*  I honestly don't know how many Euclid fluent white people Jefferson knew in the original [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9554.480000000001s)]
*  American colonies. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9559.880000000001s)]
*  Euclid invented geometry. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9561.2s)]
*  Okay, Euclidean geometry is ancient Greece. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9563.640000000001s)]
*  And his books still exist to this day. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9567.960000000001s)]
*  So he's saying the black slaves don't know Euclid, can't figure out Euclid. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9570.64s)]
*  Well they haven't been educated. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9575.599999999999s)]
*  Regardless, how many white farmers in 1785 USA also knew Euclid? [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9577.599999999999s)]
*  Zero. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9584.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9585.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9586.599999999999s)]
*  But whatever were his observations and objections to black people, he had no hesitation continually [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9587.599999999999s)]
*  mating with at least one of them, producing six children. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9594.4s)]
*  So you know what I did here? [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9600.44s)]
*  Then there's a guy who wrote a whole book comparing black people and white people, a [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9603.32s)]
*  book that was used into the 1960s. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9608.480000000001s)]
*  It was called The Origin of Races by Carlton Kuhn. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9610.76s)]

*  Here's one. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9769.16s)]
*  In 2021, a talented chess player reached the title of national master for having achieved [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9770.64s)]
*  a US Chess Federation rating above 2200, landing among the top 4% of 350,000 rated players [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9775.6s)]
*  in the world. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9783.56s)]
*  A rating achieved that was 500 points higher than that of a chess coach just a few years [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9784.56s)]
*  after learning how to play the game. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9791.68s)]
*  That prodigy is a 10 year old boy named Tani Talua Adewumi, the son of Nigerian refugees [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9794.36s)]
*  to the USA in 2017. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9804.16s)]
*  His family spent a brief time living in homeless shelters in New York City before his parents [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9807.24s)]
*  established stable employment and permanent residence. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9811.460000000001s)]
*  I played a brief chess game against the little fellow in March 2021 on Grandmaster Maurice [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9814.6s)]
*  Ashley's Twitch platform, a live streaming social media interface. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9821.8s)]
*  The game was indeed brief. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9826.8s)]
*  Yeah, he wiped the floor with me. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9829.4s)]
*  Speaking of Nigerians, immigrants to the US enjoy an 8% higher household income than the [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9832.96s)]
*  national average Nigerian immigrants to the United States. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9843.08s)]
*  And ethnic Nigerian children in the United Kingdom, especially those from the Igbo tribe, [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9846.679999999998s)]
*  consistently attain higher test scores on average than their white UK counterparts. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9852.68s)]
*  What is it about Nigeria? [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9857.960000000001s)]
*  Occasions to pause and wonder what depths of intellectual capital in math, science, [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9858.960000000001s)]
*  and engineering or any field lay hidden deep within the African continent or anywhere else [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9869.720000000001s)]
*  on earth, lost for now or lost forever. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9876.92s)]
*  We never want of an opportunity to flourish. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9881.56s)]
*  I'm going to leave you with a fast list. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9884.56s)]
*  I want to tell you what my racist black anthropologist found. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9887.88s)]
*  Let's go back to the 19th century. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9892.84s)]
*  Let all anthropologists be black racists instead of white racists. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9894.72s)]
*  OK? [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9898.6s)]
*  OK. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9899.6s)]
*  What would they say? [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9900.6s)]
*  So all right. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9902.6s)]
*  Chimpanzees are humans closest genetic relative. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9906.68s)]
*  We just need to find similarities between chimps and white people. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9910.76s)]
*  And that would be surefire evidence of their less evolved state. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9914.58s)]
*  Because that's what people were saying. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9918.86s)]
*  The blacks were still evolving and they show a chimp, a black person, and a white person. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9920.26s)]
*  And so that's you can enslave black people and laws against them. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9924.6s)]
*  It would way to justify it because of course you're going to put yourself at the top. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9929.3s)]
*  So now hypothetical black racist anthropologist. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9932.84s)]
*  Chimps and other apes. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9938.619999999999s)]
*  So this is a list. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9940.58s)]
*  This is in a book that was never written. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9941.58s)]
*  Chimps and other apes grow hair all over their bodies. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9945.02s)]
*  The hairiest people you've ever seen have been white people with mats of hair across [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9949.02s)]
*  their chests and ascending their backs. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9955.42s)]
*  Their body hair can even reach upward and out of their shirt collar. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9958.140000000001s)]
*  Black people do not remotely approximate this level of hairiness. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9962.5s)]
*  There was no mention of this in any of those books. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9966.62s)]
*  Distinct from their face, hands, and feet, part the hair of most chimpanzees the way [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9972.42s)]
*  they do to each other when checking for lice. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9976.980000000001s)]
*  And their skin color is white, not any shade of black or brown. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9979.52s)]
*  Chimps tend to have big ears relative to their head size. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9987.26s)]
*  After decades of ear watching, I can attest that the biggest ears I've ever seen on humans [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9991.78s)]
*  have been on white people. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9996.980000000001s)]
*  Have a look yourself next time you're in a crowded public place. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=9998.980000000001s)]
*  Doubtless there's strong overlap, but the size of black people's ears can be as little [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10003.42s)]
*  as half the size of white people's ears. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10007.980000000001s)]
*  You might now ask about the famously large ears of President Barack Obama. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10012.66s)]
*  But he is precisely half white, just as much white as black. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10018.1s)]
*  So maybe his big ears come from the white half of his family. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10023.140000000001s)]
*  For most of the 20th century, Neanderthals were portrayed as stupid and brutish. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10028.220000000001s)]
*  Turns out beginning in the 1990s, genetic research revealed that Europeans are between [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10034.66s)]
*  1 and 3 percent Neanderthal. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10040.26s)]
*  Africans 0 percent. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10044.220000000001s)]
*  That can't be good for Europeans. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10046.58s)]
*  Time to clean up that backward primitive image. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10049.58s)]
*  Since then, published references to Neanderthals instead comment on what must have been their [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10053.26s)]
*  creative artistic inventive and articulate ways, crafting sophisticated tools and technologies [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10058.66s)]
*  to shape their world. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10066.18s)]
*  Look how easy it is to be racist. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10069.06s)]
*  Let's continue. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10071.74s)]
*  These invest quality family time pruning each other's hair. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10074.94s)]
*  We've all watched them do this. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10078.66s)]
*  Apparently the lice they find must be tasty because whoever plucks them from the other [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10081.460000000001s)]
*  chimp's head also eats them. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10085.78s)]
*  Ever hear of a lice outbreak among black children? [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10088.9s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10093.02s)]
*  White children are 30 times more susceptible to lice infestation than are black children. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10094.300000000001s)]
*  The parasite simply likes to lay eggs in the hair of chimpanzees and white people more [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10101.38s)]
*  than on the hair of black people. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10106.98s)]
*  This goes on. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10108.9s)]
*  This could have been included and they would have said, well wait a minute, maybe all humans [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10112.3s)]
*  are together and chimps are something completely different. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10116.46s)]
*  But they didn't go there. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10120.699999999999s)]
*  Their bias prevented their analysis of information that stares flat into their face. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10122.96s)]
*  Okay. [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10130.58s)]
*  Here's one. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10131.58s)]
*  I'm going to skip some here because I got to go. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10132.58s)]
*  I got a plane waiting for me. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10136.78s)]
*  I'm skipping some here. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10140.86s)]
*  Ready? [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10142.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10144.539999999999s)]
*  This is one more from the chimp vault. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10147.5s)]
*  I have others that are not chimp related. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10149.14s)]
*  Here's one. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10150.66s)]
*  Chimpanzees love to swing in trees. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10152.5s)]
*  So do suburban white children. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10158.1s)]
*  They typically can't wait to build and live in a backyard treehouse. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10161.140000000001s)]
*  You have not likely seen black children even contemplate the idea. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10166.380000000001s)]
*  White people clearly want to return to their fully primitive state. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10173.06s)]
*  This would be a racist black person. [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10177.78s)]
*  Okay. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10180.06s)]
*  This is from the 19th century publishing trying to find ways to enslave white people. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10181.06s)]
*  That's a cosmic perspective. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10187.34s)]
*  That's a look, dude. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10189.14s)]
*  This is what we were doing as humans to each other, not recognizing authentic diversity [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10191.939999999999s)]
*  in who and what we are. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10196.74s)]
*  Trying to separate to say, I'm better. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10198.619999999999s)]
*  I make the rules and whatever rule I'm making, I'm going to put myself at the top and you're [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10201.34s)]
*  not going to be at the top because you're different. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10206.019999999999s)]
*  Do you anticipate that as people get more education, more information, and as we evolve [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10209.14s)]
*  that we'll stop doing that and we'll start recognizing the importance of diversity? [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10217.5s)]
*  I want to believe that. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10224.18s)]
*  And that it's our strength? [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10225.42s)]
*  I want to believe that. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10226.66s)]
*  I want to believe that too. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10227.66s)]
*  I so want to believe that. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10228.66s)]
*  Okay. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10231.42s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10232.42s)]
*  Then I really got to go. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10235.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10236.18s)]
*  Last one. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10237.18s)]
*  This is a quote, a short quote from Horace Mann, 200 years ago. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10238.220000000001s)]
*  I want this on my tombstone. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10243.58s)]
*  I beseech you, nobody uses beseech anymore, I love it. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10245.9s)]
*  I beseech you to treasure up in your hearts these my parting words. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10248.98s)]
*  Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10255.380000000001s)]
*  Our primal urge to keep looking up is surely greater than our primal urge to keep killing [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10263.5s)]
*  one another. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10270.259999999998s)]
*  If so, then human curiosity and wonder, the twin chariots of cosmic discovery, will ensure [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10272.419999999998s)]
*  that starry messages, these are messages from science, from the sky, from the universe, [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10279.22s)]
*  continue to arrive. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10285.5s)]
*  These insights compel us for our short time on earth to become better shepherds of our [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10287.36s)]
*  own civilization. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10293.640000000001s)]
*  Yes, life is better than death. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10295.36s)]
*  Life is also better than having never been born. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10298.32s)]
*  But each of us is alive against stupendous odds. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10301.480000000001s)]
*  We won the lottery only once. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10305.720000000001s)]
*  We get to invoke our faculties of reason to figure out how the world works. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10308.400000000001s)]
*  But we also get to smell the flowers. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10313.52s)]
*  We get to bask in divine sunsets and sunrises and gaze deeply into the night sky they cradle. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10316.76s)]
*  We get to live and ultimately die in this glorious universe. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10324.72s)]
*  That's a hell of a tombstone. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10329.52s)]
*  Dude, I gotta run. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10331.52s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10333.12s)]
*  One day I'll come back and just chill. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10334.12s)]
*  We'll lift weights together. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10336.16s)]
*  Okay. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10337.32s)]
*  Wrestle a few rounds. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10338.32s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10339.32s)]
*  You know. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10340.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10341.32s)]
*  Appreciate you. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10342.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10343.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8_vmWakyn4&t=10344.32s)]
