# Joe Rogan Experience #1895 - Matt Walsh
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo)
*  Hello, Matt Walsh. Joe Rogan. Nice to meet you. Yeah, you too. Officially. Your documentaries, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=0.0s)]
*  I can't tell you how many people have asked me if I've seen it. I think it's one of the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=21.92s)]
*  most eye-opening things that's ever been done on this whole gender confusion thing that we're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=28.22s)]
*  going through right now in our culture. And it was just like one of those things where I had [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=36.06s)]
*  to watch, like so many people were like, you have to see this. You have to see this. And I expected [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=41.260000000000005s)]
*  it to be like, I mean, I thought it would be like arguments with people or it would be very, you [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=46.82s)]
*  know, very confrontational. But instead, I think you did it masterfully. What you did is you just [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=52.779999999999994s)]
*  let these people explain themselves the way they would talk if you weren't there, the way they would [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=59.22s)]
*  talk to people who agree with what they're saying. And by not pushing back, I think you allowed them [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=66.3s)]
*  to let all the crazy out. And it's like, it's hard to describe to people that aren't aware of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=72.22s)]
*  what's going on, of how wild this stuff has gotten. But first of all, tell me, what was the process of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=82.62s)]
*  making this? Like how long did it take? What was the motivation behind it? Yeah, thanks for talking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=89.42s)]
*  about it so much on your podcast, by the way. It's been a huge boost for us. And we, you know, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=97.58s)]
*  I had this idea, you'd really have to go back several years, because it occurred to me maybe [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=102.38s)]
*  back in, I don't know, 2017, that when this transgender stuff was starting to really gain [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=107.42s)]
*  mainstream traction, which I think happened really, that was like, maybe when Bruce Jenner became [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=113.7s)]
*  Caitlyn Jenner, that was the moment that I think it exploded onto the mainstream. Not when it began, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=119.3s)]
*  but it exploded into mainstream. Right around that time, it sort of occurred to me that the people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=124.18s)]
*  promoting this stuff have a problem, which is that we're supposed to accept someone like Bruce [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=130.9s)]
*  as a woman. But then what exactly does that mean? What are we accepting him as? He says, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=138.18s)]
*  I identify as a woman. Well, what are you identifying as? What are we, if you're a woman, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=142.42000000000002s)]
*  I know what a woman was before. But if now we're including a guy like Bruce, then what is a woman [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  now? And so I started asking this question, it was really basic, just like, what is a woman? What [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=153.22s)]
*  are you trying to say about womanhood now? And I couldn't get anyone to answer it. I mean, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=157.62s)]
*  mostly it's just on Twitter, you know, and challenging someone on the left, just give me [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=161.78s)]
*  a definition. What's your definition of the word? And none of them would do it. So at a certain point, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=165.94s)]
*  I thought, well, we have to find a way to go out and put this question in front of them. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=172.02s)]
*  And that's sort of where the idea for the documentary came from. And we knew going in [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=178.02s)]
*  that we wanted two things, well, three things. One is we have the mission behind it, the message [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=181.62s)]
*  that we want to get across. But we also want it to be a piece of entertainment, you know, because a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=188.18s)]
*  lot of conservative documentaries, not all of them, but many of them are just that you feel like you're [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=193.3s)]
*  watching an extended version of a podcast or something. It's not a piece of entertainment. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=199.62s)]
*  So we wanted it to be that. And then we also knew that the way this is going to work, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=204.18s)]
*  if it works at all, is if I'm just asking questions. Because if it's me going on a tour [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=208.74s)]
*  around the country yelling at people, that would be satisfying for me emotionally, but it just [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=214.42000000000002s)]
*  it wouldn't prove anything other than what people already know, which is that two sides yell at each [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=220.10000000000002s)]
*  other. So we wanted to give sort of gender ideology a chance to hang itself by its own [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=224.02s)]
*  incoherences, which I think is what happened. I think you definitely accomplished that. And [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=230.58s)]
*  that it's so funny that that question, what is a woman is so difficult to answer. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=237.06s)]
*  And then they'll say, well, someone who identifies as a woman. And you say, well, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=241.62s)]
*  what does that mean, though? Right. And then they want to just stop talking. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=245.7s)]
*  Like, what was the politician that actually had you leave his office when you? Yeah, we actually [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=250.18s)]
*  we had a couple that stormed out, but only one made it on on camera. And that was the that was [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=255.94s)]
*  Mark Taccano, a congressman in California. And he's one of the he's one of the advocates. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=260.58000000000004s)]
*  There's a reason why there's a reason we chose all these people. It wasn't just random. He's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=266.34000000000003s)]
*  an advocate. He's not just a Democrat politician. He's an advocate for the Equality Act, which is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=269.94s)]
*  this push by Democrats to kind of federalize all this stuff on a national level so that all [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=275.38s)]
*  across the country, for example, men have the right to use a women's restroom and opens up [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=281.70000000000005s)]
*  all the sports teams and all that just settles it takes it away from the states. And so he's an [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=286.02000000000004s)]
*  advocate of that. And he's a good guy to talk to. And we he sat there for about 30 minutes, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=289.06s)]
*  especially when I'm asking him the easy questions and he would give his filibustering [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=295.54s)]
*  answer. But then once I started asking real questions, that's when he got really uncomfortable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=300.26s)]
*  You could even see in the film. He keeps looking over my shoulder, and that's because his aide is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=304.66s)]
*  standing right behind my back the entire time. And but she never I was I kept expecting her to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=310.26s)]
*  cut it off and shut it down, but she never did. And eventually he just had enough of it and he [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=316.58s)]
*  got up and left. But the thing that made him leave was I didn't even get to ask him what is [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=320.5s)]
*  a woman question. I asked him I asked him, you know, there are males who want to use the women's [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=323.46s)]
*  restroom or the women's locker room. But then there are females who don't want to see an individual [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=330.34s)]
*  with a penis in the locker room. So you've got two competing claims here, two people who have [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=334.9s)]
*  feelings, the women who feel like they don't want to see this. It makes them feel bad to see it. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=340.41999999999996s)]
*  And then the men who it makes them feel bad if they can't use the restroom. So who wins out? How [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=344.82s)]
*  do you balance that? I think it's a fair question. It's a very good question. And that's when he just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=348.26s)]
*  got up and said the interview's over and walked out. Well, in those scenarios, we're this is where [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=351.78s)]
*  women particularly feminists who have always been like hardcore lefties, they're like they're [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  finding themselves in this ideological quagmire. Yeah, they're like they're they're feminists. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=364.02s)]
*  They're pro women's rights. They're on the left. And they're not anti trans. But then all of a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=369.46s)]
*  sudden, this is getting imposed into their world. And they're told they have to accept it, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=374.41999999999996s)]
*  or they're transphobic, regardless of this person's sexual history. Like if this person is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=379.62s)]
*  a sexual abuser, if this person is a like a literally registered sex offender, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=386.26s)]
*  they can go into certain places dress like a woman and use women's spaces. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=394.02s)]
*  So we spa case and yes, that's exactly what it is. It's like, it mean, there's so many instances [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=398.42s)]
*  of people gaming the system, right? There's the prisoner who went to jail and immediately [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=404.34000000000003s)]
*  decided they were trans and impregnated two prisoners while they're in there. Yeah, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=409.3s)]
*  that's happening all over the country, by the way. Yeah, these women have no you want to talk about [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=413.3s)]
*  giving a voice to the voices. These women have no voice. They're in prison. What are they who are [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=417.22s)]
*  they supposed to talk to? And, and they're getting locked in. Can you imagine that your woman most [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=420.42s)]
*  and many women who are in jail are in jail for nonviolent offenses. And now they're in locked in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=426.34s)]
*  a cage 24 hours a day with men, many of them are sex offenders. Well, that guy was a murderer. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=433.06s)]
*  Yeah, and that guy had murdered his foster care father. And the the cops who went to the crime [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=438.9s)]
*  scene said it was the worst murder they'd ever seen. He'd been stabbed from his face down to his [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=446.34s)]
*  ankles. Like his he'd just been stabbed an insane amount of times just a blood bath. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=451.54s)]
*  This is the person that just decided right after getting arrested, they identify as a woman. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=457.94s)]
*  And you know, the other thing to keep in mind, too, is that, yeah, there are men who are just [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=463.62s)]
*  gaming the system, as you point out, I think in prison, that's that happens a lot, because they'd [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=467.78000000000003s)]
*  rather be in a women's prison than a men's prison. But also in general, like there are different [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=471.62s)]
*  categories of people who who transition, and we kind of talk about them like they're all the same, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=477.22s)]
*  but they're not. And you can kind of break it down by age, like there's the very young children, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=483.54s)]
*  a five year old, and we hear that, oh, my five year old is trans. That's 1000% the parent just [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=488.1s)]
*  deciding they're going to do that to the child because no child is gonna make no child even [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=493.70000000000005s)]
*  knows what that is. So you have to you have to suggest that to them. Then you have the adolescent [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=496.34000000000003s)]
*  girls and you know, Abigail Shrier is written about this in her great book. And that's the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=499.94000000000005s)]
*  social contagion. They pick it up from society. But then there's the older men who are adults and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=503.86s)]
*  decide one day that they're women. And for so many of them, this is a fetish. I mean, this is like the [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=509.22s)]
*  the thing we're not allowed to say or acknowledge, but it's totally true that for most of the most [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=515.86s)]
*  these older men who decide that I'm a woman, it's a fetish. It's auto-gynophilia. They're they're [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=519.7s)]
*  enchanted by the idea of themselves as women. And so now now we have to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=525.0600000000001s)]
*  participate in your fetish. Like you you get off on the idea of being seen as a woman. And I have to [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=529.3s)]
*  be I have to be a participant in that. It's really it's really degrading to all of us, you know, that [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=535.3s)]
*  we're all being forced into this. Well, it's always been a psychological condition. It's always been [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=542.18s)]
*  known as being like a psychiatric condition. Like it's a mental health issue. Right. And now it's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=547.6199999999999s)]
*  being accepted as a gender identity issue where it was always just like a weird kink that people had. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  And now you're again, regardless whether or not this person's a sex offender, registered sex offender, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=561.22s)]
*  repeated sex offender, you have to accept this. Otherwise, you're a bigot. It's just this this [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=567.5400000000001s)]
*  rigid adherence to ideology is so cult like it's so wide, so fucking hands made tail. It's so wild [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=574.0200000000001s)]
*  that people are just wholesale adopting this. And this is not to deny that there's people that [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=581.3s)]
*  are trans. I've met people that are trans. It exists in nature. I mean, you occasionally guys [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=587.06s)]
*  will shoot a buck and they'll find out that it's actually a female with antlers. Nature is weird. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=592.5s)]
*  Right. I think nature does put people make humans for whatever reason that really feel like they [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=598.26s)]
*  should have been born a female or should have been born a male. But that's not all of what's [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=607.22s)]
*  happening. And in our desire to be compassionate and to have care for these people and to love [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=612.74s)]
*  these people and respect these people, we're opening the door to all this chaos. Yeah. And [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=621.86s)]
*  I think that's what you highlight so well in this film. And it's just, it's so strange to me how so [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=627.46s)]
*  many people on the left, people that I, you know, before this, I generally respected their opinion, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=633.86s)]
*  just buy into it wholesale and will spout out things as if they're facts about how much this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=640.42s)]
*  helps people and keeps people from killing themselves and helps kids. But it's not true. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=647.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's not true. And the suicide stuff is so, it's just so sinister because this is the [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=654.1800000000001s)]
*  emotional blackmail that they tell parents that, you know, your daughter identifies as your son now [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=659.62s)]
*  and then the classic line, the now classic line is would you rather have a dead daughter or a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=667.3s)]
*  living son? Like you have to affirm this or your daughter's going to kill himself. And so many [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=672.02s)]
*  parents, especially, you know, you go back a couple of years when this conversation wasn't being had on [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=675.78s)]
*  a very visible level, they just, they don't know what to do. They're panicked and they've just been [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=680.34s)]
*  told by a mental health provider who they trust that if they don't go along with their child's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=685.46s)]
*  delusion that their child's gonna commit suicide. So I can understand when you're told that, that [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=690.02s)]
*  you're going to kind of panic, but it's just, it's not true. The evidence in fact tells us the [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=696.02s)]
*  opposite, that suicidality, we cover this in the film, Scott Nugent mentions it, that the only [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=701.22s)]
*  reliable long-term study we have on this shows that suicidality is the highest after, years after [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=707.5400000000001s)]
*  transition. That's the highest point for suicidality among trans people. But the other problem too is [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=712.9s)]
*  that, is that there are a couple of maybe reliable long-term studies, but there aren't that many [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=716.9s)]
*  because we haven't done this to people on this scale ever before in human history. So the current [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=721.38s)]
*  crop of especially trans, quote unquote trans kids, they're the, the guinea pigs, they're the, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=726.98s)]
*  we're experimenting on them and they're making a lot of the, the healthcare providers are making a [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=732.5s)]
*  lot of promises about how this is going to turn out when they can't possibly know this because [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=737.38s)]
*  we've never done it before. Well that's the one of the more sinister aspects of it for me, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=741.62s)]
*  is the way they're encouraging hormone blockers and hormone transition for people that are going [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=745.94s)]
*  through puberty or haven't gone through puberty. We don't have any long-term studies on this and [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=751.54s)]
*  now they're finding that these hormone blockers aren't innocuous and that they, they cause a lot [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=757.3s)]
*  of health problems and they're, they're saying this now out in the open when people have been [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=762.18s)]
*  for years, the last few years promoting this as if it's a pause button. And that's, and it's just [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=768.18s)]
*  absurd because that's not, that's not how human biology works. No. I think there's a lot, a lot [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=774.42s)]
*  of what they claim, it just, it shouldn't, intuitively it doesn't make any sense. It defies common sense [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=777.9399999999999s)]
*  even before you look at the data and then you look at the data and you realize that yeah, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=782.8199999999999s)]
*  it doesn't make any sense, but even before that you can't, what, what's being claimed that you can kind [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=785.54s)]
*  of put a child in a state of suspended animation where they're, they're kind of lingering on, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=790.0999999999999s)]
*  on pause. That's not how the human body works. If you, what you can do is try to suppress the [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=797.54s)]
*  human body's normal natural functions. But when you do that, it's a trade-off. There are consequences. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  There are always consequences. That's how nature works. And, and we also know that what are the [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=807.86s)]
*  drugs they use? Like Lupron is a drug that uses a puberty blocker. And it's just a fact that this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=812.74s)]
*  drug, number one, to begin with is a cancer drug originally for, for, for older men who have prostate [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=817.54s)]
*  cancer. And, and they've also used it to chemically castrate sex offenders. I think in Georgia, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=822.02s)]
*  they've used it for that purpose. So it's an actual chemical castration drugs, drug used off label [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=828.66s)]
*  for, you know, 10 year old, 11 year old, 12 year old kids. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=835.46s)]
*  With no long-term data. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=838.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=840.34s)]
*  And they're- [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=840.74s)]
*  Because they can't be. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=841.22s)]
*  They're promoting it as this is the silver bullet. This is going to fix you. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=842.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=845.78s)]
*  This is the thing that's going to fix all your ales. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=846.1s)]
*  And the other thing they do is they say that, well, we don't, as this conversation has grown about [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=848.58s)]
*  actual surgery for children, which is happening all across the country, but what they always say is [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=854.74s)]
*  well, that's not, you know, that's not really what's happening, especially younger kids. We just, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=858.26s)]
*  it's puberty blockers, not surgery. And yeah, it might be true that they're not performing actual [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=861.46s)]
*  surgeries on 12 year olds at this point. You know, at least that hasn't, that's not a common [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=865.38s)]
*  practice, but what they don't tell you is that once you put the kid on this conveyor belt, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=869.78s)]
*  they're going to probably stay on it all the way to the surgery. You've put them in the system. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=875.7s)]
*  You've put them on, it is like a conveyor belt system and they're most likely not going to jump [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=879.7800000000001s)]
*  off. You start with the puberty blockers in almost every case it's going to lead to the, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=884.2600000000001s)]
*  to hormone therapy. And then in a great many cases they go from there to, to surgery. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=888.1s)]
*  The other thing too is that you've, as you're, as they're going along with these drugs, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=893.3000000000001s)]
*  you are taking away, you're sterilizing them. You're, you're oftentimes permanently taking [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=897.3000000000001s)]
*  away their future fertility. So, you know, you've taken away their capacity to like a girl, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=902.74s)]
*  you've, you've, you've made it so she'll never be able to have kids in the future. You've already [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=909.54s)]
*  taken that from her. She has given it up before she even could know what she's even given up. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=913.38s)]
*  And then for her, it's kind of a logical process. Well, I've already given that up, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=918.9s)]
*  so I might as well go get the double mastectomy and then all down the line. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=921.22s)]
*  And then there's the euphoria that comes with taking testosterone that happens to them, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=925.7s)]
*  like almost immediately they have a different feeling and they go, oh, this is how I should [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=930.1s)]
*  have been all along. Now the medicine is helping me. It's, it's also, if someone identifies [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=933.7s)]
*  as male or identifies as female and this is just how they feel they are, what is, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=941.38s)]
*  like what's the logical argument for starting to give them hormones that are not natural in [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=948.82s)]
*  their system? I don't think there is a logical argument. The only argument you ever hear from [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=953.7s)]
*  them, and I know because I've asked, is the emotional blackmail argument that you just, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=961.94s)]
*  you have to do it because if you don't, they're going to kill it. But another point about the [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=967.46s)]
*  suicide thing I want to mention is that, you know, we know that trans identification has risen, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=971.62s)]
*  in the youngest generation, has risen like 20 or 30 fold, right? And what they tell us on the left [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=977.38s)]
*  is that, well, that's not social contagion. This is just people now feel comfortable to live their [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=983.3s)]
*  truth. So there's always been this many trans people. It's just that in the past they couldn't [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=988.66s)]
*  announce that to the world because it was, it was an unaffirming society. So they tell you, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=993.78s)]
*  well, if that's true and you had, you had like millions of trans people in the past who are [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=997.8599999999999s)]
*  living in these unaffirming societies. And we're also told that if you don't affirm trans people, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1002.5799999999999s)]
*  it leads to suicide. Then shouldn't we see if we look back through history, just this unbroken [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1006.66s)]
*  mass epidemic across the world of people killing themselves in mass because they're not being [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1012.1s)]
*  affirmed as trans, that's not what we find. Shouldn't we see like, you know, you should, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1017.46s)]
*  you should be able to go back to 1850 and find millions of kids killing themselves because it [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1022.4200000000001s)]
*  turns out they were trans and not being affirmed. But child suicide almost like didn't exist [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1027.46s)]
*  up until very recently. It was basically unheard of. So it's just everything they say. It's just, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1032.66s)]
*  when you apply a little bit of common sense, it all starts to break down. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1038.74s)]
*  When do you think this shift, do you think it's the Caitlyn Jenner thing that shifted it? Like [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1042.18s)]
*  when did this become a big part of the cultural narrative? Because I would have never imagined [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1046.9s)]
*  if you came up to me 20 years ago and said in 20 years from now, like gender identity will be one [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1052.98s)]
*  of the big points of contention in our culture among politics. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1059.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think you kind of decide where you want to start because like in the film, we go back to [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1064.66s)]
*  Alfred Money and Alfred Kinsey and John Money, mid 20th century. So these ideas were out there. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1070.42s)]
*  I mean, these are the guys who came up with like the phrase gender identity was invented by [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1076.98s)]
*  Kinsey was a wild dude. Yeah, he was they both they both were they were degenerate pedophiles. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1080.5s)]
*  And it's clear in both the especially Kinsey, it's pretty clear that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1088.1000000000001s)]
*  he had his sexual fetishes and fascinations and he wanted to prove to himself that he's not weird [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1091.94s)]
*  because everyone's like this. And so he goes out and you know, he declares, I think he said that [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1099.3s)]
*  10% of adult males are gay or something like that. And then you find out that he's he's mostly [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1105.06s)]
*  surveying prisoners and sex offenders and you know, people like that. He's not he's not going to just [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1110.42s)]
*  a normal intersection of Americans. So you go back to the film, you go back to the film, you go back [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1114.66s)]
*  So you go back to those guys, but I think [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1121.22s)]
*  what's what's the moment when all this exploded into the mainstream, it kind of it was like [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1125.38s)]
*  seated into our institutions. And then there was a moment when it when it all became mainstream. And [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1128.74s)]
*  I don't know if Bruce Jenner is the definite starting point. But I do think that that was a [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1133.38s)]
*  a pivotal, pivotal moment. It was a pivotal moment, not just because now the media is [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1139.38s)]
*  celebrating this, but also because conservatives, you know, had an opportunity right then and there [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1143.6200000000001s)]
*  to take a stand against this, to recognize it for what it is for the threat that it is, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1150.9s)]
*  and to take a firm stand. And I think so many conservatives didn't because they just imagine [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1155.14s)]
*  that this is either they don't want to get in trouble, we call it transphobe, or they just [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1158.66s)]
*  thought it's sort of a sideshow. And and so they just many conservatives basically ignored it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1162.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't think anybody realized it was going to get this big. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1168.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people didn't. But I mean, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1171.8600000000001s)]
*  it, it should have been it should have been more clear, I guess what it could have should have, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1176.5s)]
*  but it should have been more clear, because this was this was their waging an assault on, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1180.34s)]
*  like, basic, fundamental reality. And so it goes way beyond this is not just about gender, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1185.6999999999998s)]
*  this is about reality. That's why in the film, every conversation I had with someone on that [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1193.6999999999998s)]
*  side of it, every single one devolved into this, well, what is truth and who's truth and how do [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1198.1799999999998s)]
*  you know what truth is? Yeah, you know, so I'm sitting in the same room as someone. And, and, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1203.22s)]
*  but I can't get them to acknowledge that we exist in the same reality, we can share a room, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1208.5800000000002s)]
*  but we don't share a reality. I had there was in the film, there's one woman that we talked to on [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1212.26s)]
*  the street. And she was giving me this, we all have our own truth thing. And then I said, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1218.74s)]
*  Well, what if it's my truth that you don't exist? And she said, Well, then I don't exist. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1223.38s)]
*  She was willing to erase her own existence, if that's how I perceive it. It's totally incoherent. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1228.74s)]
*  I found out about the, the, the reaction that people have to this and how strongly they're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1234.58s)]
*  committed to this when there was a transgender fighter that was hiding the fact found Fox, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1242.1s)]
*  hiding the fact that they were biologically male, and competed twice as a woman beaten the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1249.1399999999999s)]
*  fuck out of these women. And I was like, this is crazy. Like you can't end it in trying to say [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1256.58s)]
*  that it was just a medical procedure. And when I, I thought rightly got angry at it, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1262.02s)]
*  I saw all these articles written, all these pieces about how transphobic my position was, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1268.18s)]
*  and what a horrible person I was like, we're literally talking about someone not telling [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1274.5s)]
*  someone. I said that, look, if you are a transgender athlete, and you tell someone, hey, I was [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1280.5s)]
*  biologically male, but now identify as a female, would you like to fight? And that person still [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1287.6999999999998s)]
*  says yes, all in, go ahead, have fun. Just like I think you should be able to ride bulls and go [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1292.5s)]
*  dirt biking and skydiving, do whatever wild, dangerous shit you want to do. But to hide the [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1299.2199999999998s)]
*  fact that you're biologically male, and you are a male for 30 plus years. That was madness to me. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1304.1799999999998s)]
*  But they had already drawn this line this in and I was I remember arguing with someone on Twitter [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1311.86s)]
*  about it. When this woman said she was always a woman, I go even when this person impregnated [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1316.02s)]
*  a woman and had a child with them. She's like, even then, like even then she stuck her penis [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1322.74s)]
*  in a woman, got her pregnant. That's the science. Became a father. And even that during that act, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1328.98s)]
*  she was a woman. Like what exactly what is a woman? What the fuck are we talking about? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1336.82s)]
*  They what they're really saying is that this person, they're talking about self perception, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1342.42s)]
*  like this person perceived himself that way. But but self perception is not always reality. This [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1347.54s)]
*  is like, of course, we all write in most other contexts, we recognize that a person can have a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1353.46s)]
*  self perception that just is not true. It's just inaccurate. I mean, you could walk down the street [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1357.54s)]
*  in any city and find drug addled homeless people talking to themselves. And if you were to ask them [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1363.7s)]
*  about themselves, you're gonna find they're gonna say a lot of things that just don't line up with [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1368.82s)]
*  reality. And in every other context, we're allowed to acknowledge that even in medical context. I [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1372.26s)]
*  mean, someone who has body dysmorphia in the form of anorexia, you know, a young woman goes to the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1376.6599999999999s)]
*  doctor and she's 90 pounds. And she says, I feel like I'm a 300 pound, you know, fat ass. Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1384.6599999999999s)]
*  The doctor, the doctor is not going to affirm that and say, well, if that's how you feel, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1391.9399999999998s)]
*  that's how you fatness is on a spectrum. I mean, they're not gonna give her diet pills, they're [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1394.82s)]
*  going to. But why gender? Like, why is gender this ideological battleground? Like, how the fuck did [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1398.34s)]
*  that become this thing where it's, it's encouraging, like this cult like mentality, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1405.9399999999998s)]
*  where you can't even if things are clearly odd, clearly don't make any sense. They don't, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1413.3s)]
*  they don't fit with logic or reality. You have to adhere to whatever this ideology is promoted. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1419.86s)]
*  Promoting. I think it's, it's, I mean, I'm open at the most basic level, I think that this is, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1425.54s)]
*  it's a, like I said, it's an attack on truth. And this is, you know, if you want to, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1432.18s)]
*  if your project is kind of is relativism, and you want to get rid of objective ideas of truth, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1439.1399999999999s)]
*  what are you going to go after? I mean, if you can go after someone's really fundamental [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1444.8999999999999s)]
*  understanding of themselves, it's not just that they're attacking reality. It's like they're [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1449.54s)]
*  attacking the reality of the self. And so they're depriving a person of the ability to understand [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1456.34s)]
*  their own themselves. And once you do that, if you're successful on a societal level, then it's [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1460.5s)]
*  sort of like the sky's the limit, you can go anywhere from there. I think. So do you think [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1466.26s)]
*  this is like a conscious decision? Or do you think this is just something that people have adopted, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1471.62s)]
*  because it seems to be the ideology de jure? I think it's, it depends on who you're talking [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1476.34s)]
*  about. I mean, at an institutional level, I think, I think a lot of is conscious. Some of the people [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1482.1s)]
*  that I talked about, talked to in the film, I think that they, they know that this doesn't make [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1486.5s)]
*  any sense and that it's wrong. And I think, because they have to know it, you know, if you're a doctor, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1490.1799999999998s)]
*  you do have a basic understanding of male and female, you must, that you wouldn't have been [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1496.4199999999998s)]
*  able to get through medical school if you don't. So I think that for them, it's intensely ideological. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1499.86s)]
*  It's also, it's also profit driven. They've got, they're making a lot of money off of this. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1504.26s)]
*  You know, if a, if a six year old boy says, I feel like I'm a girl, and the response to the boy is, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1508.42s)]
*  no, you're a boy and that's, that's what you are. And that's okay. And he'll get over it and he'll [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1514.82s)]
*  get over it. It's just a phase and he'll live a normal life. And that's fine. But there's not, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1518.5s)]
*  there's no money in that. Whereas if you encourage the delusion, now that boy individually is worth [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1521.86s)]
*  millions of dollars down the line to therapists and doctors and endocrinologists and surgeons [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1526.98s)]
*  and everything. So I think it's, I think it's profit driven. And then there, and then there's [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1533.3s)]
*  also just a lot of actual confusion out there. People don't really understand what's going on. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1536.82s)]
*  And then there's cowardice too. People are, are just terrified. You know, we, I've certainly seen [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1540.6599999999999s)]
*  a lot of that. People just are, they are scared shitless about being accused of bigotry, losing [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1544.6599999999999s)]
*  their social media platforms, losing their jobs, losing their friends. I get this question all the [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1553.7s)]
*  time, everywhere I go. Well, how do I deal with this at my job? Because if I reveal that I [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1557.1399999999999s)]
*  understand reality at my job, I'll lose my job or I'll lose my family. You know, it's, this is what [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1562.58s)]
*  people are dealing with. And it is what people are dealing with. That really is what's happening, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1567.1399999999999s)]
*  which is one of the more confusing aspects of this is that there's no logical discussion about [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1572.6599999999999s)]
*  this. It's just, you are either on the good side or you're a bigot and that's the binary. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1578.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And that's because they, they know that they can't, the people that are pushing this stuff [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1585.22s)]
*  know that they can't defend it. They can't defend it intellectually. They also feel like they [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1590.18s)]
*  shouldn't have to. I think that they, some of the people we talked to, what is a woman, it's, they [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1595.3s)]
*  were, they were offended that we were even questioning them because from their perspective, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1600.74s)]
*  especially if you're a college professor or something, the relationship is supposed to be, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1604.3400000000001s)]
*  I pontificate and you just sit there slack jawed and nod your head and go along with it. So they [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1608.1000000000001s)]
*  feel like they shouldn't have to defend it, but they also know that they can't. And so [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1613.14s)]
*  what are you left with? You're left with speech suppression, scaring people. That's the only tool [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1616.5s)]
*  in your bag. And it's been really effective, unfortunately, so far. What is the response to [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1622.82s)]
*  your film been? What's it been like? Was anything surprising? I guess I would say I was surprised [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1628.42s)]
*  by the, by just how, by just how big the response was. I knew we had something. I knew it was, I knew [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1636.1000000000001s)]
*  we had something with the idea. And then once we filmed all the footage, before we even put it [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1644.02s)]
*  together, I'm like, I know we have something explosive here, but you never know exactly [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1647.62s)]
*  how people will respond to something. It's the first time I've been involved in a film myself. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1652.1s)]
*  So I was, I was expecting a big reaction, but not quite to the extent that we got. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1655.1399999999999s)]
*  And across the spectrum too, because I knew that our audience at the Daily Wire [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1661.78s)]
*  would love the film and appreciate it, but it's gone way beyond that. I mean, I hear from people [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1666.02s)]
*  who tell me that they're, they identify as liberal or they're independent, they're not [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1670.58s)]
*  ideological. They saw the film, they tell everyone to watch it. You know, I hear that all the time [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1673.9399999999998s)]
*  from people. Well, that's where I got it from. I got it from a liberal mother. She was one of the [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1678.02s)]
*  first people to tell me about it. And she's concerned about it because she sees children [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1682.58s)]
*  in her kid's school that are identifying in this way. And she has this fear that it's a social [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1686.8999999999999s)]
*  contagion, but she also feels the suppression of that idea. Like that other parents, if she brings [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1693.06s)]
*  it up with them, they're either dismissive or they don't want to talk about it. And she's like, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1698.58s)]
*  Jesus Christ, it feels like, like people are under a spell. Yeah, it does feel like that. It's like [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1702.5s)]
*  invasion of the body snatchers or something. Exactly. It does. And the other thing that I [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1707.86s)]
*  hear from people about the movie, probably the number one piece of feedback I get is that they [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1711.6999999999998s)]
*  just didn't realize it was this, they didn't realize how bad it was or how pervasive it was. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1719.54s)]
*  I think a lot, even people that I thought were sort of politically engaged on the right, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1724.42s)]
*  I hear the same thing. It's like, I didn't know that it was this bad. I didn't know that it was, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1729.14s)]
*  that it had gone to this extent. Well, when Jordan Peterson first started talking about [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1732.98s)]
*  compelled speech and compelled use of pronouns, I remember people thinking like, why do you care [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1737.3s)]
*  about this? This is like such a small issue with a marginalized group of people, like let them [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1744.02s)]
*  have their identity and use the pronouns they want. And this is like, what was it, 2015, 2016. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1749.46s)]
*  And I remember his warning and I remember many other people like, this is going to spill over. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1757.54s)]
*  If you can enforce this on a professor, and if you can enforce compelled speech, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1764.42s)]
*  because Canada doesn't have the same free speech laws we do in America. And if you can, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1768.82s)]
*  where does it go? How are you compelling it? Well, it means through violence or through police [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1773.38s)]
*  or through the fear of being arrested, the fear of having your job taken away from you. Like this [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1778.82s)]
*  is literally what happens when you use laws to compel people. Like you have to have some sort of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1784.74s)]
*  a punishment if they don't follow through, if they don't follow your orders. And this is what he was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1790.8999999999999s)]
*  worrying about. And I remember at the time being like, I hope he's wrong. Like I hope it doesn't [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1796.26s)]
*  get that big. But now here we are, seven years later, and he was right. Because there's also [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1801.06s)]
*  a difference between telling people they can't say something, which is what free speech suppression [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1808.18s)]
*  usually is. And that's bad enough. But then telling people that they have to say something, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1813.3s)]
*  compelling them to actually say something, putting words in their mouth and telling them [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1819.54s)]
*  you have to say this. And it's not just, it's not, it's not, pronouns, it's not a small thing, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1822.5s)]
*  because when you use the she for a he, you're not only being forced to say something, but you're [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1827.54s)]
*  being forced to affirm an acquiesce to a claim that you don't agree with. You're being forced to [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1833.54s)]
*  express a belief that's not yours. I mean, it's like, it's not much different from, you know, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1841.78s)]
*  a dictatorship forcing someone to profess belief in a religion, you know, for it's like, it's forced [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1848.26s)]
*  conversion, basically, is what it is. And, and once you allow that, it doesn't matter. Of course, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1853.78s)]
*  it's going to start somewhere small, it's just pronouns. It always starts that way. But, but like [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1859.38s)]
*  I said, it's also, it's actually not small pronouns are, there's a reason why the left makes a big deal [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1863.7800000000002s)]
*  out of it. So anytime people on the right say, well, it's not a big deal. In response to the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1868.5800000000002s)]
*  left making a big deal about something, well, they wouldn't be making a big deal about it if [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1873.46s)]
*  it wasn't a big deal. And the fact that they that they're choosing this hill to defend should tell [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1876.18s)]
*  you that there's something here worth fighting over. My kid was going to school with a girl who [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1881.5400000000002s)]
*  was a they them, she decided she was a they them. And she demanded that they talk in they them way. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1886.34s)]
*  Like you had to use when you were referring to her as a plural girl wore makeup, dressed like a girl [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1894.1s)]
*  just decided that she was a they them and would get angry if you misgendered her and not calling [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1901.3s)]
*  her her a plural. Yeah. And what does that? What does that mean? So we have enough of a problem [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1908.74s)]
*  getting someone who identifies as a woman to tell us what a woman is. But what's a they? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1914.5s)]
*  Yeah. What do you, what do you describe to me the feelings of being a they describe, you know, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1917.62s)]
*  can you describe that? What does that, what does that experience like? And, and anytime you ask [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1921.86s)]
*  someone to do that, it immediately descends into, into incoherence. And also by the way, the actual [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1927.06s)]
*  gender neutral pronoun for an individual is it it's not they. So it's interesting that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1933.54s)]
*  when nobody wants to be an it because it's dehumanizing, right? Yeah. They want to be a [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1938.34s)]
*  they. But yeah, you have, if you're calling yourself non-binary, you have dehumanized yourself [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1942.1s)]
*  because human beings exist in a, in a sex binary male and female. If you're rejecting that, you [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1946.6599999999999s)]
*  are rejecting your human identity. And so you've already dehumanized yourself. You are actually [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1951.3799999999999s)]
*  it. If it's true that you are not a male or female, then you are it. We don't know what else to call [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1956.02s)]
*  you. And then maybe more importantly, when one of the things that you're doing when you're doing that [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1959.78s)]
*  is you're giving people, especially if you do it to young people, you're giving them an opportunity [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1965.1399999999999s)]
*  to be special and to get special treatment without any special act. They haven't done anything that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1969.86s)]
*  warrants that unique behavior. Yeah, I think that's a really important point. I think I think that's [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1975.7s)]
*  actually so much of this that people don't notice it. But a lot of this is is just it's just standard [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1982.58s)]
*  narcissism. Yes. Especially you listen to these, you know, why is this so common among celebrities [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1988.5s)]
*  now? All the celebrities have trans kids and they're coming out as non-binary and whatever else. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1992.42s)]
*  And then you listen to like Demi Lovato, whoever, and you listen to them explain why they're they [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=1997.3s)]
*  them. It's always, well, I just I just I don't identify with these labels. I'm beyond that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2002.26s)]
*  I'm above that. It's like these labels were good enough for billions of humans before you, but it's [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2007.54s)]
*  not good enough for you. You can't find yourself there. But but all these other billions of human [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2013.3799999999999s)]
*  beings, it was fine. They had no problem. But you're so special that we need to change the rules of [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2018.5s)]
*  the English language for you specifically. It's incredibly egotistical. It's bizarre. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2023.78s)]
*  It's like if you feel that you're different than everyone else, you're still a female. You're just [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2030.58s)]
*  a different human being who happens to be a female. If you're so unique, go prove it with your actions, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2037.3799999999999s)]
*  prove it with your work, prove it out there in the world. But to demand this very special attention. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2042.74s)]
*  And that's what we give people. Like if you give people that thing today, they'll tell that there's [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2049.7000000000003s)]
*  groups of people that will tell you you're amazing, you're incredible, you're beautiful, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2056.02s)]
*  you're brave. It gives them positive affirmation for making these decisions. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2059.2200000000003s)]
*  It's also it's also part of what you're describing is personality, right? I mean, so if you're saying [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2064.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm a I'm a female, but I don't identify with girly things, and I don't like the color pink [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2070.7400000000002s)]
*  and whatever, okay, that's your personality. And it's fine. There are many ways to be a woman. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2076.5s)]
*  There are many ways to be a man. There's like almost infinite ways of doing it, because each [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2082.34s)]
*  man and woman has their own personality, their own perspective of the world. And that's fine. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2087.38s)]
*  So I think that what I'm expressing is more the kind of traditional ideas much more expansive, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2090.82s)]
*  because it allows you as a man to just, you know, be who you are, you're still a man, but be who you [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2097.14s)]
*  are. The idea now is that if you're well, if you're a man, but you you have interests or ideas that [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2103.62s)]
*  fall outside of the standard norm, now you lose your manhood, you're actually a woman. So they're [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2109.54s)]
*  actually reinforcing the gender binary while while trying to destroy it at the same time, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2113.38s)]
*  which is interesting. But I think most of what they're trying to describe is actually just [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2117.94s)]
*  personality. And now we have this situation where, you know, you can have a person who has five [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2122.18s)]
*  different genders and six sexual orientations, but no personality, because their personality has been [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2126.66s)]
*  subsumed by all of these labels, they've categorized and labeled and everything. And [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2132.98s)]
*  it's, it's really strange. The art exhibit recently where the girls threw soup on the [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2137.54s)]
*  Van Gogh. You know about that story? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. They asked someone was interviewing [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2142.9s)]
*  them. Oh, Patrick bet David was interviewing them and asked them, Can I ask what your pronouns are? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2147.78s)]
*  And she said she was he she they, he she and they, I always say masculine, you're feminine, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2153.62s)]
*  and you're plural. She's all of them. She's everything. She's basically like a Hindu God. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2160.66s)]
*  It's like, like, what are you? This is just laziness, at least choose one. It's just pompous [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2165.54s)]
*  nonsense. It's just in that particular case, thinking that you're going to fucking cure [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2171.8599999999997s)]
*  climate change by throwing soup on a priceless painting, and then gluing yourself to a wall. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2177.22s)]
*  And also, what does it tell you that the person interviewing her knew that she definitely has [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2183.7799999999997s)]
*  different pronouns? Yeah, you just you just know, it comes with the with the package, which tells [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2189.22s)]
*  you again, that this is an ideological and political thing. It's not an actual identity. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2194.02s)]
*  If you were one of those people that thought that there was a literal attack on the foundations of [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2198.2599999999998s)]
*  this country to try to destroy it from the youth up. What better way to do it than with social media [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2204.1s)]
*  reinforcing all this stuff? I mean, how many? How many tik tok videos have you seen like libs of [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2212.58s)]
*  tik tok is a fucking insane account? And so many people get so angry at that account. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2217.7s)]
*  She's not creating anything. She's curating. So she's finding all these videos that absolutely exist. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2223.2999999999997s)]
*  And you're angry that someone puts these videos that actually exist of people actually saying [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2230.66s)]
*  insane things about recruiting kids and about, you know, teaching kids things in class that makes [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2237.14s)]
*  parents upset about gender and that all your kids are going to be trans and all all these videos [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2244.9s)]
*  that she's posted. And people are furious calling it this hard right, you know, far right account of [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2250.58s)]
*  hate mongering account. Like it's a curated account. They're just she's just finding insane shit [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2256.9s)]
*  that kids are actually being exposed to in mass and bringing it to people that may not be aware of it. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2263.7000000000003s)]
*  Which is journalism. That's why I really think libs of tik tok is one of the most important [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2271.7s)]
*  journalists in America. One of the only ones because there's not there aren't many journalists [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2275.2999999999997s)]
*  out there that are actually doing their job of finding things people don't know about and [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2279.3799999999997s)]
*  alerting them to it because that's what you're supposed to do. But I think a lot of it is, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2282.4199999999996s)]
*  is yeah, these are things that people post on their own. Also, when she posts [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2286.4199999999996s)]
*  stuff from a, you know, children's hospital saying that these are the these are the [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2292.4199999999996s)]
*  procedures we perform on kids, they're just reposting what the hospital said themselves. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2295.46s)]
*  But the point is that it's they don't want us to see it. So the Children's Hospital, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2300.18s)]
*  they've got it on their website. And they want only the people who have already bought it because [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2305.7s)]
*  if you're going to a Children's Hospital website to look up gender affirmation care, quote unquote, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2309.62s)]
*  then most of the time you've already bought in and so they want you to see that. Tik Tok, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2314.66s)]
*  they look at that as like it's all the young progressive people. And they're okay with them [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2318.74s)]
*  saying it, but they don't want us outside of those bubbles to see these things. Yeah. And the idea is [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2322.8199999999997s)]
*  against it is that it's misrepresenting that she's unfairly highlighting these [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2328.66s)]
*  radical people that are not the norm. Like says who says who these are just all you're doing is [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2335.46s)]
*  looking at real videos. Like if you look at Project Veritas, and you catch Twitter employees [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2342.74s)]
*  talking about how they silence conservatives, and they have like some hidden camera, the argument, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2348.3399999999997s)]
*  oh, they caught those people off camera. Like, how do you fucking know? Are you talking to them? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2352.8999999999996s)]
*  Like this is our only window into this. Yeah, like to deny that you get a chance to see a [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2356.98s)]
*  doctor saying, we'll get a kid in at 16. It's okay. Well, I thought you only do it at 18. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2362.66s)]
*  Now we'll do 16. Like they've said that before, like, so we will accept minors for surgery. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2368.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's when we in Nashville, we got Vanderbilt Hospital, and they were doing this [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2373.78s)]
*  stuff to kids too. And I did my own Libs and Tik Tok routine where I put on Twitter, I had this whole [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2381.3s)]
*  thread outlining what Vanderbilt, all the services they provide. And I was accused of the same thing, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2386.82s)]
*  are you taking out a contact? So this is misinformation. It's like, I'm documented. This [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2394.1800000000003s)]
*  is what they said. This is on their website. I have the document. I have the videos. And they said all [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2399.1400000000003s)]
*  that. But then the interesting thing is that after we reported on it, and it was this big deal, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2403.3s)]
*  Vanderbilt Hospital after a couple of weeks sent a letter to our state legislators saying that [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2408.98s)]
*  they're going to put a pause on gender affirmation surgery for minors. Well, if you're pausing it, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2412.9s)]
*  I thought it wasn't happening. Because if you're pausing it, it means that it was happening. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  Because of course it is happening, especially another thing that they do to kind of obfuscate [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2422.42s)]
*  is they say, well, genital surgeries are not happening to minors. And even that isn't true [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2428.1s)]
*  because that is happening. But that is more rare. What is much more common are double mastectomies [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2433.38s)]
*  on minors. And that is very common. And that's happening in almost every state in the country [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2439.7s)]
*  at exponentially increasing rates. You're taking the body parts away from girls without them [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2444.18s)]
*  understanding, again, what they're actually giving up or what the consequences will be in the future. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2454.3399999999997s)]
*  And especially knowing what we know about the human mind and the development of the human mind, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2459.3799999999997s)]
*  your frontal lobes not even fully formed until you're in your 20s. Give these people this, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2464.66s)]
*  even to give them the option to change your life forever irrevocably. You're going to give them [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2471.54s)]
*  a surgery. You're going to allow them to have a surgery or force them to have a surgery, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2480.2599999999998s)]
*  encourage them to have a surgery. That's going to change their life forever. You don't allow them [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2484.2599999999998s)]
*  to do that with anything. You can't even get fucking tattooed. You can't get tattooed until [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2488.66s)]
*  you're 18. Yeah. When I was growing up, I remember the job of adults was always to [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2492.34s)]
*  stop us from doing all the incredibly stupid things we always wanted to do. Especially as [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2498.26s)]
*  you become a teenager, you're hormonal, you're impulsive. And so the jobs of an adult is to be [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2502.34s)]
*  the guiding force to provide insight, to be a source of maturity. But they've just abdicated [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2510.02s)]
*  that completely. Dwayne Wade has a quote unquote trans kid, the NBA player. And now his ex-wife [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2518.42s)]
*  has come out and said that she thinks that he is encouraging this and has imposed it on his son [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2528.26s)]
*  so he can profit off of it, which seems like a fair theory to me. But anyway, there was an interview [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2534.7400000000002s)]
*  he did where he was on a red carpet somewhere and he was being praised by the journalists. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2539.78s)]
*  I said, oh, you're so great. Do you have advice for parents out there? And he said that, yeah, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2544.2599999999998s)]
*  your job as a parent is to sit back and see where your kids want to go and go there with them. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2549.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm thinking, I mean, I have four kids. And if I adopted that strategy as a parent, all of my kids [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2556.18s)]
*  would be dead by the time they're two years old. Like sit back and see where they want to go and [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2561.62s)]
*  just go with them. That's like the opposite of your job as a parent. Your job as a parent is to be, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2565.22s)]
*  you can listen to what they want, but then you have their desires and their opinions and you're [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2571.78s)]
*  filtering it through your own understanding, your much superior understanding of reality, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2577.7s)]
*  and then you decide what makes sense for them to do. Yeah, that's a ridiculous notion that you're [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2581.94s)]
*  just supposed to sit back and watch. You're supposed to have wisdom. You're supposed to have [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2587.86s)]
*  a life lived longer and more knowledge, more information, and you do your very best to help [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2592.1s)]
*  them develop and find their own way through life while protecting them from dangers and from things [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2598.42s)]
*  that they don't understand yet. And protecting them from themselves. Yes. Yes. And this notion [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2603.94s)]
*  that this is the one time where we're supposed to abandon all these principles when it comes to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2610.82s)]
*  gender, that's what's so confusing. There's a political push for this that comes from the left. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2615.3s)]
*  One of the things that I found when I was going over that prisoner case was that the whole thing [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2624.9s)]
*  about it where they made it optional, it was, I'm trying to find this fucking article. I know I [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2633.22s)]
*  saved it, but the story about it was that it was something that George Soros was involved with. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2643.14s)]
*  That would surprise me. Yeah. I'm gonna find it here. So that person has a website, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2651.22s)]
*  and you can go to the website and it's like Justice for Demi. They call themselves Demi now. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2659.22s)]
*  And again, this is the person that stabbed their foster father 27 times at age 16, and then afterwards [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2663.62s)]
*  got arrested and said that they were female. But that it was a part of a program that was like a [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2673.8599999999997s)]
*  gender self ID. That was the program behind it. Yeah. Gender self ID policy by George Soros Open [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2679.94s)]
*  Society Foundations. So they're the ones who pushed this through in New Jersey. So gender [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2691.62s)]
*  self ID is like a policy that they instituted for prisoners, that they had done that in New Jersey [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2696.7400000000002s)]
*  just a year before that. And so this was just like, what are you? I'm a boy. Okay. You get to go to [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2703.06s)]
*  the boys present. If you're a girl, what are you? I'm a girl. You get to go to the girls prison if [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2709.62s)]
*  you're a boy. All you have to do is just say it. Which is fucking madness when you're talking about [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2714.9s)]
*  someone who got arrested for fraud, has a fake Rolex, three criminal alias. He would never lie. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2721.46s)]
*  This is like a literal liar and a murderer. And you're like, well, he wouldn't lie about gender. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2726.9s)]
*  There's no way someone's scamming the system. Well, they really have no choice but to [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2732.8199999999997s)]
*  institute policies like this. This is the corner they painted themselves into. Because if they [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2738.7400000000002s)]
*  suggest that you have to offer any proof at all, then that is to acknowledge that there's some [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2743.94s)]
*  sort of reality outside of the individual whim. Even to say that, well, there has to be a letter [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2751.7000000000003s)]
*  from, because this used to be the thing, you got to get a letter from two mental health providers [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2759.14s)]
*  who will affirm that this is true about you. Well, they don't even want that because then [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2763.54s)]
*  why does that person get to say? Only I, I'm the only one that gets to determine my own biological [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2768.18s)]
*  identity. And you end up with policies like that. And not surprising that George Soros is behind it. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2773.06s)]
*  Well, Oregon is one of the weirder ones because Oregon will allow places to prescribe testosterone [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2778.1s)]
*  to young girls when they're as young as 15 years old without consent from the parents at all. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2784.42s)]
*  There's not another thing that you can get at 15 that's going to change your life like that. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2789.54s)]
*  Yeah. And that might change because they are, you know, they are changing the ideas of consent [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2795.3s)]
*  that we've all agreed to. We all understand. We all understand that children cannot consent. Even [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2805.46s)]
*  if they say yes to something, not really consenting because they don't understand what they're doing. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2811.6200000000003s)]
*  They don't have a fully formed brain. Especially taking hormones that aren't natural to your body [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2816.1800000000003s)]
*  at 15 years old. And you're sterilizing the kid. They're not going to be able to have kids in the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2822.18s)]
*  future. And you can say all you want. Well, we told them that and they were okay with it. At 15, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2827.06s)]
*  they were okay with it. I mean, you know, I had started having kids when I was 26. If you had [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2832.3399999999997s)]
*  asked me when I was 24, I would have said, no, I don't want any kids. You know, because even when [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2836.98s)]
*  I was 24, I couldn't imagine having a kid. I couldn't imagine wanting a kid. Now I have four [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2840.98s)]
*  kids. I can't imagine not having kids. But that's, those are the changes that happen even in your [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2845.2999999999997s)]
*  mid-20s. People go through changes like that. So the idea that a 15 year old can just resign from [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2848.98s)]
*  childbearing and that's supposed to be a meaningful choice, like they know what they're doing, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2855.7s)]
*  it's total madness. Now, have you received offers to debate people that have differing opinions on [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2860.58s)]
*  this? Oh, no. No, no, no. I would love to. I've challenged, I've put the challenge out there. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2867.78s)]
*  I go around to college campuses. We're on a college campus store right now screening the film. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2874.1s)]
*  And everywhere I go, of course, there's protests and everything, but it's a YAFT tour and Young [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2878.42s)]
*  America's for Freedom. And the policy there is if you're in the room for the lecture, we get to the [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2884.34s)]
*  Q&A portion. If you disagree, you move right to the front of the line. And, but no one, they'll [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2889.86s)]
*  stand outside with signs and they'll scream. And one of the most recent ones I was at, they were [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2895.38s)]
*  tearing pages out of a Bible and eating them. So that's, so they'll eat, they will eat the Bible, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2900.58s)]
*  but they won't come in and like, isn't that in the Bible? That might be in the Bible. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2905.54s)]
*  I don't know. It's just maybe the side of the apocalypse. People are eating the Bible. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2912.2599999999998s)]
*  I might have a kind of an exorcist, like an exorcism type of thing. I don't know. We'll see. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2916.18s)]
*  What the fuck? Yeah, but they, no, they don't, they don't want to, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2919.46s)]
*  they only want to talk to you if you're a conservative, if they think they can roll you. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2924.9s)]
*  Like that's the, these are the conservatives that are allowed to go on CNN and all the rest of it. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2929.3s)]
*  They think that they believe that you're going to play the patsy, but if you make it clear that [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2932.42s)]
*  you're not going to play that role, then they have no interest. Did you see that John Stewart, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2936.66s)]
*  very confrontational interview that he had with that woman who was bizarre? Yeah. The whole, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2940.34s)]
*  the whole episode was just, was frustrating to watch because it was total nonsense. He was [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2946.9s)]
*  burning down a whole bunch of straw men with that episode. And John Oliver did the same thing. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2954.26s)]
*  Yes. And the woman that he was, that was the attorney general of, I forget, Arkansas, I think. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2957.94s)]
*  Yeah. And yeah, he, you know, it's, it's not everyone, what she is doing to protect kids [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2964.02s)]
*  is, is great. I mean, she's a great American for doing that. And she has a lot of political courage, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2973.3s)]
*  but not everyone is equipped to sit in a room with the cameras going and, you know, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2976.98s)]
*  defend their position in that kind of environment. And so she got kind of, she did get a little bit [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2983.6200000000003s)]
*  rolled during that conversation, which is unfortunate. I would love to sit down and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2987.46s)]
*  talk to him, but he's not a talk so he'll be like me. Well, why these, that's the point. Like that [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2990.58s)]
*  would be a real conversation and the way he did it with the straw men and the way he was talking [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2995.46s)]
*  about his affirming their healthcare and affirming their gender and his, his whole thing with her was [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=2999.86s)]
*  just about the medical consensus. And he kept saying, well, all these, all these doctors say [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3005.7s)]
*  that we should be transitioning kids. So who are you to say, say otherwise? The mistake that she made [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3010.1s)]
*  was to play that game. And then she said, well, but there are other doctors who say that it's not [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3014.58s)]
*  okay. And so now you're playing this credentialism game. Right. And once you do that, first of all, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3018.34s)]
*  you're going to lose because it is true that the medical industry has largely bought into this. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3024.74s)]
*  And so you're going to lose that, that contest. But what you should be pointing out is that first of [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3029.94s)]
*  all, the people that you're appealing to as authorities are all the people who, who are making [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3035.62s)]
*  a lot of money off of this. So the only people we should trust about the questions of gender [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3041.22s)]
*  affirmation are the ones who have a financial stake in it. That doesn't make any sense to me. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3045.3799999999997s)]
*  And then, and then also, I don't care who, I don't care how many, what letters they have [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3051.8599999999997s)]
*  next to their name. I don't care if they went to med medical school. If they're making claims, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3054.5s)]
*  we can assess those claims on their merits. We don't have to be credentialed to do that. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3059.14s)]
*  And I, and I can say that what these doctors are saying is it just doesn't make any sense. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3063.8599999999997s)]
*  But it is bizarre that so many are saying it. It is bizarre that so many in the community [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3068.42s)]
*  that we have always assumed is protecting the best interests of personal health and, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3074.9s)]
*  and wellness, that these are the people that are saying it so often. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3081.38s)]
*  Well, there's the money. I think the money part scares the shit out of me. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3087.54s)]
*  Because I don't want to think that that's real. I mean, I want to hold out hope for [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3091.62s)]
*  the better aspects of human nature that people wouldn't do that and think of children and being [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3098.02s)]
*  able to diffuse responsibility and say, well, this is bigger than me and I'm just part of this. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3104.2599999999998s)]
*  And this is what we're doing now. And yeah, you would hope a person individually wouldn't do that. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3109.06s)]
*  But, but, but people definitely will do that. I mean, acting as a group, you know, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3114.02s)]
*  and when you've got the, when you've got the twin pressures of, well, you've got twin incentives of [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3118.66s)]
*  the political ideological incentives and the monetary incentive, that's, that's very powerful. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3123.78s)]
*  And I think that does explain it. I mean, there, there are, you know, there are like child [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3127.86s)]
*  endocrinology clinics barely exist anymore because they've all become transgender. They've, they've [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3133.94s)]
*  all that's, this is what they do now. There, there are a lot of, there are a lot of people, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3140.02s)]
*  doctors who got into the medical field and they did a certain thing and then the transgender [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3144.34s)]
*  stuff came along and that's, and that's their whole, that's what they do. Well, same for a [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3148.5800000000004s)]
*  lot of plastic surgeons that this is, this is basically their whole business now is doing the [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3151.86s)]
*  gender surgeries. And so you see the incentive for them. I mean, they've, they've, they have [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3155.86s)]
*  staked everything on this. They've also staked their professional reputation because that's the [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3160.26s)]
*  other problem. Not only is it the political incentive and the money, but if they admit that [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3164.6600000000003s)]
*  they're wrong, then they're also admitting that they have horribly disfigured and abused [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3168.26s)]
*  thousands, maybe millions of kids. How many people have had this done? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3175.3s)]
*  It depends on what, I don't think we have exact numbers, but it's, if we're talking about the [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3179.46s)]
*  drugs, it's, I mean, millions. You're talking about hormone blockers. Yeah. Millions of kids [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3183.22s)]
*  have been on hormone blockers. Really? I'm sure someone's going to fact check me on that, but my, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3189.94s)]
*  my guess is that we're in, we're into the millions now at this point. Yeah, that'd be my guess. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3195.94s)]
*  I can say for double mastectomies, the most recent, I read a report recently that [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3201.86s)]
*  there were over a thousand done between 2016 and 2019. And when you compare that to how many were [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3208.02s)]
*  done between, you know, 2008 and 2015, it's just, it's a massive increase and a, a, over a thousand [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3213.94s)]
*  girls at double must gender affirming, double mastectomies in that, in that timeframe. And when [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3221.7799999999997s)]
*  you say girls, you're talking about prepubescent? Right. Minors. And that's just up until 2019. And [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3225.94s)]
*  then we know that there's been this exponential increase with all this stuff year over year. So [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3231.7s)]
*  it's, it's a lot, it's too many, you know, one having this happen to one kid is way too many. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3236.58s)]
*  It's a lot more than one. Yeah. And look, if you're an adult and you want to do that and you [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3241.14s)]
*  understand who you are and what you are, and this is how you feel you should progress, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3245.46s)]
*  you're an adult. This is a free country. You should be able to do whatever you want. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3250.58s)]
*  But when you're talking about doing that to children, the fact that so many people are on [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3254.42s)]
*  board and so many people are angry, if you have like people are going to be angry at us that we're [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3257.2999999999997s)]
*  having these conversations. Yeah, they will be. And I also, I actually think that, that this [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3262.82s)]
*  shouldn't, this shouldn't be happening to. It's a very small number if that's right. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3271.3s)]
*  It says over the last five years, there were at least 4,780 adolescents who started puberty [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3276.9s)]
*  blockers and had a prior gender dysphoria diagnosis. This says it's kind of undercounted, but that's, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3281.94s)]
*  that would be a big undercounting. Less than a thousand people a year. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3288.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would guess, you know, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3291.3s)]
*  hundreds of thousands at this, but I could be wrong. Million sounds great. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3296.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. I could be wrong. Yeah. The media matters will have a fun with that clip. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3301.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Matt Walsh claims it was, but part of the problem though is that we don't, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3305.46s)]
*  it's very hard to get numbers on any of this stuff. And, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3311.0600000000004s)]
*  and who, you know, who are you going to trust when they're telling you the numbers? So that's, [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3314.5s)]
*  that's one of the issues with, with, with all this stuff. Does this have to be reported? Is [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3319.78s)]
*  there a database where they're looking at like long-term like results of how this works out in [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3323.38s)]
*  terms of, I mean, are they studying this now in terms of following these kids? Cause if we don't [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3329.94s)]
*  have long-term data on what happens when you give young children, puberty blockers or double [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3334.9s)]
*  mastectomies, I mean, are there at least following up on these kids so we can have long-term data in [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3341.14s)]
*  the future? I think each, each clinic has their own policy. I've asked this question of, of, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3346.42s)]
*  I've asked this question of some of the, you know, some of the D transitioners who went through this [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3351.7s)]
*  and then D trans and what was the follow-up process like? And I've heard different, I've [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3355.94s)]
*  heard different things, but it's not, it's not extensive. Like I haven't heard that they're [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3360.74s)]
*  following up five years later just to see how you're doing kind of thing. I have, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3365.14s)]
*  I certainly haven't heard that. And the one thing that I always hear is that, is that if they have [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3368.74s)]
*  complications, it's very difficult for them to get those complications addressed because the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3375.4599999999996s)]
*  doctors that did this to them aren't interested in dealing with it. And then there are other [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3380.9799999999996s)]
*  doctors too who don't, who don't know how to deal with some of this stuff. So what kind of complications [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3383.9399999999996s)]
*  are they experiencing? Well, it depends on what we're talking about. I mean, you know, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3388.8999999999996s)]
*  if we're talking about genital surgeries, the complications are just, are endless. I mean, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3392.8999999999996s)]
*  you're trying to create a false genitals on someone. It's just, it's, it is a, in fact, [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3397.46s)]
*  one of the, we talked to Marcy Bowers, who's a sex change surgeon in the film. And he said, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3406.9s)]
*  I think he said it's a Faustian bargain. Like he even admitted that this stuff, he said, it's more, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3413.54s)]
*  it's more sophisticated now than it was, but there are a lot of complications. And all this [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3417.46s)]
*  stuff is experimental. It's not like you have centuries of, you know, data to fall back on here. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3422.42s)]
*  Yeah. And another thing that's interesting, as I've been paying attention to this is the, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3428.42s)]
*  the experience of the D-transitioners when they go public with it, the amount of hate they [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3433.54s)]
*  experience and that they get attacked. It's like you're talking about someone who should be an [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3439.2200000000003s)]
*  example, a cautionary tale of like, Hey, this doesn't always work out well. Let's look at this [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3446.26s)]
*  and get an accurate. If you were looking at this in good faith, that you would say, look, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3451.94s)]
*  let's look at this and get an accurate assessment of like, what's the worst case scenario? What [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3456.02s)]
*  happens to some people? But that's not what's happening. They're getting attacked. I mean, [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3460.18s)]
*  it's, I've paid attention to some of it, particularly some of these girls that transitioned [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3465.06s)]
*  to boys and then tried to go back to being a girl again. It's horrific. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3470.7400000000002s)]
*  we had, we did a rally on this a couple, a couple of weeks ago in Nashville against child mutilation. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3475.54s)]
*  And we had a, a D-transitioner named Chloe Cole who came in and spoke. She's 18 years old. And [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3481.3s)]
*  she got double mastectomy when she was, I believe 16. And she's up, she spoke at our rally and she's [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3488.26s)]
*  up on, on the, you know, at the microphone telling her story. And that's all she was doing was trying [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3495.2200000000003s)]
*  it was, she was there to tell her story. I wanted her there to tell her story. And she's getting [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3500.1000000000004s)]
*  screamed at by counter protesters in the crowd saying, F you fascist to an 18 fascist. Yeah. F [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3503.6200000000003s)]
*  you fascist to an 18 year old girl who is a victim of, of, of, you know, medical negligence [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3509.06s)]
*  and worse. But this, this is the, this is the response that they get because you're, you're, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3515.7s)]
*  you know, they also see it's like, you're a traitor to the community or whatever. So they, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3520.66s)]
*  they get what someone like, you know, they'll get what I get, which is just, you're speaking out [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3525.54s)]
*  against this and we hate you, but then it's ramped up even more because there's this element of [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3529.86s)]
*  perceived betrayal. What a bizarre definition of fascism. Call her a fascist because she's talking [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3534.9s)]
*  about medical malpractice and getting her breast removed when she was 16 years old before she knew [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3541.7s)]
*  what the fuck was going on. Talking about this horrible experience that she's had and you decide [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3545.7799999999997s)]
*  that that makes you a fascist. Yeah. I mean, fascism, the word is way overused, but if it, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3551.54s)]
*  if it means anything, I would think using intimidation tactics to stop someone from speaking. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3555.46s)]
*  If fascism means anything these days, then that certainly has to qualify. So I would call that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3561.86s)]
*  fascism. Maybe you're literally in this case, it was like, you're in the crowd trying to drown out [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3566.58s)]
*  her voice by, by screaming at her. I don't, I don't use the fascism label because I think it's silly [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3571.3s)]
*  Hoffman's use, but I would, if we're to call, if we're to call something fascist, I would call [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3577.78s)]
*  that a fascist response. It's certainly more fascist than her. It's, it's bizarre to me that [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3580.6600000000003s)]
*  no one is standing up to try to counter your claims and wanting to go public and wanting to [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3587.62s)]
*  have some sort of a public debate. Cause I would imagine that something that's so ideologically [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3594.58s)]
*  rigid in people's minds, that someone would at least have the ego to step up and say, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3600.98s)]
*  I can counter these arguments and I could be the person to publicly shame this person and, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3608.3399999999997s)]
*  and have a debate with them and trounce them with facts and reality and opinions and [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3612.98s)]
*  describe the shared experiences of these people that have gone through this and it's [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3618.5s)]
*  greatly enhanced their lives, but no one's doing that. Yeah. I mean, there have been, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3621.86s)]
*  right. They, they might post something on Twitter or they'll, they'll say something in their own [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3626.98s)]
*  bubble, but to me directly, they're not going to do it. I mean, even, even just getting media outlets [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3630.58s)]
*  to review the film. I thought put this film out, I knew it was going to be panned in corporate media, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3637.22s)]
*  but I figured, well, no, because they just, they just ignored it. You know, they just pretended to [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3643.7s)]
*  exist. I mean, if you go to Rotten Tomatoes right now, I think we have something like, I don't know, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3648.5s)]
*  five reviews or something. We've got thousands and thousands of, of audience reviews, but we've got, [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3651.22s)]
*  I think five reviews and none of them are from the, from the major media outlets either. So they're [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3656.2599999999998s)]
*  just, they're just ignoring it, but I don't think they don't, they don't want to set it. They don't, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3661.14s)]
*  they don't want to sit down in an uncontrolled environment and, and, and talk to you because I [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3666.02s)]
*  think again, that they know at some level that what they're saying doesn't make any sense. And [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3671.3s)]
*  they also know that they know they can't answer the question. You know, I've, I've staked everything [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3675.46s)]
*  on this, what is a woman question? And if one of them could come along and coherently answer it, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3679.62s)]
*  then that would just, that would blow me out of the water. I mean, that's, everything's done then. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3683.14s)]
*  Yeah. And they've had all this time to come up with it with an answer and none of them have gone [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3686.58s)]
*  with it. So they know they're not going to sit down with me because they know that it's, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3690.34s)]
*  that's going to be a big part of the conversation. Like if you, you got it, we got to start by you [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3693.3799999999997s)]
*  defining your terms. And if you can't do that, then I don't know how to talk to you. If we can't [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3696.1s)]
*  define the terms. Well, they always want to dismiss you as some far right talking point person. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3701.62s)]
*  That's the first way they do it. And to ignore your film seems to me to you're ignoring an [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3708.58s)]
*  opportunity to take something apart that you disagree with. Like why would they do that? They [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3715.7799999999997s)]
*  do that with everything else. It's one of the more unique things is that the ignorant, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3720.26s)]
*  they feel like things are moving in the right direction. It's almost like strategically, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3725.7000000000003s)]
*  it would be detrimental to engage with you because they must understand that a lot of [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3730.6600000000003s)]
*  these belief systems that they've adhered to, they're cult like, it's ideological. It doesn't [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3738.26s)]
*  make sense. It's not grounded in reality. It's all, it also, there are inherent dangers to doing [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3743.38s)]
*  this to children that are very difficult to ignore and that parents are going to resonate [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3748.9s)]
*  with like instantaneously when they think about their children and how vulnerable children are [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3754.7400000000002s)]
*  and how malleable they are and how susceptible they are to cultural trends. And the fact that [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3758.98s)]
*  they won't engage with you on this, it really speaks volumes. Yeah, I mean, it does. I think [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3764.82s)]
*  they also realize that, and we call it ideological and political. I think it's, it's also, it's, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3770.5s)]
*  it's a really a spiritual, it's like a religious claim. I mean, that this is a gender ideology is [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3775.14s)]
*  a religion, I think it behaves in every way like a religion. And it's actually interesting. It's [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3778.8199999999997s)]
*  kind of revealing that one thing you hear from the proponents is this claim that actually there [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3785.54s)]
*  are analogs for transgenderism all across the world and other cultures and throughout history. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3792.42s)]
*  That's what they always say. We tested this in the film. We went outside of the Western culture [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3796.74s)]
*  bubble. We went all the way to Africa to talk to a traditional tribe there about this stuff. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3801.7s)]
*  And, and they were just, they were, their minds were blown by it in a bad way. They had never [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3805.7s)]
*  encountered ideas like this before, because of course these, you know, the gender binary is not [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3814.66s)]
*  a Western construct. The rejection of the gender binary is a Western construct. But going back to, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3818.66s)]
*  you know, when they point to what are supposed to be analogs or other examples of this kind of thing [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3823.9399999999996s)]
*  in other cultures, sometimes they're just making it up. But then there are times when, you know, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3827.94s)]
*  there might be a culture that has some notion of like, you know, maybe a man acting out the part [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3832.82s)]
*  of a woman or something like that. That happens in other cultures, cross-dressing. Yeah, that exists [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3838.42s)]
*  in other cultures. But the difference is, number one, they don't, in those cultures, they don't [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3842.1s)]
*  think that the man actually is a woman. Like they don't believe in pregnant men in those cultures. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3846.82s)]
*  They know that he's acting out something. That's the point. And then the other point too is that [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3851.14s)]
*  in these other cultures where this exists, very often it is like a religious, spiritual sort of [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3855.2200000000003s)]
*  thing. They talk about, in fact, they include it now in the LGBT acronym as Two Spirit, which is [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3860.34s)]
*  supposed to be the Native American version of transgenderism. Yes. And that was invented in [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3866.58s)]
*  1990 by gay activists. So it's not like this goes all the way back to the, you know, Comanches on [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3872.9s)]
*  the Great Plains. But even that, think about the Two Spirit. It's spiritual. That's a religious thing. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3876.34s)]
*  Which is really what they're doing here. This is really- That's what the Two is? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3885.3s)]
*  Yeah, Two Spirit. So in the LBGTIA2-plus? Yeah, Two Spirit. That's what Two Spirit is. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3888.02s)]
*  Two Spirit, yeah. That's a new one. How long is that going to get? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3899.46s)]
*  I mean, there's no limit. And also because the identities are becoming redundant. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3903.86s)]
*  You know, they- Right. Like gay and queer. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3909.78s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, demisexual is one of the newer ones, I think. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3912.82s)]
*  Is that in there? I don't know if it's in there. I mean, it's a thing, demisexual. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3916.82s)]
*  Should be. What are they, bigots? Put it in there. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3920.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But what is- You know what, I looked it up once. Demisexual is [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3922.5s)]
*  a person who needs to be emotionally attached to someone or needs to emotionally connect to [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3929.1400000000003s)]
*  someone in order to be sexually attracted to them. And you hear that and you're like, well, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3934.9s)]
*  so that's women. That's what a woman- That's like every woman. And then there's also- It's [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3938.66s)]
*  ridiculous. I don't remember the label, but there's the opposite of that too. They're the people that [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3946.3399999999997s)]
*  don't need the emotional attachment, but they still have sexual erotic feelings. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3950.74s)]
*  I was under the impression that in Native American populations, that that Two Spirit thing was- That [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3956.5s)]
*  was a historical thing. That they had always had members of their tribe and that they valued, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3962.5s)]
*  that seemed to have the perspective of both a female and a male, and that they could make [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3968.98s)]
*  sense of things. The term Two Spirit was coined, I believe, in 1990. What they'll claim is that, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3973.22s)]
*  yeah, the term might have been coined in 1990, but it speaks to something that existed before. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3981.7s)]
*  But even if that's true, my point is that, number one, you're talking about- You are talking about [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3986.34s)]
*  something spiritual, which is not what the gender ideologues are claiming here. They're claiming [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3991.14s)]
*  something- They're not saying it's spiritual. They're saying it's physical. A trans woman is [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=3997.7s)]
*  a woman. A man who says he's a woman actually really is one. Not just spiritually as one, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4001.54s)]
*  but is one. That's the difference in the way it's being approached today. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4006.5s)]
*  It's a really significant difference. Now, if they want to just admit that they're making a [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4010.5s)]
*  spiritual claim and what they're claiming is that, I don't know, a man can end up with a woman, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4015.46s)]
*  the soul of a woman or something like that, that would be progress, at least, because now we are [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4019.62s)]
*  framing this conversation correctly. I still think it's an incoherent claim, but how can a man have [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4024.98s)]
*  the soul of a woman? By definition, if a man has a soul, then it's a man's soul by definition. That's [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4030.2599999999998s)]
*  how you define the soul of a man. Yeah, I guess. That's a tricky one, because what's- Prove a soul. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4039.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. That's my point. At least if they would just admit that this is a- What we're trying to [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4047.78s)]
*  point to is some kind of spiritual essence. Then we can have that conversation, and I still disagree, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4055.3s)]
*  but at least you're admitting that there's nothing physical here. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4062.02s)]
*  What is the longest conversation you had when you were filming this documentary? What is the [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4066.6600000000003s)]
*  longest sit down you had with some of these people? Somebody on the- Yeah. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4072.34s)]
*  Probably Marcy Bowers, the sex change surgeon, talked to him, who identifies as a her for, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4080.34s)]
*  I don't remember the exact amount, I think it was over an hour. She seemed very confident [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4088.42s)]
*  when she was talking about these things. Yeah. Most of the people we talked to on that side were [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4092.82s)]
*  really closed off and didn't want to open up and say anything. That was not the case with Marcy [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4099.94s)]
*  Bowers. Although there's an interesting thing that made it into the film there, where I brought up [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4104.099999999999s)]
*  trans-abled people, which is a real phenomenon. People who feel like- Someone who has two arms [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4110.099999999999s)]
*  feels like he should have one arm. Yeah. Should we take that self-identity seriously? What I was [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4116.58s)]
*  told by Marcy Bowers is no, that's kooky, exact words. But then the WPATH, which is the world, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4122.179999999999s)]
*  which is supposed to be the preeminent transgender health organization in the world, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4128.74s)]
*  they had their conference, I think it was in Canada a few weeks ago, and they had a guy [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4133.94s)]
*  presenting something in the conference saying that actually this kind of body dysmorphia is now a [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4140.58s)]
*  valid gender identity. A eunuch, someone who's a eunuch who wants to amputate their male genitals [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4146.82s)]
*  and yet does not identify as female, just wants to amputate them. They identify as that way. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4152.42s)]
*  That now that's a valid gender identity. I was told a few months before that, that that's kooky. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4156.18s)]
*  Then fast forward a few months, WPATH is saying, well, no, that's a valid gender identity. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4164.1s)]
*  That's what's interesting about the social contagion aspect of it, is that it does seem [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4169.3s)]
*  to spread and change and morph depending on what people accept and what people are willing to agree [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4174.5s)]
*  to. Then once people do agree to that, that a eunuch is a valid sexual identity, that'll become [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4180.9800000000005s)]
*  doctrine. Yeah. It makes sense too, because if what we're being told is that you cannot disagree [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4187.780000000001s)]
*  with someone's self-identity, then there's no floor there. Then whatever someone claims about [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4197.14s)]
*  themselves, we have to affirm it. That includes trans species, transracial, all that kind of stuff. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4204.58s)]
*  I don't even think of that as slippery slope. Something like transracialism, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4212.34s)]
*  that's not further down on the slope. That's actually less crazy than transgenderism. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4216.9s)]
*  Yeah, because all human beings evolved from Africa. It is less crazy. The reason why there's [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4222.26s)]
*  the differences in the way human beings look and the way we evolved, because we spread to [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4229.38s)]
*  different climates in the world, and the human body adapted to those climates. That's the reason [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4234.9s)]
*  why people are so pale in the place where there's no fucking sun. This is all biology. They understand [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4239.78s)]
*  this. It's more logical to be transracial. Race actually is fluid. You can do multiple races. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4246.1s)]
*  Yeah. We skipped that, and we just went right to the transgender thing. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4253.46s)]
*  Most people that support transgenderism will say that Rachel Dolezal, they'll say, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4261.0599999999995s)]
*  oh, she doesn't count as black. They skipped over it. I think eventually we'll circle back and [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4265.0599999999995s)]
*  hit all those bases we skipped. You think so? I think transracialism will be accepted. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4271.46s)]
*  It has to be. Did you see that TikToker who identifies as Korean, so they got a... [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4276.66s)]
*  Yeah. Ali something, I think. Yeah. Again, it makes more sense to me to be transracial. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4281.94s)]
*  It doesn't make sense, but it makes more sense. Yeah. Do you ever sit back? You're probably as [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4295.0599999999995s)]
*  deeply invested into this after doing that film as anybody in terms of the amount of time and [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4302.099999999999s)]
*  effort that you've put into this subject. Do you ever sit back and wonder where this goes? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4307.06s)]
*  If this continues to accelerate, because it seems like something that's accelerating, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4313.54s)]
*  is it just a pendulum swing or it's going to go so far one way that people are going to reject [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4318.1s)]
*  and it's going to swing back the other way? Where does this go? Yeah, I do think about that a lot, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4324.02s)]
*  and I really don't know. I think the stuff with the kids, I think what's happening to kids, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4329.38s)]
*  I do think there's a building backlash to that, and I see the dam breaking there. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4338.34s)]
*  I think people are just rejecting it. That's an area, that's a part of the fight that I think we [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4342.82s)]
*  can actually win and relatively soon. I think we are winning it, because people intuitively, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4348.74s)]
*  they see that and most people, you don't have to explain to them why it's wrong to transition kids [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4353.86s)]
*  all you have to do is tell them that it's happening. Because most people don't know that [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4359.3s)]
*  it's happening and then once they're aware that it's happening, they're like, oh yeah, that's crazy, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4362.26s)]
*  we can't do that, no matter where they fall in the political spectrum. Have you thought about [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4365.46s)]
*  putting together a comprehensive group of interviews of detransitioners and making a documentary on [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4368.58s)]
*  that? I don't know about a documentary, but we actually are working on something like that right [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4373.7s)]
*  now, talking to detransitioners. That's the fallout from all this. That's the horrible loss, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4378.5s)]
*  is these people that made these decisions when they were kids, whether they were urged to [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4385.22s)]
*  or influenced to or whatever, and now they're stuck. And all of their stories, and I've talked [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4391.38s)]
*  to a bunch of them and there are other interviews that are out there telling their stories, [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4398.740000000001s)]
*  the stories are just so infuriating and tragic, what's happened to these kids. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4402.5s)]
*  And now they're stuck. It's like the adult version of themselves is stuck in this prison [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4409.38s)]
*  that was stuck with choices that the child version made, but really the child version [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4416.02s)]
*  didn't make those choices because children can't make choices like that. The choices that were [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4420.66s)]
*  imposed on them. And that's the kind of thing that, yeah, when people hear those stories, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4424.26s)]
*  I think most Americans, no matter where they fall in the spectrum, they hear that and they [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4429.46s)]
*  immediately, viscerally react a certain way. So I think that we could see a backlash from [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4434.02s)]
*  that. When it comes to gender ideology in general, I think it's a much longer fight. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4439.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a generational battle. How much coverage has this gotten or how many views, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4445.14s)]
*  do we know how many people have seen that documentary? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4451.3s)]
*  Not exactly, because what I can say, so the Daily Wire, when the film came out, we got [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4458.42s)]
*  300,000 subscribers from the film, people who wanted to watch the film, 300,000 subscribers in [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4465.299999999999s)]
*  a couple of weeks. Prior to that, the Daily Wire over five years had gotten 600,000 subscribers. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4470.74s)]
*  So we increased it by 50% in just a couple of weeks. In terms of how many total people [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4474.82s)]
*  have been exposed to the film, it's hard to tabulate because we've got all the people on [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4482.66s)]
*  the Daily Wire platform and they're all the clips that are circulating all over, especially on [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4485.86s)]
*  TikTok. Apparently it's a big thing on TikTok. I'm not on there. I wasn't supposed to mention it [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4489.94s)]
*  on air, but then also there's these bootleg copies people have, which you shouldn't watch. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4496.5s)]
*  Uploaded to other platforms. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4502.26s)]
*  Right. The point is it's just a presence that's out there. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4503.86s)]
*  Millions? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4508.18s)]
*  I would say millions. I mean, I predicted millions before and I was wrong. In this case, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4509.3s)]
*  definitely millions. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4514.5s)]
*  For you, when you had a sense of what this problem was before you made the documentary, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4519.3s)]
*  is it worse than you thought it was? What is it like for you as a person, as a parent, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4525.94s)]
*  going over this material and investing so much time into it, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4532.42s)]
*  and then having a newfound sense of what this problem really is? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4536.5s)]
*  Yeah, filming it, we would go, I can remember we went to California, we went to San Francisco, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4539.78s)]
*  we're walking around San Francisco. That's where we talked to the sex change surgeon, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4545.06s)]
*  Mark DiCano, and talking to people on the street. It was very emotionally, [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4548.9800000000005s)]
*  just sitting across the room with people like this and they're saying all this stuff. It's [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4555.62s)]
*  emotionally draining. But then coming home and seeing my own kids, I was like, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4560.34s)]
*  draining. But then coming home and seeing my own kids and knowing that all of this is waiting for [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4566.82s)]
*  them out in the world, and they're younger, they haven't been exposed to it yet, thank God. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4572.900000000001s)]
*  But it's there. There are these forces out there that want to take their innocence, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4577.9400000000005s)]
*  take their, again, their knowledge of themselves away from them. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4583.78s)]
*  It does fill you with a lot of trepidation. I mean, especially parents of younger kids [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4591.38s)]
*  are just terrified. I talk to parents all the time that are terrified of this. They're [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4595.06s)]
*  terrified of the day when their daughter comes home and says, I'm a boy, like it's happened to [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4600.02s)]
*  so many other parents. They live in fear of it. Do you take any hope in the response to this film? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4607.22s)]
*  Because the response has been from the people that I've seen, that I've talked to, and obviously it's [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4616.42s)]
*  a bias group, has been overwhelmingly concerned that at least you've sort of sounded the alarm [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4621.06s)]
*  and let a lot of people know that aren't on TikTok, that aren't paying attention to social [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4628.9800000000005s)]
*  media, but then some parent at a volleyball game pulls them aside and says, there's something you [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4633.46s)]
*  should watch. Yeah, I do feel encouraged by that. I find some hope in it. And even, like I said, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4638.9800000000005s)]
*  going to college campuses and yeah, there's the protests, but also we've got these huge rooms of [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4646.58s)]
*  kids that are coming, they want to watch the movie. So those of us who understand the reality [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4651.14s)]
*  and are proponents of objective biological reality, we're not as alone and outnumbered as [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4658.9s)]
*  we think we are. I don't think we're outnumbered at all, in fact. The problem that we face is that [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4663.38s)]
*  the institutions are against us. So we might have the numbers, but we don't have the institutions, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4667.94s)]
*  the medical field, the academia, the school system, government, they've all been captured. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4672.42s)]
*  So that's the big challenge that we face, I think. I do agree that you're not outnumbered, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4682.58s)]
*  and I think that the numbers overwhelmingly are concerned. The numbers of parents, the number of [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4689.06s)]
*  people that are rational are overwhelmingly concerned. It's just so strange to me that the [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4693.86s)]
*  media, especially left-wing media, seems overwhelmingly to be in support of this minority position. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4699.22s)]
*  Yeah, because they exist in their bubble, and they're all far left. And these bubbles are very [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4709.14s)]
*  real and powerful. That's the other thing that really jumped out of me making the film, is that [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4717.62s)]
*  you go into these areas. I think that's one of the reasons why some of these people are willing to [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4721.14s)]
*  sit down with us to begin with, is that they live in this bubble where nobody would ever challenge [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4726.42s)]
*  these ideas. Everyone is bought in, and they can't even imagine that anybody would disagree. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4731.14s)]
*  And that's our media. They're all Los Angeles, California, whatever. That's Hollywood media, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4736.66s)]
*  New York, DC. So they live in these bubbles, and they've insulated themselves from criticism. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4743.06s)]
*  Have you talked to anybody that had one opinion of it and then saw your film, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4752.18s)]
*  and it changed their mind? Yeah, I've heard that a lot. I haven't specifically heard from someone [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4756.42s)]
*  who was far left, purple hair, and they had an awakening moment from the film. I hope that that [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4762.58s)]
*  happens, and it has happened. I haven't heard that. But it's more I've heard from a lot of people who [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4768.18s)]
*  didn't believe or weren't willing to accept that this was a big problem, and now understand [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4776.26s)]
*  otherwise. And then, yeah, some people who identify more on the left and were sort of okay with it, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4781.3s)]
*  and weren't very comfortable with it, but they were okay with it, and they thought that, well, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4785.38s)]
*  let's just be polite and go along with it. Then they see the film, and they hear us talking about [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4789.22s)]
*  it, and they see that this is not something that they can count on. Where does this go, Matt? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4792.58s)]
*  Where does this go? Who would have ever thought we'd be here? So where does this go? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4801.38s)]
*  It's hard, because like I said, it seems as though we've already seen the craziest [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4812.1s)]
*  manifestation of this. So I do think that we move on to this destruction of reality will continue, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4820.1s)]
*  and it will get into other forms of identity, and so transracialism, even trans species, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4828.58s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff. So I think that that will happen. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4833.14s)]
*  What I'm worried about is for my kids' generation, Gen Z, fast forward 20 or 30 years, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4840.820000000001s)]
*  what does it look like for them? What does that generation look like? What's the suicide [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4848.02s)]
*  rate among Gen Z and the youngest generation in 20 or 30 years after they've all, so many of them [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4854.42s)]
*  have bought into this, and maybe they've gotten the drugs, the surgeries, and then 20 or 30 years [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4862.820000000001s)]
*  hence, what's that? I think we're looking at just the suicide rate already is sky high. I think [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4867.14s)]
*  we're looking at a historic, unfathomable epidemic in the future. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4873.06s)]
*  Do you think that litigation, do you think that people suing people for having done this to them, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4878.74s)]
*  when they were younger, do you think that in any way would try to right this ship? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4884.18s)]
*  I don't think it rights it, but I do think that needs, and there needs to be legislation that [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4890.42s)]
*  opens up that possibility, because as it stands right now, people that are the victims of this, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4893.62s)]
*  they don't really have any legal recourse. They don't? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4897.780000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. This is what I've heard. Essentially, they don't. One of the reasons [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4900.740000000001s)]
*  is that, yeah, the doctors perform these procedures where the procedures are illegal to do, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4905.62s)]
*  and it is ethically and morally, it's medical malpractice, but it's not legally medical [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4911.14s)]
*  malpractice, because they're allowed to do this to kids. But they're not allowed to do it to minors, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4918.1s)]
*  right? Are they allowed to do it to minors? Well, it depends on what we're talking about. The [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4922.58s)]
*  drugs, they're certainly allowed to. Double mastectomies, they're allowed to. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4926.42s)]
*  Genital surgery? Genital surgeries. It depends on the state and where you are, but there are [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4930.02s)]
*  definitely states where these genital surgeries are happening to minors, absolutely. They're not [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4934.5s)]
*  as common as the drugs and the double mastectomies, but they are certainly happening. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4937.78s)]
*  It shouldn't be legal, but it is. Doctor does this to you, then what's your legal recourse down the [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4944.179999999999s)]
*  line? That's the problem. That's why the laws need to change, to give people that recourse, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4951.62s)]
*  to protect kids right now, but then also to give them legal recourse down the line. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4957.3s)]
*  When you make a film like this, how much does this affect your daily life? Obviously, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4961.38s)]
*  you got engrossed in the subject. How much does this affect your daily life? How much does this [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4971.14s)]
*  affect the way you view the world? As a parent, looking at the future and hope for the future, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4976.74s)]
*  because it seems like this is just one aspect of a deterioration of our society that's prevalent. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4983.38s)]
*  It's, I don't want to say despairing. You don't want to be despairing, because despairing is [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4991.86s)]
*  you've given up hope. Then what's the point of even talking about it at that point? I'm not [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=4999.38s)]
*  despairing, but sometimes I feel close to the edge of that, I suppose. It has been, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5003.46s)]
*  you know, on one hand, I feel like there's not a lot of hope for the future, but then at the same [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5017.7s)]
*  time, we put the film out and it gets the kind of response that it does. I do see this building [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5024.0199999999995s)]
*  backlash against at least what's happening to kids. I think what I mentioned before is kind of it, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5028.339999999999s)]
*  that's the tension, is that we do have the numbers, and so there's the hope in that. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5034.259999999999s)]
*  But the institutions that run the country are so completely captured. To claim those institutions [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5039.0599999999995s)]
*  back, that's the generational project. Yeah, when you saw Biden get interviewed by that trans TikTok [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5044.74s)]
*  star, imagine of all the people he chose to be interviewed by. What bizarre narrative are they [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5052.179999999999s)]
*  trying to push where they promoted the president getting interviewed by this super bizarre TikTok [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5063.38s)]
*  star that talks about being a woman for 260 days. I've been a woman for 260 days. God bless you. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5071.78s)]
*  Yeah, and meanwhile, Biden doesn't believe any of this stuff. He's 80 years old. He lived the first [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5078.66s)]
*  70 years of his life and nobody was questioning whether men or women are women. For the first 70 [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5083.94s)]
*  years of his life, men used the men's restroom and men were men and women were women. Then I'm [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5089.62s)]
*  supposed to believe that at the age of 70, he had this awakening moment and realized that everything [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5095.54s)]
*  he thought he knew about biological sex is wrong. I don't believe it. I would love if somebody would [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5101.06s)]
*  ask him that. Which just highlights the mercenary nature of politicians. I would love for someone [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5106.820000000001s)]
*  to ask him, Mr. President, you decided relatively recently in your life that women have penises. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5111.9400000000005s)]
*  What made you decide that? How did you have this conversion experience? What was your road to [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5120.740000000001s)]
*  Damascus moment when you realized that women have penises? That would be a hilarious clip. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5124.820000000001s)]
*  Watch him stammer through that. I would love for someone to ask that question, but they're not [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5129.46s)]
*  going to ask it. Yeah, Dylan Mulvaney is in the White House. This is how infuriating it must be [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5133.46s)]
*  for him to be a woman, is that Dylan Mulvaney is a dude and then decides one day, I'm going to become [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5139.46s)]
*  a man. 45 seconds later, he's got corporate sponsorships. He's got brands lining up to do [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5145.9400000000005s)]
*  commercials with him. He's speaking at women's summits and he's speaking to the President of [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5152.58s)]
*  the United States in the White House. Meanwhile, there are all these women who are actual women [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5156.34s)]
*  and they've been women forever. They're sitting there like, well, if you want a woman to talk to [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5160.18s)]
*  you, I'm here. Dave Chappelle has a great joke about Caitlyn Jenner becoming woman of the year. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5163.62s)]
*  Have you seen that bit? Yeah, right. The M&M. 15 seconds later, right. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5170.5s)]
*  Well, look at this Rachel Levine thing. This is the first four-star admiral that's a woman. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5176.18s)]
*  They even said female, female four-star admiral. You're not even saying woman anymore. Now you're [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5184.26s)]
*  using biological terms. Yeah, that's the sleight of hand trick that they pulled that not enough [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5190.82s)]
*  people have noticed. Because for so long they said, well, sex and gender are two different things. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5196.74s)]
*  Sex is your biological nature and then gender is your whatever. Your perception of yourself. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5202.02s)]
*  But now, recently, they've started using the terms interchangeably. Yeah, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5208.1s)]
*  Rachel Levine is a female. So they have, after spending decades saying don't conflate sex and [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5212.1s)]
*  gender, that's exactly what they're doing now. They've made the terms interchangeable, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5216.9800000000005s)]
*  which is why we should just get rid of the term gender entirely. We don't need it. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5221.14s)]
*  All you need is sex, male and female. That comes from language. Words have gender. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5224.900000000001s)]
*  People don't. We don't need that because we already have sex to describe ourselves. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5232.5s)]
*  I think it's fascinating too, the wholesale rejection of this in the Latino community. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5237.3s)]
*  Especially that term Latinx. They're like, no, the entire language is formulated on female [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5242.58s)]
*  and male. Like A's and O's. It's been there forever. Yeah, this is white liberals who are [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5251.3s)]
*  trying to colonize. They accuse the other, they're always using the word colonization, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5259.54s)]
*  calling us colonizers. But this is actual colonization of language that they're attempting. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5264.26s)]
*  By going to Spanish-speaking people and saying you have to completely fundamentally alter your [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5269.14s)]
*  entire language because I don't like it. I don't even speak Spanish. I don't like it. You have to [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5272.9800000000005s)]
*  change it. Of course they're going to reject it. But again, when you get outside of the white [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5277.860000000001s)]
*  liberal western bubble, you don't have to go that far outside of it. But once you do, you find that [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5282.820000000001s)]
*  these are people who just don't, they don't have these fundamental presuppositions that we have [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5288.42s)]
*  here. So for them it just doesn't make any sense. For us, we've grown up with a lot of these ideas. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5294.66s)]
*  The idea that sex and gender are two different things. Maybe we weren't very aware of it, but [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5302.98s)]
*  it was just kind of floating out there, these ideas. We've absorbed them, whether we know it or not. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5306.82s)]
*  And so there are claims that the gender ideologues make that don't make any sense. But at first to [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5311.3s)]
*  a lot of people, it seems like they do. It just seems like intuitively it makes sense. Because [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5319.22s)]
*  they've grown up in this culture where these ideas are out there. But you go to cultures where these [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5322.9s)]
*  ideas don't exist at all, and you start talking about this, it just it reveals the total absurdity [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5326.179999999999s)]
*  of it. It's just it's absolute nonsense. How did you get involved in being a social commentator? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5330.0199999999995s)]
*  Like what was your path? You started off in radio? Yeah, I was a just small market radio for, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5335.46s)]
*  I don't know, eight years or so. And then I just started up blogging. I started a website, a blog, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5344.179999999999s)]
*  and I was just writing, you know, just writing my random thoughts on anything. And I managed to [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5351.46s)]
*  gather a following relatively quickly. And this was back, this is back when, you know, on social [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5356.18s)]
*  media, it was it was like the Wild West days. And you could, you could actually access, you build a [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5365.06s)]
*  following, you could actually access your whole following. And, and you could basically say whatever [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5369.7s)]
*  you want, you weren't gonna get kicked off. So I was able to build take advantage of that. And [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5374.02s)]
*  but then once I saw them closing all of that off, and you build your Facebook following, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5378.18s)]
*  but you can you post something, and you can only they'll only show it to like point 1% of [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5382.0199999999995s)]
*  your followers or whatever. At that point, it became clear that I need to, you know, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5386.34s)]
*  to do this independently is is not feasible. So I went over and worked for the blaze, which is Glenn [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5390.82s)]
*  Beck's outfit for a few years and then ended up with the daily wire. Did you have any inkling of [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5395.78s)]
*  where this was initially when you were first on social media, everybody sort of assumed that [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5402.42s)]
*  you're going to have these competing ideologies, you're going to have people on the right and [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5407.06s)]
*  people on the left, and they're going to have disputes, and they're going to mock each other [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5411.3s)]
*  and memes. And, and it was seen seemingly, you know, how it was for a while, until it seemed [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5414.820000000001s)]
*  like Donald Trump. When Donald Trump came along, then people realize like, hey, this is a real [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5422.580000000001s)]
*  problem. You know, these ideologies can actually promote a president and this guy can get into [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5427.14s)]
*  office, we're opposed to him, we have to do everything we can to stop this from happening. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5431.780000000001s)]
*  And one of the ways to stop it from happening is to sort of marginalize or silence right wing [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5435.7s)]
*  voices online. But what that does is hardens people to this notion that there is a conspiracy [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5441.22s)]
*  against them, and that there is censorship and that there is an ideology that's overwhelmingly [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5449.54s)]
*  supported by the media, that a large percentage of the population is opposed to. Yeah. And that [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5455.86s)]
*  rational reasonable discourse amongst people with differing ideas is discouraged, which is [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5463.38s)]
*  fucking dangerous. It's not good for understanding what ideas are good and what ideas are invalid and [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5469.46s)]
*  seeing them all argued and fleshed out and having debates has always been the way we can discern [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5476.5s)]
*  and discern what's right and what's not, what's correct, what resonates with me, what makes sense, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5483.14s)]
*  who makes a more valid logical argument. Yeah. That's one of the more disturbing aspects of [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5488.82s)]
*  controlled tech, of tech being censored. And one of the reasons why I have great hope in Elon Musk [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5495.46s)]
*  taking over Twitter, because I think, you know, Elon has famously stated that he's a free speech [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5502.0199999999995s)]
*  absolutist. And he believes that people should be able to have differing opinions, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5508.099999999999s)]
*  speak civilly about these differing opinions, and do it in an open forum. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5513.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I think you're right that Donald Trump was the turning point, because that was something [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5519.06s)]
*  that from the perspective of the powerful elites, that's just not, that's not supposed to happen. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5522.740000000001s)]
*  He's not supposed to become president. And that was allowed to happen and use social media largely [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5528.18s)]
*  to do it, bypassing traditional media and just going right to, you know, to people on, to the [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5533.14s)]
*  people essentially. And they said, well, we can't, we can't allow this to happen anymore. So then [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5539.3s)]
*  they decided to shut it down. I also think that they, they realized that, you know, you can try [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5543.14s)]
*  to control people by telling them what they can and can't do, punishing them if they do what they're [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5549.3s)]
*  not supposed to do, what you told them they can't do. You can control people that way, which is what, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5554.34s)]
*  you know, of course they do that. But then what's a more effective strategy is to control what people [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5557.46s)]
*  believe. Like if you can get inside their heads and control what they think, then you don't need [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5563.94s)]
*  all the laws that tell them what not to do, because you already own them. So you can, you can control [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5571.78s)]
*  their behavior that way. And that's what a lot of this stuff is with, let's police misinformation or [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5575.78s)]
*  disinformation. We live in the, in the information age, like we're all exposed every day to more [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5582.66s)]
*  information than probably the average person in 1800 was in a lifetime. And this is the, this is [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5588.9s)]
*  the world we live in. So if you can control that, control the information, control people are exposed [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5593.86s)]
*  to, manipulate what they think and what their beliefs are, then you, you know, that's, that's [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5597.46s)]
*  much more powerful than simply like passing laws and telling you what, what you can and can't do. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5603.94s)]
*  Yeah. And that's why I think it's so important to have a neutral platform like Twitter, as opposed [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5608.58s)]
*  to all these other platforms that have emerged that have emerged in response, they've emerged in [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5613.54s)]
*  response to the, the censorship of right-wing voices, because the problem is those become [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5618.42s)]
*  ideological bubbles for the right. And even in those places, like I've heard on truth media, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5623.7s)]
*  if you, you know, if you say disparaging things about January 6th or say disparaging things about [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5628.82s)]
*  the, whether or not the vote was stolen, that you'll be censored, which is like, Jesus Christ, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5634.58s)]
*  this is absolutely the wrong approach to this. Now you're going to encourage even more right-wing [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5640.18s)]
*  ideological thought bubble stereotype behavior, and you're not going to get the real logical debate, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5646.820000000001s)]
*  which is what was, what's important. Yeah. Cause there's a lot of people that, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5654.820000000001s)]
*  you know, this idea that there's people on the right and people on the left and that's it, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5658.9800000000005s)]
*  that's nonsense. There's many of these people share very similar ideas and very similar hopes [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5662.18s)]
*  for society and culture. And I think far more people are probably in the middle. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5668.34s)]
*  They just, they see something that's abhorrent on the left and they go, I can't support Antifa, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5672.74s)]
*  or they see something that's horrible on the right. Well, I can't support these people. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5678.02s)]
*  And they have to find a team that they join. And you feel like this team is the good team [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5682.42s)]
*  and they're going to lead the country in the right direction. And that team is [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5689.62s)]
*  fascist or racist or whatever it is. And if you're connected to that team, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5693.3s)]
*  you have to buy wholesale all the other shit that's a part of that team. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5698.18s)]
*  The only thing that's going to solve that is open debate and communication where people get to [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5701.780000000001s)]
*  really evolve their own ideas and see these ideas discussed. Yeah. I think, yeah, I think most people [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5706.820000000001s)]
*  are, are not very ideological in general. And that's one of the mistakes that Democrats have [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5714.58s)]
*  made going into the midterms is they don't understand that about people. And so they've [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5720.5s)]
*  made their, they've made protecting quote unquote abortion rights, one of their fundamental, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5723.7s)]
*  like one of their central pieces of their, of their campaign platform. But most people just don't [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5730.18s)]
*  care that much about abortion. It's an, it's from, from most people's perspective, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5736.66s)]
*  it's an ideological issue. They don't care that much about it. And the assumption was, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5740.34s)]
*  Oh, Roe v. Wade's overturned. It's going to mobilize voters to come out for Democrats. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5744.18s)]
*  And it just hasn't because most people see that and they kind of shrug their shoulders. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5747.62s)]
*  And I say that as someone who I do care about abortion. I think people should care about it. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5750.26s)]
*  I care about it as a pro-lifer, but I also recognize as a pro-lifer, especially in the pre, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5754.1s)]
*  you know, during the Roe v. Wade days, this was one of the, this was one of the, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5758.18s)]
*  one of the obstacles that we encountered was just like getting people to even care about this to [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5763.3s)]
*  begin with. And now the left is experiencing the same problem. And they, you know, they, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5766.5s)]
*  it's just because most people, what are the issues that they're, they, they wake up in the morning, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5771.46s)]
*  thinking about? They think about, you know, can they, they have enough money to put gas in the car? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5776.02s)]
*  Do they think about their kids? They think about their family? Like these are the things they think [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5780.34s)]
*  about. They don't wake up thinking about abortion rights or January 6th or, you know, anything like [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5783.14s)]
*  that or climate change. You know, I think most of the people that are concerned about the future, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5788.34s)]
*  they're concerned about the economy and they're concerned about the environment. And that's one [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5794.34s)]
*  of the reasons why, you know, environmental fear mongering has taken this front and center stage [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5798.580000000001s)]
*  with the left, because they want it to be the thing that people think about the most. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5806.18s)]
*  And that this is your, you're thinking about the future of the world. And if you vote right, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5810.740000000001s)]
*  you're, you're damning our country to a destruction beyond our imagination. The oceans are going to [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5814.9800000000005s)]
*  boil and we're all fucked. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they, they think about those things. They also think about, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5821.620000000001s)]
*  they think about their, their kids, you know, and maybe this doesn't come through in some of [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5830.1s)]
*  the polls that people take. And when you poll voters and say, what are the issues that you care [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5834.34s)]
*  most about? It's economy is always number one. And that probably is true. But people don't think of [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5837.54s)]
*  their kids as a political issue, even though the left has turned it into that. But that's why [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5843.46s)]
*  this push to, you know, indoctrinate kids into gender ideology, take away parental rights, [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5849.06s)]
*  the grooming of kids that goes on in the school system, the drag queens story, all that kind of [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5854.58s)]
*  stuff. That does mobilize voters, even if they don't say it on a poll, that mobilizes voters, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5858.1s)]
*  because they get to your kid, you're going after their kids. This is what they care about most in [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5863.22s)]
*  the world. Yeah. I think that mobilizes people too. How, now from you starting out, initially [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5866.900000000001s)]
*  writing this blog and developing a social media following, how have your thoughts and your, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5874.820000000001s)]
*  your view of the world, how, how has it evolved and changed? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5881.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, I've probably become more, I've probably become more right wing as this time has gone on. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5884.58s)]
*  How did you start out? Well, I always have been. I mean, I can't say that I was like a liberal who [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5895.14s)]
*  had had an awakening moment or something like that. But it's every, every year I see the kind [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5900.1s)]
*  of cultural decay get worse and worse and reach into other areas of life. And then I had kids [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5910.74s)]
*  myself and when I see people going after kids, trying to take innocence away from kids, it just, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5917.139999999999s)]
*  it just, I guess the phrase is radicalized. I've become more and more radicalized as the years have [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5923.46s)]
*  gone, as the years have gone on. And the left, they complain about people being radicalized. Well, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5928.82s)]
*  it's your doing it. That's your fault. It's just like with the, the Paul Pelosi thing and the media [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5934.26s)]
*  was hand wringing about all the conspiracy theories and well, the so-called conspiracy [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5939.94s)]
*  theories come, come, it's, that's your fault because people don't trust what you're saying. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5945.86s)]
*  You know, they don't trust you. Right. So you blamed it immediately on MAGA supporters. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5948.82s)]
*  That was the first thing. When it turns out this guy lives in this like weird sort of like household [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5953.94s)]
*  filled with free thinkers and BLM flags and pride flags. He lived in a bus outside of a [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5960.0199999999995s)]
*  hippie commune with the BLM flags and he was previously a nudist activist guy. But then they [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5966.9s)]
*  say he got into QAnon and all this kind of stuff. I don't even know if that's true or not, but what [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5973.46s)]
*  I do know is like, this is just a crazy homeless guy addicted. He's like, this is a crazy, crazy [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5977.379999999999s)]
*  homeless guy and he's in San Francisco. So this is a, this is a crazy violent homeless guy in San [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5982.0199999999995s)]
*  Francisco. This is not, you cannot blame Republicans for crime committed in San Francisco. It just [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5988.179999999999s)]
*  doesn't make any sense. It's the chickens come home to roost. Right. I mean, attacking a politician [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=5995.46s)]
*  is supported the very, or at least the home of a politician who supported the very ideas that have [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6000.1s)]
*  enforced that shit. Yeah. Yeah. A politician who has supported to my view, the, um, destruction of [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6004.66s)]
*  law and order has, has now been forced to confront some of the consequences of that. That's, that's, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6011.38s)]
*  that's really the story there. Do you smoke cigars, Matt? Uh, I do. Yeah. Want one? Sure. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6017.22s)]
*  Oh, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6025.62s)]
*  seems like we need one. The, um, so the beginning of your career, when you first started doing this, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6033.94s)]
*  when you were, you're more moderate, were you like, how old you seem like you're about [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6040.58s)]
*  when you're in your forties, how old are you? Wow. I'm 36. Are you? Well, you seem mature. 36 is young. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6044.9800000000005s)]
*  So that's, you, you grew up conservative for your family. Was your family conservative? Yeah. I, I, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6051.78s)]
*  I grew up, uh, I have five brothers and sisters. I grew up in a Catholic, [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6059.54s)]
*  Catholic house, still Catholic. Um, and, uh, yeah, I went to public school, so I don't send my kids [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6063.219999999999s)]
*  to public school largely because I went there myself, but, uh, I went into kind of a liberal, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6069.86s)]
*  liberal area and, um, you know, we were, we were always encouraged as kids to, and the situation [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6073.94s)]
*  wasn't nearly, isn't, wasn't nearly as bad then as it is now in public schools, but it was still, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6079.78s)]
*  public school system was very hostile to people with conservative values. And so we were encouraged [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6084.5s)]
*  by my parents to stand up for our values. And we were always told that, like, if you get in trouble [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6090.02s)]
*  in school, because you're standing up for yourself, you're not going to be in trouble at home. You [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6093.78s)]
*  know, if you're, if you're just causing trouble to cause trouble, you will be in trouble. But [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6097.54s)]
*  if you're, um, if you hear the teacher say something that isn't correct or that is, um, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6100.26s)]
*  you know, um, it's like propaganda and you raise your hand and disagree with it, then, uh, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6105.06s)]
*  we were encouraged to do that from a young age. So. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6112.5s)]
*  So was it unusual for you to go into like, uh, political commentary? Was that, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6116.82s)]
*  was that something that was a natural course of progression for you? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6123.3s)]
*  Yeah, it felt, it felt like the right thing to do. I also don't, I don't have any other skills, so [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6127.54s)]
*  I don't know what else I was supposed to do. I think that's a lot of pundits. It's like, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6132.66s)]
*  we, we, we end up there partly because, uh, what else are we going to do with our lives? [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6136.5s)]
*  But, um. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6142.34s)]
*  Did you have any idea though, at any point in time, like the amount of reach that you [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6143.38s)]
*  would eventually have, like when does this beyond your imagination? I mean, you're very [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6146.66s)]
*  popular online right-wing commentator. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6151.94s)]
*  Uh, I suppose it was. I mean, and I think the film, it's, that's one of the effects of the, [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6159.38s)]
*  the, the film. I've noticed a change just in my own life, just since the film came out. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6166.0199999999995s)]
*  How so? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6169.86s)]
*  Um, well, even things like how often I get stopped in public. It's not, I mean, I'm not, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6170.34s)]
*  not, not to Joe Rogan level, but, um, all the time I've stopped people in public who recognize [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6174.26s)]
*  me from the film. And I think some of that is like when you're in the conservative media space, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6179.22s)]
*  it's, it's, it's important, I think, that's where I am. And, uh, you have access to a lot of people, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6184.900000000001s)]
*  but, um, if you, if you kind of stay in there, that's, that's its own bubble. So what is a woman [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6190.34s)]
*  was something that was able to kind of reach outside of that. Um, and so I've, I've certainly [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6196.820000000001s)]
*  noticed that. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6202.34s)]
*  And so when you first started doing social commentary, like what, what were the issues [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6203.62s)]
*  that were concerning you? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6208.42s)]
*  I've always been a life, life, marriage and family guy. That's always what I've, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6211.86s)]
*  what I've cared about the pro life pro life, um, marriage and, and the gender thing. I mean, I, [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6216.9800000000005s)]
*  I, you know, for at least seven or eight years now, I've been on that. I've, I've been, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6225.06s)]
*  I've been on that, you know, for almost as long as I've been doing this on any kind of national [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6229.22s)]
*  level. And what was your initial pull to that? Like what, what, what drew you into that to the [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6232.66s)]
*  gender stuff? Yeah, it was the, it was the Bruce Jenner moment. And again, it wasn't, it wasn't [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6238.1s)]
*  just that it happened and that the media celebrated and all that and woman of the year, it wasn't just [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6243.06s)]
*  that it was that I, I noticed it seemed like people on the right conservatives were just, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6249.46s)]
*  we're going along with it. We're willing to accept it. And that's, and that's what scared me. Um, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6255.780000000001s)]
*  and so I've always seen it as the left's, uh, overall project as they wage this assault on [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6260.740000000001s)]
*  life, marriage and, uh, and gender. Now it's kind of the three-pronged approach. I wrote a book, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6266.58s)]
*  uh, back in, I dunno, it was like 2016 called the unholy Trinity about their three-pronged assault [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6273.0599999999995s)]
*  on life, marriage and gender, uh, redefining all three of these things, which are fundamental, [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6277.78s)]
*  uh, pillars of human society. And so if you can redefine those and tear those down, then, [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6282.9s)]
*  you know, you've, you've, you've won, you've captured the culture. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6290.9s)]
*  Have you taken a lot of time to think about like what causes people to have these fundamental [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6293.9400000000005s)]
*  beliefs? And I mean, I'm of the opinion that most people sort of subscribe to a predetermined [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6300.02s)]
*  pattern of thinking and behavior that either they see around them that's reinforced or that resonates [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6308.1s)]
*  with them because of their family and their upbringing. Like what, what causes people [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6315.3s)]
*  to be so rigid in their ideologies that they're willing to subscribe wholesale to this idea that [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6321.38s)]
*  children can determine their gender at five years old and that a life isn't a life until it's out [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6328.58s)]
*  of the vagina, including at nine months old. Like, have you thought about that a lot? [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6334.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think, well, a lot of it is the environment you grew up in and, uh, you grew up around these [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6339.38s)]
*  ideas. And if you went to public school, I mean, you know, kids today, especially you go to public [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6344.26s)]
*  school and, um, you're there for, uh, six hours a day, five days a week, nine months a year for, [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6348.66s)]
*  for 12 or 13 years. And this is, that's the culture there. And then the kid leaves and, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6355.46s)]
*  but they don't actually escape that culture because now they're on their phone and, uh, [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6361.94s)]
*  they're just in that cloud all the time. And, and, uh, and they're in a, in a world where these, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6365.22s)]
*  all these ideas are just assumed, you don't even question them. Um, and especially if you can [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6371.139999999999s)]
*  introduce, you know, kids at a very young age, they don't even have the mental capacity to [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6375.3s)]
*  distinguish between fantasy and reality. They don't really have the capacity to be truly [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6381.78s)]
*  skeptical about something. Skepticism is a skill that you learn as you get older. Um, they don't [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6385.62s)]
*  really, they don't have that. So they'll just accept whatever you tell them. There's a reason [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6390.1s)]
*  why if you tell a four year old that there's a, you know, a fat man flying through the sky comes [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6392.66s)]
*  on the chimney, they just believe it. Like they don't even, they might have a few questions, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6396.820000000001s)]
*  but the questions are all about the details about this fat guy. The questions aren't questioning [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6400.98s)]
*  the, the basic premise that you've presented to them. So if you can get to kids that young, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6406.66s)]
*  then there's a good chance you'll have them forever. Um, because this is just built into [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6414.179999999999s)]
*  their minds. And one of the reasons why the left, this is why they were so upset about the so-called [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6419.78s)]
*  don't say gay bill in Florida, which of course there was no such bill, but, um, and all that [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6424.339999999999s)]
*  bill was saying is don't talk to kids about this before the, before third grade. And they treated [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6428.26s)]
*  that like, uh, some sort of apocalyptic scenario because they need to get to the kids before they [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6433.38s)]
*  want to get to the kids in kindergarten when they're the most vulnerable and you can just [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6438.26s)]
*  tell them anything and they'll believe it. And they'll probably, and for a lot of people, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6441.62s)]
*  they just keep believing it. Most people never stop to analyze the beliefs that they've always [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6444.42s)]
*  held in their heads. Like no matter where, wherever you are on the spectrum, that's most people. You [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6452.1s)]
*  never stop and really, and really scrutinize your own beliefs that you've always had. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6455.78s)]
*  It seems to me that the only thing that stops that is they're confronted by the realities of [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6460.82s)]
*  achieving things in the modern world and that, you know, just getting responsibility, [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6466.66s)]
*  working, making your way through life. Those are the things that sort of turn people into more, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6474.58s)]
*  into having more conservative mindset. I, I would hope so. And that's the assumption that [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6481.46s)]
*  I've always had. I think a lot of us had is you hear about these, the, you know, right, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6486.34s)]
*  the college snowflakes and once they get out into the real world, right. But now the real world is [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6489.46s)]
*  kind of snowflake-ified. Exactly. Cause we, we forgot that, well, they're, they're the ones who [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6494.74s)]
*  are going to determine what, what, what the real world says. I mean, you know, they don't get to [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6500.42s)]
*  determine reality, but we're going to, we're going to be in a country that they are running, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6504.34s)]
*  that they are reshaping. And so, in many cases, it hasn't worked out that way. They, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6509.3s)]
*  they get out into the real world and, but the real world is still set up to affirm what they believe [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6515.3s)]
*  and, you know, to insulate them from these harsh realities. Which is one of the more bizarre aspects [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6522.900000000001s)]
*  of all this shit to me is that I don't necessarily see, this is why I'm asking you, where does this [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6529.3s)]
*  go? I don't see a clear path to logic and maturity. It doesn't seem like people are going to [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6533.94s)]
*  abandon some of these ideas that are not just ridiculous, but dangerous and, and probably [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6541.94s)]
*  ultimately detrimental for who knows what, what number of young people they're going to go down [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6548.1s)]
*  this road. I don't see this clear, like there's going to come a point in time in their life where [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6553.38s)]
*  they're going to recognize. Like what's that old expression? Show me a young man who is not a [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6559.46s)]
*  liberal. I'll show you a man with no heart. Show you, show me an old man who's not conservative [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6564.26s)]
*  and I'll show you a man with no brain. Yeah. Something like that. Isn't it going like that? [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6568.42s)]
*  Yeah. Something like, I mean, and that's, but they've also been told that being, that opposing [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6572.26s)]
*  ideas are physically dangerous and that if you're around opposing ideas, it could actually do you [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6579.62s)]
*  harm. And I think that they really believe that. I mean, think about if someone really believes [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6586.18s)]
*  that takes that to heart, you know, you're, you're, you're setting something up. I mean, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6589.86s)]
*  Ben Shapiro shows up at this podcast conference and they call his very presence harmful. It's not [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6593.94s)]
*  even, it's like we've gone beyond ideas. It's like a person who has those ideas and isn't even [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6598.42s)]
*  speaking them his very, his presence, his essence is, is harmful to you. Yeah. We read the apology [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6604.18s)]
*  on air. Yeah. It was ridiculous. And it's literally one of the biggest podcasters in the world. And [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6611.06s)]
*  you have a podcast conference. So you'd think that you'd want him there. It's like line up to [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6616.5s)]
*  learn from this guy is one of the most successful podcasters in the world, but I know we don't want [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6621.46s)]
*  him there because he's because his, and it's like, he didn't show up ranting a bunch of right wing [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6624.740000000001s)]
*  things. He just was taking pictures with people, but his presence is it's actually, it's, it's quite [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6629.860000000001s)]
*  terrifying too. It's like, it's almost a pre-genocidal language that you're using. When [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6634.660000000001s)]
*  you start saying that someone's that a certain category of people, their presence is harmful, [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6639.46s)]
*  that's, that sets us up for some dark potential. I think it does. It does set us up for dark [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6646.18s)]
*  potential. Now, when you first started getting into political commentary and social commentary, [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6652.42s)]
*  the world was a much different place and it wasn't so contentious. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6659.3s)]
*  I think, I think it's a lot of these things have gotten worse, but it was, I mean, you saw the [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6664.66s)]
*  seeds of it even by, I mean, it wasn't all that long ago, 10 years ago. I think it was, it was [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6668.66s)]
*  still, it was still there, you know, one of the difference though was that social media existed [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6675.139999999999s)]
*  and it had already taken over society, but you at least were allowed to, you know, for, for a while [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6682.5s)]
*  you know, for a while social media was a forum for actual discussion. It might not have been [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6687.94s)]
*  the most intelligent discussion all the time, but you could, you could be exposed to both sides of [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6693.54s)]
*  any debate on social media for a period of time. And the very least you could develop a following. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6697.54s)]
*  Right. So if your ideas resonated with other people, you could attract a group of people [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6702.58s)]
*  to come and pay attention to you or listen to you. Yeah. That was, that was the case for, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6706.74s)]
*  for a while, but they, you know, they, they shut that down. Maybe it will change now with Elon Musk. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6710.66s)]
*  I don't know. Yeah. I don't think it's going to change with those other platforms, not anytime [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6715.46s)]
*  soon, unless someone like Peter Thiel buys YouTube, you know, I mean, I just don't think it's going to [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6720.58s)]
*  change. And even with Elon Musk, I think, I think it's great that he took over Twitter, but it's [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6724.9800000000005s)]
*  also, it remains to be seen what effect that's going to have. Right. Because you also, it's not [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6728.82s)]
*  just one guy. This is a, this is an institution with thousands of people. And if the whole [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6734.58s)]
*  institution is still against you, even at the top, it could be, we saw it with Donald Trump. I mean, [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6739.14s)]
*  he was president, but the whole federal government apparatus was against him. And so there's not a [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6743.22s)]
*  lot that can be accomplished. And what little you can accomplish can get erased immediately, [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6748.58s)]
*  which is what happened to Trump. The only thing that couldn't take away was the Supreme Court [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6752.9s)]
*  justice. I mean, they'd like to, but they couldn't do that yet. And at a smaller scaling, it's the [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6756.0199999999995s)]
*  same thing kind of with Twitter is that, yeah. So you've got a guy who's rational at the top of the [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6760.82s)]
*  food chain there, but he's sitting atop this pyramid of, you know, leftist radicals. So how [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6765.22s)]
*  much change can actually be made? I don't know. We'll see. Well, one of the more interesting [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6773.06s)]
*  things about a film like yours coming out onto the daily wire is that people would subscribe to the [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6778.1s)]
*  daily wire and at least potentially be exposed to other ideas that way. That if you're, you gotta [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6782.42s)]
*  assume that the sheer numbers of people that watch your documentary, some of them have to be liberal. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6788.1s)]
*  And that might at least expose them to other ideas that they're getting suppressed from in other [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6794.42s)]
*  places. Yeah. I mean, we hope so. And there certainly have been plenty of people who are not [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6800.82s)]
*  died in the wool right wing Republicans who've seen the movie and appreciated it. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6808.58s)]
*  Which by the way, I'm supposed to mention, if you go to whatiswoman.com, we just decided we're [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6815.54s)]
*  going to make the first 15 minutes of it free. So you can kind of get, you know, you can go check [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6819.7s)]
*  it out. You can see 15 minutes of the film and decide if it's, it'll wet your outrage. Yeah. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6824.98s)]
*  Decide it. Decide if it's something you want to, you know, you want to subscribe to watch it. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6829.54s)]
*  I think hopefully you will though. So daily wire as an enterprise started because of the suppression [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6832.34s)]
*  of conservative ideas online. Is that why they decided to have this network? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6841.78s)]
*  I don't think it was just that. I mean, it was originally it started as a, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6847.06s)]
*  basically a conservative kind of news site, which is, which is a political site, which there's still [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6851.780000000001s)]
*  a lot of that. But one thing that we talk about the daily wire is wanting to build an actual [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6856.18s)]
*  cultural institution on the right, which doesn't exist right now. You find that all over on the [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6864.58s)]
*  left, right? They've got a bunch of them, but there really isn't that on the right. The only [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6870.42s)]
*  thing that could make a case for itself will be Fox news. But I think even for Fox news, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6874.74s)]
*  the reach, I mean, they reach a lot of people, but it's just, it's like, it's just, it's Fox news. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6880.98s)]
*  And it's seen a certain way. And so it's, its ability to impact the culture, I think is [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6885.46s)]
*  somewhat limited because of that. But with daily wire, the desire is to build an actual [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6889.7s)]
*  culture institution that can reach into all these different areas of culture and really make an [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6896.179999999999s)]
*  impact that way. So with fictional films as well with fictional films, I mean, what is a woman is [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6899.86s)]
*  it's a documentary. It obviously has a point of view. I don't, I'm not out there in the film [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6910.58s)]
*  preaching that point of view, but I, I, as the person behind the film, I had a point of view [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6917.0599999999995s)]
*  that I wanted to get across. A lot of the other films that the daily wire is made, though, [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6920.58s)]
*  especially the fictional films, there really isn't, there isn't like a political point of view. It's [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6924.179999999999s)]
*  just, it's supposed to simply be entertainment without the, without the political stuff, which [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6927.38s)]
*  I think is a lot of people miss that back and back when you could find those kinds of movies, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6932.1s)]
*  which are increasingly hard to find. Do you have friends that are liberals? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6937.7s)]
*  I do not as many as I used to have that kind of drop off as time as time goes on. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6944.66s)]
*  Have you had disputes with any of your people that used to be liberal friends? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6950.26s)]
*  They, they generally, they, they, they won't come back around and say anything to me. They'll just [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6954.179999999999s)]
*  like, I realized, oh yeah, I haven't talked to that guy in a year. You know, growing up, especially, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6958.099999999999s)]
*  like I said, I grew up in a liberal area, so I had plenty of friends that were liberal. We'd get into, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6963.54s)]
*  you know, where'd you grow up? Baltimore, not the city, but outside of Baltimore. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6967.0599999999995s)]
*  And there was, you know, there's, we would have knock down, drag out type arguments and that sort [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6973.379999999999s)]
*  of thing, which was allowed back then, not as much now though, I guess. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6979.9400000000005s)]
*  And so when you did grow up with these kinds of people, did you ever imagine [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6985.620000000001s)]
*  that there'd be this kind of a divide in this country? Because when I was a kid, I had, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6992.740000000001s)]
*  you know, there was plenty of people that were conservative and liberal. Even my parents had [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=6996.820000000001s)]
*  friends that were conservative. My parents were liberal. It, now you, you don't see a lot of [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7000.02s)]
*  reasonable discussion. Like people seem to have like shored off into their own camps. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7007.06s)]
*  Yeah, I actually think people say that, oh, we're headed for a civil war and all that. And [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7011.14s)]
*  I don't think that we are headed for a civil war because our, the situation in our country [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7017.14s)]
*  is very different now than it was in 1860 in a lot of ways. And one of the, in one way is that the [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7020.58s)]
*  divide is not as explicitly geographical. I mean, there is a geographical component to it, but [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7025.9400000000005s)]
*  you can't just split it down the middle, right? Everything's mingled together. So I don't know if [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7030.66s)]
*  we have the, we really have the atmosphere for real civil war. But I do think that our country [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7034.5s)]
*  is probably more divided now than it was in the civil war because there's just this vast [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7042.18s)]
*  chasm that separates one side from the other. There are no shared beliefs. There are no shared [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7047.62s)]
*  values at all, at least from the two ends of the political spectrum. It's not even a spectrum [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7054.9s)]
*  anymore because there is this severing down the middle of it. Do you think that's by design? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7061.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's by design. It makes it impossible to have a conversation. That's one of [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7069.0599999999995s)]
*  the reasons why political debates are so fruitless often is because in order to have a constructive [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7072.82s)]
*  conversation with someone or even a constructive debate, you have to have some shared frame of [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7079.0599999999995s)]
*  reference that you're both referring back to. And if you don't have that, then what are you talking [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7083.299999999999s)]
*  about? That's one of the reasons why I can sit around in a room with other conservatives [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7088.1s)]
*  and have really passionate debates that feel productive because we agree on the fundamental [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7094.5s)]
*  stuff, but now we're just arguing about some of the details, some of the things that you build on [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7099.780000000001s)]
*  top of the foundation. But when you don't even share the foundation, then there's nowhere to go. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7103.860000000001s)]
*  You just, you reach this impasse like I did in What is a Woman. You eventually come back to, [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7112.1s)]
*  well, what is truth? How do we know if there's a truth? Well, once the conversation devolves into [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7116.82s)]
*  that, there's nowhere to go from there. Well, when you get away from gender, what are the other [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7120.74s)]
*  gigantic divides that you see that are impassable? The big pillar issues, life, the life issue, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7124.74s)]
*  gender, marriage. What about specifically about the marriage one? Well, do you believe that [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7136.5s)]
*  marriage, is marriage fundamentally a procreative male and female union or not? There's not really [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7145.38s)]
*  much of a compromise position there. There's not a compromise in gay men that want to be married, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7154.26s)]
*  they're in love, and they want to formalize their bond so they could see their partner if there's a [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7160.98s)]
*  medical emergency or if there's a death where you assign assets to your loved ones. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7166.98s)]
*  Well, that's not a compromise on the fundamental definition of marriage because that's the question [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7175.379999999999s)]
*  that lies underneath all this. Well, marriage is a legal union between people who love each other, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7181.379999999999s)]
*  right? Isn't that what it is? For what purpose? Why do we need a union? Because they want it to be [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7185.78s)]
*  solidified. They want it to be carved in stone. They want to say, this is not just a person that [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7194.5s)]
*  I love, this is my life partner. Right, but why, as a society, why do we need to solidify or [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7200.34s)]
*  make official a union between people who love each other? If you're with someone you love them, then [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7209.86s)]
*  why isn't that up? What purpose does marriage actually serve in society? What is it doing for [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7215.94s)]
*  society? But it's not necessarily for society, it's for the individual's comfort. If two people [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7223.38s)]
*  decide to stay together and have children and don't ever get married, that's okay too. I mean, [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7230.74s)]
*  we don't have a law against that. So if two people decide that they want to be joined in union [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7235.38s)]
*  and they want it to be legal, they want to really commit, I'm committing so hard, I'm going to bring [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7241.9400000000005s)]
*  lawyers involved and we're going to sign papers and we're going to go over the terms of this. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7247.78s)]
*  But I don't think it is just personal. It is a public institution. That's what we're talking [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7253.9400000000005s)]
*  about. You want the public to recognize this. If it was just personal, then we wouldn't even [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7261.62s)]
*  be having the conversation because people are loving whoever they're loving and that's it. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7266.26s)]
*  There's no way to control that and it is what it is. But what if any negative aspects would there [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7271.86s)]
*  be to people doing that if they're gay? Well, the issue is that from my perspective [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7276.42s)]
*  and from the perspective of most human societies that have existed in history, is that marriage is [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7284.82s)]
*  the context in which the procreative union occurs. Marriage is the foundation for the family. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7294.02s)]
*  It is something that is reserved for that because the male-female union has this capacity to create [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7300.740000000001s)]
*  life whereas no other union has that capacity. And so it is a different kind of thing. And it [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7309.54s)]
*  makes sense to call it something different. It's like if human society were to collapse overnight [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7317.14s)]
*  and we all woke up with an amnesia and didn't remember anything about what happened before [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7323.9400000000005s)]
*  and we're rebuilding society from scratch and we look around and we see that, oh, there are some [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7327.94s)]
*  couplings over here that have this weird habit of creating people and there are other couplings [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7333.94s)]
*  where there are no people being created. We would probably call that something different. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7337.94s)]
*  It's a different kind of thing. It's also more important to society. Society needs that. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7341.38s)]
*  You're going to keep society going because you're creating people. And that's what marriage was. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7347.3s)]
*  It was the context for that procreative union. But what about gay couples who get surrogate [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7353.54s)]
*  parents to carry their children or who adopt children? That's very common. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7361.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's common but the union itself is not creating the child. But it's a man-made [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7366.98s)]
*  institution. We've decided that we should involve the law into joining a male and a female who create [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7373.62s)]
*  a family. Why would that be mutually exclusive? Why would that not apply to a gay couple? [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7380.74s)]
*  Well, again, part of it is it's a matter of definitions. So it's a little bit like the [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7388.58s)]
*  what is a woman question. It's like what is marriage? I mean, I... [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7393.7s)]
*  But doesn't that seem like an easier one? Two people who love each other. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7398.74s)]
*  This is my life partner. This is the person I want to be with to the day I die. Let's get married. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7402.66s)]
*  Everybody is happy. Everybody celebrates. Why just two people? Why just two people? [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7407.54s)]
*  Why only two people with heterosexuals? Because that's not always the case. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7413.78s)]
*  Well, because only two people can create another person. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7417.7s)]
*  No, you can have another person involved and they can have your kid too. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7421.7s)]
*  Isn't that what the Mormons did? Yeah, but only two people can actually create... [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7425.3s)]
*  Two people at a time. Right. Exactly. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7430.26s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I would also, if we want to call it heterosexual [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7432.34s)]
*  polygamy, I'm not a proponent of that because when two people create another person, the person, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7438.58s)]
*  the child that they've created now needs and deserves and has a right to be raised in a stable [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7445.7s)]
*  environment with a mom and a dad who are living together in the house. That's what we should [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7453.22s)]
*  endeavor as a society to provide every child. Children need, they need both. A child needs a [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7457.3s)]
*  mom and a dad. That's the way nature has set it up. Right? So even the idea of two men will raise a [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7464.42s)]
*  baby. So are we saying that the mom is not, we don't, the mom is disposable here, expendable, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7472.42s)]
*  we don't need the mom? That's not what we're saying. We're saying, is it okay if two men [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7479.54s)]
*  raise a baby? Like if a single dad can raise a baby, a single dad's not required if the wife dies. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7483.62s)]
*  He's not required to get married and provide his son with a stepmother. Yeah, he's not required. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7489.62s)]
*  Of course we wouldn't require that. So what if that single dad decides after the mother's gone, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7496.0199999999995s)]
*  you know what? All this time, I've actually been gay and really I want to marry a man. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7500.5s)]
*  Now I'm marrying a man and still continues to raise the son that's his son. Well, I think [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7505.3s)]
*  you know, you can have single parent households, right? But in a single parent household, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7510.1s)]
*  and the child can be raised by a single parent and the child can turn out, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7518.18s)]
*  can turn out okay and have a great and fulfilling life. But it's going to be, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7522.18s)]
*  it's going to be not because there's only one parent, it's in spite of that. That's a hurdle [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7525.860000000001s)]
*  you have to get over. The child is still being deprived of something that is important. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7528.900000000001s)]
*  So to consign a child to that to begin with and say, well, we're going to give you two dads rather [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7535.299999999999s)]
*  than a mom and a dad, because the child was, there was a mom involved in creating the child, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7539.94s)]
*  but she's not going to be anywhere in the picture. I'm just of the, I'm of the view that that's not, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7545.54s)]
*  that the mom is not expendable. She plays a necessary role that cannot be replaced by a man. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7550.74s)]
*  I cannot be my child's mother. My children have a mother, they need her. She does something special [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7559.459999999999s)]
*  and unique in our family. And if they didn't have her, it doesn't mean that they're not going to be [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7566.9s)]
*  able to function anymore as human beings, but they're going to be deprived of something, [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7572.259999999999s)]
*  something important. But even if that is beneficial to have a mother involved and a father involved, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7575.94s)]
*  to have a mother involved and a father involved, surely having one parent only, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7585.78s)]
*  even though it's not ideal, is certainly better than being in foster care. It's certainly better [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7592.58s)]
*  than, you know, being in a home somewhere where there's no parental figure at all. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7598.179999999999s)]
*  And I would think there's a lot of people that are out there that are living a life like that, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7604.34s)]
*  unfortunately. There's a lot of kids that are not adopted. There's a lot of kids that are in foster [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7608.179999999999s)]
*  care. Wouldn't it be better for those kids to be raised by a gay couple who's married? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7612.18s)]
*  I think every child deserves the best possible situation, the best chance that we can give them. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7618.34s)]
*  And so I would say that every child, we should be looking for a man, woman, couple. And also keep in [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7625.22s)]
*  mind too that, especially when it comes to babies, you know, this changes as the kids get a little [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7632.02s)]
*  bit older, but with babies who are up for adoption, there's actually a line five miles long [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7636.42s)]
*  of married couples that want to adopt babies. And they have to wait. They're on waiting lists. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7646.26s)]
*  Talk to parents that have been through this. They've been on waiting lists for years. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7651.86s)]
*  So this idea that there's a scarcity of man, woman, couples willing to adopt kids, I just don't think [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7655.7s)]
*  that that's even true to begin with. I think it's a little bit of a kind of a misnomer. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7665.14s)]
*  It's foster kids that have the issue, right? Kids that are 10, 11, 12. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7669.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's where it becomes. It becomes more of a challenge as kids get older. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7674.1s)]
*  Most people who are adopting are looking for, you know, they want a baby that they can raise the [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7680.26s)]
*  child from as close to birth as possible. Do you think of gay marriage as a personal freedom [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7684.58s)]
*  issue that you should be able to do that? If you were born gay and that's who you are and you meet [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7691.46s)]
*  another person that's gay and you fall in love and decide that you want to be bonded in a union, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7697.22s)]
*  isn't that a personal freedom issue? And shouldn't we encourage personal freedom? [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7702.82s)]
*  I think of it as a definitional issue. So what you think it should be? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7707.54s)]
*  I think of it as a definitional issue. I think of marriage as a certain thing, which is the context [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7712.26s)]
*  for procreation, for the building of the nuclear family. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7718.98s)]
*  What about people that get married that don't have kids? Are you opposed to that? [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7724.42s)]
*  What if they get married and they decide, you know what, we don't need kids. I'm going to get fixed. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7728.5s)]
*  You get your tubes tied. Let's travel the world. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7732.099999999999s)]
*  Well, what do you mean am I opposed to it? I mean, I think that every married couple should [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7734.74s)]
*  be open to life. But what if they don't want to? Are you opposed to them being married? If marriage [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7738.179999999999s)]
*  is only for procreation and to bond a family together, what about people that are deeply in [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7743.7s)]
*  love that never want to have children? I don't think it's it's not only procreation, [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7748.5s)]
*  but that is one of the fundamental definitional aspects of it. Of course, there's more to marriage [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7752.82s)]
*  just than that. And what about people that are infertile? They fall in love and they realize that [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7760.66s)]
*  they can have babies and they don't really necessarily want to adopt. And is that okay [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7765.38s)]
*  for them to be married? Because then you're by definition, marriage falls into a completely [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7769.38s)]
*  different thing because then it's a bond of love. It's a union of love. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7774.66s)]
*  Sure. I mean, that doesn't change the nature of marriage, though. It's a little bit like [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7778.66s)]
*  I say that what's the definition of a woman? Well, a woman is someone who by her nature can [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7785.62s)]
*  conceive children in her womb and bear children. And then the response is always what about women [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7790.82s)]
*  who are infertile? Does that does that destroy your definition of woman? And it doesn't because, [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7794.82s)]
*  you know, it's still it's still a woman's nature to bear children. Not every woman will. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7801.14s)]
*  And there will be disease and infertility and old age and all these things that will [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7805.54s)]
*  preclude that. But it's still it's still of her nature to do so. And I would say the same thing [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7809.780000000001s)]
*  for marriage. I mean, it's it is natural in a marriage for procreation to occur. It's not [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7815.780000000001s)]
*  always going to happen in reality, though. But that's still that's still one of the natural [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7820.740000000001s)]
*  functions of marriage and and married couples who can't conceive children. There are other ways to [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7824.820000000001s)]
*  be parents like adoption, for example, if they want to. Right. But if people want to be married [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7832.1s)]
*  and don't want to ever have children, are you opposed to them being married? Well, I'm not I'm [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7837.46s)]
*  not I would advocate a law that would prevent it. But would it change the definition of what their [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7842.42s)]
*  marriage is to you because they don't want to have a family? They just want to have a loving bond? [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7846.18s)]
*  I think this would be a couple that is rejecting one of the fundamental aspects of marriage. And [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7851.22s)]
*  they should be they they should be open to to life. I would hope that in the future they would be. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7859.14s)]
*  But but isn't that just a personal choice? I mean, you can have a very fulfilling life if you just [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7863.9400000000005s)]
*  follow your pursuits and your dreams and your your interests and you find someone that shares [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7870.1s)]
*  those interests with you and you share time together. It's very fulfilling and loving. Yeah, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7875.700000000001s)]
*  it's a it's a personal choice. And then I'm not advocating for like a law that says that you [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7880.34s)]
*  are married, you have to have you have to have X number of kids. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7884.66s)]
*  But then why are you opposed to two gay people doing that? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7888.82s)]
*  Well, because because again, it's it's it's not about choice. It's about what this institution [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7892.58s)]
*  marriage is an institution and what is it and what purpose does it serve? And I I do not agree with [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7899.14s)]
*  tearing down or changing this definition, especially because the people who have changed [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7908.1s)]
*  the definition haven't come up with a new one. So they say, well, that's not what marriage is. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7913.38s)]
*  So for thousands of years, we said marriage is the procreative union. And then we had the other [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7919.38s)]
*  side who came along and said, well, it's not that. OK, well, then like, what is it exactly? [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7924.66s)]
*  And I know you said, well, it's people who love each other, two people love each other. Well, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7929.86s)]
*  but then why two people? Why do they have to love each other? You know, all these kinds of questions [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7932.58s)]
*  you get into. What if they're in the same family? What if brothers and sisters want to marry? And I [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7937.86s)]
*  know every time that comes up, you know, the advocates for gay marriage will say, well, that's [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7942.26s)]
*  a slippery slope argument. That's a fallacious. But it's actually not. It's like we're trying to [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7945.9400000000005s)]
*  get to what do you even think this institution is now since you've rejected out what we were saying [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7949.9400000000005s)]
*  it was. And I've never found a compelling definition and any definition offered. It's like, [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7954.900000000001s)]
*  it's like, well, what do you what's even the point? Why do we even need this now? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7963.46s)]
*  Mm hmm. I just don't see how a gay marriage in any way damages a straight marriage. I don't I [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7967.139999999999s)]
*  don't see it at all. It doesn't make any sense to me. It just seems to me that people want to be. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7976.339999999999s)]
*  Look, if you if you wanted to look at logic, especially in our modern society, which is [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7981.0599999999995s)]
*  pretty fucked when it comes to relationships, it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent of all [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7987.94s)]
*  marriages in a divorce anyway. They don't make it. You know, if I don't know if anything [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7992.58s)]
*  would damage marriage and damage the institution of marriage is the option of divorce. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=7998.98s)]
*  I don't think gay people and gay people getting married in any way, shape or form changes a bond [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8004.5s)]
*  that you have with your wife. It's just called marriage. It's a human invented thing. If we [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8009.86s)]
*  decide that gay people can get married to, I just don't see how it damages anything. I don't think [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8016.42s)]
*  it tears down the definition of marriage in any way. It just opens up the possibility that people [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8020.9s)]
*  who are gay won't be discriminated against. Yeah, I don't I don't think that a gay couple existing [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8025.86s)]
*  directly impacts. You know, there's a gay couple and wherever and I'm with my wife in our house. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8033.299999999999s)]
*  Like, obviously there's not. But I'm talking about I'm talking about on the individual level [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8039.94s)]
*  and talk about on the societal level. Right. I would agree that divorce, especially, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8044.34s)]
*  you know, there's no fault divorce, rampant divorce. I don't think it's as high as 50 percent. I know [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8051.860000000001s)]
*  that that's the that's often quoted. I'm not sure where that comes from, but it is high. It's like [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8056.26s)]
*  it's too high. And Chris Rock has a great joke about that. Those are just the people with the [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8060.5s)]
*  courage to get out. It's like how many cowards stay. But it's also it's also true that the advocates [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8064.26s)]
*  for what we call now traditional marriage, which I just called marriage, but the advocates for [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8071.3s)]
*  traditional marriage put themselves at a disadvantage by allow, especially in the churches, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8075.78s)]
*  like allowing this rampant divorce to occur. And then you've you've already sort of given up [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8080.42s)]
*  on some marriage is supposed to be monogamous and and permanent as well as procreative. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8087.14s)]
*  Well, you've given up monogamy and permanence. And so now it's not that's that's that's two of [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8092.9800000000005s)]
*  the three legs gone. And so now this assault was waged on the procreative part of it. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8097.62s)]
*  And it was just it was it was difficult to withstand it because the institution had [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8101.78s)]
*  already been weakened. So I agree with you there. But my answer to that is to try to [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8105.3s)]
*  reinforce what marriage is, not to just give up on it entirely. And I still think [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8111.86s)]
*  you're left with this question of like, if marriage is not what I'm saying it is, [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8118.5s)]
*  then what why do we even need it? What's the point? I mean, you're saying it's a it's a manmade [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8123.0599999999995s)]
*  institution. Yes. But you're but you're also like the way that you're presenting it, it's it's also [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8126.9s)]
*  it's a totally meaningless institution. No, they don't need it at all. No, it's not meaningless, [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8133.139999999999s)]
*  because it means something to the people to get married. So it's just it's just a subjective, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8137.78s)]
*  symbolic thing. I mean, what? Yeah. So if you're kind of what it is, look, there's a massive [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8142.9s)]
*  responsibility when you're married and when you have children to keep your family together and [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8148.58s)]
*  you raise and keep everybody happy and healthy. And there's great reward to that. Yeah. But [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8153.94s)]
*  it doesn't always work out. It's not it's not it's people change, people are fucked up that [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8160.099999999999s)]
*  doesn't doesn't always work. And so I don't think it should be outlawed because 50% of the people [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8166.58s)]
*  fall apart. Just like I don't think it has any effect whatsoever on a straight couple. If a gay [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8171.94s)]
*  couple decides that they want to make it official, and that's what it is to them, it gives them a [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8178.98s)]
*  feeling that that they're accepted and appreciated, and that they're not discriminated against [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8184.179999999999s)]
*  because they happen to be homosexual. So what you're articulating to me is the damage that's done [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8190.74s)]
*  by gay marriage to the institution of marriage. But how is it done? How is that in any way damaged [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8199.3s)]
*  straight people? Because we are making the institution meaningless. But it's not meaningless. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8204.18s)]
*  Well, but you just say meaningful to the people that have it subjective, symbolic, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8209.460000000001s)]
*  and it's about your own personal feelings. Isn't it though? Well, no, I would say that it's not. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8213.14s)]
*  It's it's not subjective. It's not symbolic. It's it codifies and protects and gives a name to [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8218.26s)]
*  a thing that actually exists, which is which are, you know, man, woman, couples creating [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8227.300000000001s)]
*  people, creating creating babies. But not always. Right. But that's still that's still the that's [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8232.5s)]
*  still the nature of the union. So but what are the percentage of people today that are married that [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8238.740000000002s)]
*  don't have children? I bet it's pretty high amongst heterosexuals. Probably. Is there something wrong [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8243.380000000001s)]
*  with that? I think there is something wrong with that. I think there is something wrong with, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8249.060000000001s)]
*  you know, getting married and saying, we're just we don't we're not gonna have any kids at all. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8255.7s)]
*  But why is there something wrong with that of someone's personal choice? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8259.22s)]
*  Well, I would that why is it wrong that two people are like, you know, I am deeply committed to work [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8263.06s)]
*  and I don't want to sacrifice any of my career and I don't want to ruin a kid because I'm [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8268.179999999998s)]
*  constantly at the office. But that's where I get deep satisfaction. And and that's that's what I'm [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8274.5s)]
*  focused on. And the woman says that's great, because I don't want children either. I really [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8280.66s)]
*  am attached to my interest in my career and what I like to do. That's not damaging your [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8286.02s)]
*  relationship with your wife and your family. It's I don't certainly I certainly don't think of it as [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8292.18s)]
*  a threat to my marriage or my family. Yeah, it's it is a personal choice. Right. But shouldn't people [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8296.9s)]
*  be allowed to make those personal choices? Like, isn't that a fundamental aspect of what it means [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8303.460000000001s)]
*  to be American to have that freedom? Well, right. Yeah. But right now, we're not talking about what [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8308.42s)]
*  people are allowed to do. I'm not saying we're talking about marriage, gay marriage. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8312.82s)]
*  Okay, we were just discussing straight couples who choose that's also a personal freedom issue. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8316.26s)]
*  Right. Yeah. But and I'm not saying that straight couples should be legally required to have kids. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8321.460000000001s)]
*  But I you know, if you're asking me, do I think it's the right choice to just get married and [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8325.460000000001s)]
*  choose not to have kids ever? I do not think that that's the right choice. It might it's their it's [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8330.74s)]
*  their choice, but people can make choices that are wrong. And you can disagree. How is it wrong if [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8335.220000000001s)]
*  they have a fulfilling and wonderful life together with that choice? If their their thing is that [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8339.7s)]
*  they just want to have a bond between the two of them to just like take it to the next level, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8346.1s)]
*  let everybody know like we are married. If I die, my money is going to go to Helen. And if Helen dies, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8351.140000000001s)]
*  you know, I you know, I'm going to mourn her because she was my wife and I'll be a widower. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8358.02s)]
*  Like to some people, that distinction gives them peace and security and makes them feel better [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8362.34s)]
*  about the relationship that they're both so committed that they've legally signed documents [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8368.5s)]
*  that say that they're bound by law and under the eyes of God or whatever you believe in. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8373.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're able to make that choice. But I think you're they're still rejecting [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8379.54s)]
*  one of the purposes of marriage. And in the scenario that you just outlined, you're also [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8387.54s)]
*  deciding to live a really self-centered life. You're saying what if you're not? What if your [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8393.22s)]
*  work is very charitable? What if it benefits humanity in a deep way? What if you spend a lot [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8399.22s)]
*  of time doing, you know, health care work and, you know, and social work and you're deeply committed [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8404.26s)]
*  to your community? It's not selfish at all. You're just dedicating your time to something other than [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8412.42s)]
*  raising new human beings. Dedicating your life to enhancing other human beings that are around you. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8416.74s)]
*  That's a hypothetical. It is a hypothetical, but so is yours, right? [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8422.42s)]
*  Yeah. But I think most of the people that choose like we're not going to have kids and the and the [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8426.74s)]
*  the rate of those rates are declining. And the age when people first have kids is also going up and [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8430.74s)]
*  all that. Yeah. Most of the people that are making these choices, I don't think it's because they're [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8439.38s)]
*  involved in charity work. I do think that it is more the the scenario you outline in the first [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8444.18s)]
*  time around, which is just like, well, this is what I'm doing. You know, I have my job and I want [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8449.86s)]
*  to give it up. Yeah. But don't you think that people should have the freedom to live their life [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8453.54s)]
*  in that way? I think human beings vary widely in a huge way. And I think there's some human beings [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8458.66s)]
*  that find a very fulfilling life just reading books and traveling and experiencing different [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8465.460000000001s)]
*  things and seeing art and doing whatever the fuck they want to do. And they don't necessarily have [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8471.140000000001s)]
*  to have kids to live a fulfilling life that way. If they choose to do that with someone who they [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8475.94s)]
*  have a loving bond with and who they get married to. I don't think it's a bad thing that they don't [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8481.060000000001s)]
*  want to have kids. Well, I think I guess we have to maybe we're running into a question of of, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8486.42s)]
*  you know, now you get to the real fundamental question. I think it's a fundamental freedom [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8495.380000000001s)]
*  thing. We're not disagreeing, I guess, on the freedom aspect of it, because again, I'm not saying [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8498.980000000001s)]
*  that you should be required to have kids. You're imposing your sensibilities [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8504.98s)]
*  on what you think is important in life to other people. But everybody has a different idea of [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8509.14s)]
*  what's important without hurting anyone. The thing is, like, what I'm saying is these people that are [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8514.1s)]
*  that are married, that don't have children, they're not harming anyone. They're not harming these [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8519.38s)]
*  unborn children that they never have. They're not harming anyone. And it doesn't affect your [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8523.779999999999s)]
*  relationship with your family and your marriage at all. Yeah, but I'm also not I'm not imposing [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8529.22s)]
*  myself on them or harming them by answering a question about about how I feel about their [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8533.78s)]
*  choices. Right. But nor are gay people doing that to you. I think the harm comes from on a societal [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8540.18s)]
*  level. When we start breaking down these basic central institutions like the institution of the [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8547.300000000001s)]
*  family and marriage. That's where the harm comes from. And the more that people believe the more [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8556.66s)]
*  that we build a society where it's believed that marriage is objectively meaningless. Right. It's [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8561.7s)]
*  entirely subjective. It's just about it's just not making you feel better. The more that we build a [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8568.18s)]
*  society like that, I think that's where the harm comes in the worse it is. And people are going to [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8572.740000000002s)]
*  reject marriage. And and that means more, you know, fewer kids are being born. Also, more kids are [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8577.300000000001s)]
*  being born in a context where they don't have that stable family structure. So the harm definitely [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8583.54s)]
*  comes. It may not be this immediate, you know, connect the dots thing. But when we can already [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8587.7s)]
*  see that. So you think by adding gay couples to the definition of what a marriage is by defining [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8594.02s)]
*  it in that way, it's two people that bond each other. Somehow another that harms people that have [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8600.42s)]
*  successful marriages that are nuclear family marriages like you enjoy. I think it harms when [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8604.900000000001s)]
*  you say add them to the definition. You can't really add them to the definition. You can only [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8611.7s)]
*  just get rid of what the definition was. Well, that's your definition, though. The definition [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8617.22s)]
*  of marriage is just a legal bond. I mean, is it what is the definition? Like if we Google it today, [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8622.179999999998s)]
*  I'm sure it's been like politicized. Yeah. Right. Like what like Google marriage? What is the [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8627.939999999999s)]
*  definition of marriage today? I want that's that's an interesting question. Like how is that defined? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8633.22s)]
*  Because you know that most of these places that they do change them with culture, legally or [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8638.66s)]
*  formally recognize union of two people as partners in a personal relationship. Historically, [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8644.98s)]
*  in some jurisdictions, specifically a union between a man and a woman and in quotes a happy [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8650.98s)]
*  marriage, a combination or a mixture of two or more elements. OK, that's different marriage. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8656.58s)]
*  Yeah. Recognize union of two people. So what's the damage that gets done to a straight relationship [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8662.82s)]
*  if we change the definition of marriage and allow it to include gay couples? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8669.94s)]
*  By by by making marriage meaningless, that's that's the damage. Make it meaningless. It doesn't [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8677.140000000001s)]
*  make it meaningless. It doesn't change your marriage at all. It's just now gay people can [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8683.300000000001s)]
*  get married to like why? Why is I just I don't see that that even deteriorates the idea. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8688.26s)]
*  We're already seeing this on a societal level. We're seeing that people are rejecting marriage. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8694.980000000001s)]
*  They're saying that, you know, if people live together and they say, well, there's no point [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8699.14s)]
*  getting married because it's just it's all it is. That definition, it's just it's just utterly [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8703.3s)]
*  arbitrary, meaningless paperwork that says, yep, you're in a union and love each other. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8710.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, why would you need paperwork to codify the fact that you love each other? It's like [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8715.38s)]
*  it's a good question. Well, right. Exactly. That's my point. That's why that's why marriage [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8721.38s)]
*  can't be just that because if it's just that, then it's not anything. Well, maybe it is just that. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8725.699999999999s)]
*  And yet it's still rewarding for the people that participate in it because it is sort of silly that [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8731.38s)]
*  you bring in other people to codify your relationship and to like legally bind each other together. It is [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8736.5s)]
*  kind of crazy. Right. So I feel like in a weird way, we're agreeing because I'm saying that [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8743.46s)]
*  if we expand marriage to include gay couples, we have made marriage into something effectively [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8751.3s)]
*  meaningless and silly. And you're essentially saying that that's what it is. But that is that [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8757.3s)]
*  is the harm that I'm that I'm worried about. But I don't think gay people getting married [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8762.42s)]
*  changes that. I think if gay people didn't get married, you'd still have a bunch of people that [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8767.06s)]
*  think that marriage is silly and that marriage is just a legal bond and it's not necessary. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8772.019999999999s)]
*  And you can have a family without marriage. And there's a lot of people that do it. You'd have [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8777.22s)]
*  fewer. But the bigger point is that as a culture, we would not have affirmed and validated that [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8781.14s)]
*  view that marriage is silly and pointless. But as but now we have as a country, the Supreme Court [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8786.74s)]
*  validated it. So and that's a problem because I think that marriage is so important to a functioning [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8790.74s)]
*  human civilization, which is why there's we never there's never there's never been a civilization [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8800.26s)]
*  without it. And so we're you know, this is another one of those experiments that we're trying out. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8804.74s)]
*  I don't think it's going to work out too well. But it's dependent upon people agreeing to stay [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8810.82s)]
*  married. That's what it's dependent upon. And there's always that escape clause and people [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8815.06s)]
*  pull that shoot all the time. I don't think gay people being married has any effect on whether [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8819.539999999999s)]
*  or not straight people stay together or whether or not straight people get married or whether or not [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8826.18s)]
*  people appreciate marriage. They're staying married because there's a benefit to it. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8830.34s)]
*  It doesn't have anything to do with whether or not gay people are also married. I don't think [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8835.86s)]
*  that affects them in the slightest. I don't think my marriage is affected at all by my friend getting [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8840.34s)]
*  divorced. I think it has any effect on me. If I decide to stay married and my wife decides to stay [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8846.98s)]
*  married to me, that's our own decision. And we do it based on our own commitment to being together, [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8852.74s)]
*  to having a family, to raising a family. To other people getting married or not getting married or [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8858.5s)]
*  Elizabeth Taylor getting married 10 times means nothing. It has no effect on me. And it shouldn't. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8863.94s)]
*  Yeah, when you're looking at it on a real on the smallest, most individual level, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8870.42s)]
*  you could say that. And at least if there is if there is an effect, it's really hard to see. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8876.74s)]
*  But that's why you have to expand the view a little bit. Have you talked to happy gay couples [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8881.3s)]
*  and about what it means to them to be married? Because it's significant. It means like you think, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8885.14s)]
*  do you think people if they feel like they're is this a religious thing? Like, do you think the [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8891.3s)]
*  people who are gay should practice homosexuality? Or do you think that they should try to avoid it? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8897.46s)]
*  Because biblically, it's frowned upon. I am, I am a Christian, I'm Catholic. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8904.18s)]
*  Um, so if you want to talk about the biblical aspects of it, I can I can do that. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8910.74s)]
*  But what are your own personal feelings about like gay people? Should they avoid being gay? [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8916.58s)]
*  You know, I believe in sexual morality is that is that the sexual act properly ordered belongs [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8924.26s)]
*  within the marital bond, which should be reserved for a man and a woman. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8932.42s)]
*  Which also means that it's like sexually immortal have sex before marriage. All these things happen, [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8940.1s)]
*  I'm aware of that. But I do believe that it's it's immoral. But so that's we could talk about [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8945.22s)]
*  that part of the conversation. But then there's also the just the the definitional side of it, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8954.34s)]
*  which is what we've been talking about up till now. So I can I can I can explain as [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8961.54s)]
*  or you know, attempt to the the why the definition of marriage is important. [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8968.1s)]
*  I can do that without without, you know, saying, well, here's the Bible verse, quoting, right. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8973.7s)]
*  But obviously, there has to be some religious reason why you think it's immoral for people to [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8979.54s)]
*  have gay sex, for people to have sex with each other, even if they're married. Because like, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8985.460000000001s)]
*  if you think that extramarital relations are immoral, sexual relations are immoral, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8990.66s)]
*  what about gay people that preserve their virginity until they're married? There's people that are just [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=8996.74s)]
*  gay. They know they're gay. They've been gay forever. I have friends that are gay. They've [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9002.58s)]
*  always been gay. I have friends that are gay that are really damaged because they have to hide it. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9007.46s)]
*  And they're closeted. Some of them in the entertainment industry, some of them that are [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9012.34s)]
*  like alcoholics because of it, and they're all fucked up because they have this secret. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9016.1s)]
*  And they are gay. And it's not something that was forced upon them. It's not something that was [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9020.34s)]
*  asked of them or something they were manipulated into being. They're just gay. And if those gay [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9025.7s)]
*  people find other gay people and they fall in love, and they decide to get married, I don't see how [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9032.34s)]
*  that affects anyone other than someone that's not gay, who has this idea that they shouldn't be that [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9038.26s)]
*  way. But they're just gay. You're not going to fix that. And by telling them to ignore that aspect [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9045.62s)]
*  of who they are as a human being and to deny that that's always been a part of human history, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9051.94s)]
*  if you go back through like ancient stories, there's been men who've been in love with men. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9057.86s)]
*  It's always been the case. I mean, you said before, so you're saying [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9064.02s)]
*  two gay couples get married doesn't affect your marriage. Right. Just like you said that if [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9072.26s)]
*  you're afraid his divorce doesn't affect your marriage, which is probably basically true. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9075.7s)]
*  But the question is, when you have this happening on a massive societal scale, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9083.140000000001s)]
*  and you have a society that has embraced this and has officially embraced the idea that marriage is [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9090.02s)]
*  not permanent, so anyone just get divorced for whatever reason, marriage is not procreative, [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9097.060000000001s)]
*  so it doesn't matter, man, woman, just get married. That's where the effect comes in. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9101.78s)]
*  And yeah, as someone who's already been married as an adult, you might not feel it as much, [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9106.74s)]
*  but it certainly will. You said earlier that it's not going to stop other people from getting [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9112.66s)]
*  married. I think it does. I think actually it is. I think it will stop. I think it is right now. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9116.74s)]
*  Marriage rates are declining at a historic rate right now. I don't think it's a coincidence that [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9120.74s)]
*  that's happened and that this process has been sped up after the gay marriage Supreme Court [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9125.94s)]
*  decision and also alongside divorce being rampant. I think people are, they might not articulate it [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9131.86s)]
*  exactly like this. I mean, some of them probably would, but people are looking at marriage and [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9138.1s)]
*  they're seeing the way that it's treated now in society. And they're saying, it's just, [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9142.9s)]
*  I don't need it. If all it is is a piece of paperwork saying, I love this person, [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9147.78s)]
*  what the hell do I need that for? Like, why don't you, you know, [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9154.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but isn't that their own personal decision to make? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9156.82s)]
*  Like if we believe and value personal freedom, the freedom to choose your ideology, the freedom [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9160.82s)]
*  to live your life how you like to, the freedom to choose your occupation, the freedom to choose [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9165.3s)]
*  what education or discipline you pursue. Shouldn't we encourage the freedom to leave a relationship [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9171.06s)]
*  that's toxic? Like if someone is married and they're married to someone and they don't grow [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9180.1s)]
*  together and they grow apart from each other and they resent each other and hate each other, [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9186.1s)]
*  why should they stay together? Just because they said it? I mean, isn't that ridiculous to assume [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9189.78s)]
*  that people are not going to change? You're talking about people that get married for 10, [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9196.42s)]
*  15, 20 years. You're not the same person you were 20 years ago. I'm not the same person I was 20 [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9199.06s)]
*  years ago. If you're lucky, you marry someone and you grow together and your bond strengthens [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9204.42s)]
*  over time. But that doesn't always work. That's just part of being a human. Just because we have [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9209.7s)]
*  this institution that we've developed that we think that, oh, it should, until death do us part. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9214.740000000002s)]
*  Well, that's it. You said it forever. Now you're going to be miserable because in the eyes of God, [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9221.140000000001s)]
*  you have to be together forever and ever and ever. Amen. That's it. That seems ridiculous to me. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9225.78s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think that divorce should be just made illegal across the board. I do think it should [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9230.980000000001s)]
*  at least be made more difficult than it is in certain circumstances. Like this no fault [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9236.5s)]
*  divorce, just anyone for any reason. And I think that that has contributed to the divorce epidemic. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9242.42s)]
*  But isn't it an epidemic of people growing and changing? And people, they evolve over time. They [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9252.18s)]
*  devolve over time. They fall apart. People develop gambling habits and drug addictions. And [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9259.94s)]
*  the idea that marriage should be encouraged to be for life no matter what, it seems crazy. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9265.46s)]
*  I think it's an epidemic. You could phrase it that way. I think it's an epidemic of people, [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9272.9s)]
*  first of all, no, I wouldn't phrase it that way that it's an epidemic of people growing. I don't [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9278.1s)]
*  think that divorce is a- Growing apart. Yeah. I don't think that divorce is a product of personal [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9282.66s)]
*  growth. I think very often it's sort of the opposite of that. But- Sometimes it is though. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9287.62s)]
*  Sometimes one person personally grows and the other person falls apart. And you don't want to [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9291.86s)]
*  be bonded to them anymore. Yeah. But it's an epidemic of people not taking the marriage [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9296.18s)]
*  vows seriously. Of the marriage vows not really meaning anything. Because most people still, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9303.460000000001s)]
*  when they get married, even if they're not religious, most people still stand on an altar [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9307.62s)]
*  and the death do you part and they say all that. And so then, now we're saying, well, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9312.34s)]
*  those are just words. It doesn't actually mean anything. Does that mean something or not? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9319.779999999999s)]
*  I mean- Well, it does mean something, but it means something at the time and people do change. And [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9322.9s)]
*  I think you're coming at it from a perspective of a healthy user bias. You're in a good relationship. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9328.18s)]
*  You're in a good marriage. You're happy. Some people are not. Some people are in a marriage [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9332.26s)]
*  with someone who's abusive or someone who's stealing from them. There's a lot of reasons [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9336.5s)]
*  to get divorced. Yeah. But it's also not like a happy marriage is not something that you just [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9340.26s)]
*  fall into like a puddle. I mean, it's something- True, but a happy relationship kind of develops [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9347.539999999999s)]
*  in that way where the relationship is healthy and it's happy and you say, you know what? [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9351.859999999999s)]
*  I can do this for the rest of my life. Yeah. And the other person says, I can too. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9356.98s)]
*  It takes two to tango. Yeah. And marriage is something that you work on every day. And loving [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9360.9s)]
*  your spouse is not an emotional, it's not just emotions. It's not a feeling that you have about [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9367.38s)]
*  them. It's a choice that you make. Love is a choice to sacrifice and live in service to this [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9374.42s)]
*  other person. If both members of the couple do that, then the marriage will stay intact. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9380.26s)]
*  And my position is that that can be the case with gay people. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9387.460000000001s)]
*  And if one member of the couple is just unwilling to and is just gone, then there's only so much you [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9392.34s)]
*  can do to fight for it. So that's all the case. But what you're articulating is like, [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9398.02s)]
*  well, the marriage vows don't actually mean anything at all. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9406.66s)]
*  No, they mean something clearly because you have to get out of them. Like if you want to get out [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9409.380000000001s)]
*  of them, you have to go to court. They clearly mean something in our society and our culture. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9413.62s)]
*  They mean something financially, they mean something legally, they mean something emotionally, [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9418.34s)]
*  they mean something in terms of the definition of are you single or are you married? Are you a [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9422.58s)]
*  mister or a miss? They mean something. Yeah, but you said at the time. But it's something that [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9427.46s)]
*  we've created. We've invented this thing and we've ascribed meaning to it. But the reality is, [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9434.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, as much as we'd like to idealize about it, the divorce rate is extremely high. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9442.019999999999s)]
*  Even if it was 30%, that's pretty crazy. Yeah. I mean, I would say we've invented marriage in [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9446.98s)]
*  the same way that we've invented the family, which is that- No, there's always been a family. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9452.66s)]
*  That's my point. There's always been people raising children. And in fact, in tribal [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9457.7s)]
*  situations in the past, it was like a whole village would raise your kids. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9461.38s)]
*  We'd all raise children together. They would grow together. That's my point. I don't think of [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9465.14s)]
*  marriage, traditional marriage, quote unquote, as something that was invented per se. I think of it [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9469.14s)]
*  as something that exists. Men, women, man and woman creating a baby, living together. This exists. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9475.46s)]
*  It exists and we gave a name to it. Well, couples exist, but the idea of a legal bond [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9481.78s)]
*  and marriage most certainly is invented. Yeah, the paperwork and all that. There is the- [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9490.26s)]
*  And if that's not important, then marriage could be just something you say to each other. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9500.42s)]
*  The whole idea is that you're bringing it to court and there's legal reasons for that. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9506.18s)]
*  You get better insurance. You get to see your spouse when they're in the hospital. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9510.5s)]
*  There's all sorts of benefits to people being legally bound together. There's tax benefits. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9516.34s)]
*  There's a lot of benefits to that. And why should we give those benefits to someone, [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9521.86s)]
*  to a couple just because they love each other? Well, why should we give them to a couple that [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9527.06s)]
*  doesn't want to have children that are married? Well, we can give it to a couple that by its [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9531.54s)]
*  nature can create children. What if they can't? Should we exclude it from people that are infertile? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9539.38s)]
*  Well, but again, they still are partaking in the nature of marriage. And gay people aren't? [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9544.82s)]
*  If two gay people decide that they want to adopt children and they get bound together legally, [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9552.42s)]
*  isn't that the same thing? Let me just ask you this. Would you say that there is an important [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9558.82s)]
*  difference between a couple that can create a child, a couple who's, you know, [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9565.859999999999s)]
*  in the marital act, it can create a person versus a couple that fundamentally could never create a [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9573.22s)]
*  person? Well, that's the same thing as infertile people. Or people that have had their tues tied. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9580.9s)]
*  Well, fundamentally, once you have that operation, you are infertile. If once a woman has a [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9586.18s)]
*  hysterectomy, once a man, you know, gets fixed, you're infertile. So I'm not talking about an [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9591.54s)]
*  individual. I mean, the type of relationship or the type of coupling that by its nature can create [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9597.300000000001s)]
*  people versus the type of coupling that by its nature never can. I mean, is there a difference [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9604.740000000002s)]
*  between these two? Well, I think we even describe that difference differently. We call one of them [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9608.900000000001s)]
*  gay marriage. I mean, we literally have a name for it. That's your position. I'm saying, is it- [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9614.66s)]
*  But isn't that society's position in a lot of ways? Like, what percentage of our culture- [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9623.14s)]
*  We don't call it gay marriage. We just call it- Now we just call it marriage. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9628.18s)]
*  Yeah, but that's how it's referred to is like, we have to protect the rights for gay people to get [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9630.5s)]
*  married. We have to protect the rights for gay marriage. Right. But would you say- So you are [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9635.14s)]
*  saying that there is a difference between these two types of couples? Well, there's a difference [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9641.86s)]
*  between the human beings, clearly. There's a difference between gay people and straight people. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9647.460000000001s)]
*  Straight people can procreate through the act of sexual intercourse and gay people can't. Yeah. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9650.74s)]
*  But I don't think that's everything that a marriage is. But I think a marriage is a bond [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9656.82s)]
*  between people that love each other with all the aforementioned benefits, tax benefits, [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9661.54s)]
*  insurance benefits, the benefit to see each other when the loved one's sick. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9665.380000000001s)]
*  It's not everything that marriage is, but you are agreeing that it's a difference. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9669.46s)]
*  Yes. And it's an important difference because the ability to create people is a [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9674.18s)]
*  significant distinction. But my position is that that shouldn't be the only reason why people are [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9679.94s)]
*  allowed to get married. And my position also is that it seems that people are inherently gay. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9684.82s)]
*  There are people out there that are just gay. Do you think that those people that are just [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9691.62s)]
*  gay should not engage in gay activities? They should engage in gay sex and gay love? [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9696.18s)]
*  Yeah. I'm a Christian, so I believe in Christian sexual morality, which is that [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9702.9s)]
*  the sex belongs within the bonds of a marriage and marriage between a man and a woman. So [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9707.94s)]
*  that's what I believe. So you're opposed to all sex outside of marriage? [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9714.5s)]
*  Morally, yes. But yes, morally. Do you think that should be legal? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9719.94s)]
*  Well, should it be illegal to have sex outside of marriage? [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9725.619999999999s)]
*  Should that be a legal distinction? That sex is only legal while marrying? [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9728.18s)]
*  I would not support a law that bans sex outside of marriage. I mean, for one thing, it'd be [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9732.18s)]
*  impossible to enforce. I don't know. If I was like a dictator of the universe, [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9736.66s)]
*  and I could control everything, we could talk about it. But no, obviously you couldn't have a [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9743.46s)]
*  law like that. But even then, it goes against human nature. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9747.46s)]
*  But with the marriage discussion, we're not really talking about [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9750.26s)]
*  a law. It's not that before it was illegal for men to get married. It was that marriage just [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9756.1s)]
*  precluded two men partaking in it by definition. But wasn't it illegal? It wasn't legal for men [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9762.98s)]
*  to marry each other for a long time, or women to marry each other. That's the whole reason why [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9770.66s)]
*  they wanted equal marriage rights. Yeah, but it wasn't like you have a law in the books that says [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9777.06s)]
*  men can't do this. It's the law says, this is what this thing is, and that's it. This is what it is. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9782.26s)]
*  And if you are able to partake in it, then you can. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9790.66s)]
*  Well, there were legal restrictions that prevented them from doing it because one of them wasn't a [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9793.939999999999s)]
*  woman. Right? Right. So it's kind of a law preventing it. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9797.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I would say it's the same distinction as a man wants to use the women's restroom. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9801.78s)]
*  Is he being prevented by law from doing it? Well, it's just like, [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9811.140000000001s)]
*  you're not a woman. You're just not that. And so that's why it's not like there's a law [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9817.86s)]
*  targeting you individually. If the law prevents you from going into the women's restroom, [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9823.54s)]
*  it's not like this law is specifically targeting you. It's just that you're not that, [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9828.58s)]
*  and the law is protecting the privacy of the women in the restroom. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9834.02s)]
*  If you had a conversation with a gay man, and you were going to tell them what you thought [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9837.539999999999s)]
*  morally was correct to do, would you tell them not be gay? [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9843.14s)]
*  It certainly wouldn't be as simple as that. I don't think you'd just walk up to someone, [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9848.82s)]
*  tell them no. What would you give them as options? [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9851.7s)]
*  I mean, if you have that proclivity, it's not as simple as just someone to say you don't be that [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9853.94s)]
*  anymore. Right. So what would you tell them to do? [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9869.380000000001s)]
*  Just like if you want to stop premarital sex, it's not as simple to just say, don't do it. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9871.54s)]
*  And to actually live according to the sexual morality doctrines of the Christian faith, [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9878.82s)]
*  for example, is really difficult. But at least with premarital sex, they have the [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9886.5s)]
*  hope and the option to one day get married and engage in natural sex that they're attracted to. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9892.42s)]
*  What would you have gay people do? It's a difficult road, that's for sure. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9900.18s)]
*  So they should do nothing, they should have no sex ever. What if you have gay people [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9907.939999999999s)]
*  that meet other gay people, they love each other, they want to have sex, they should avoid that [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9913.38s)]
*  because of what? Because it's written somewhere? Because at one point in time, someone believes [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9919.22s)]
*  that God told them that they shouldn't have sex with other men? [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9925.22s)]
*  Now we're in the realm of a moral conversation. And that's my moral view. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9930.58s)]
*  Sex also has, we should be open to life. Sex has a procreative element. Again, doesn't mean every [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9937.46s)]
*  time you have sex you're going to create a baby. But that's an element of it that we should be open [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9946.179999999998s)]
*  to. And that's sex when it is properly ordered. What do you think is the cause of homosexuality, [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9952.66s)]
*  then? Because it's always existed. It's always existed even with healthy people, [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9959.22s)]
*  with healthy, balanced, happy people that are in love with other healthy, balanced, happy people [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9966.74s)]
*  that happen to be gay. Yeah. I think it's a multifaceted question. I don't know if we could [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9974.34s)]
*  point to one quote unquote cause. So I'm not exactly sure. I think that there is a societal [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9981.06s)]
*  element to it, especially in the formative years of a child. We are seeing the LGBT identification, [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=9989.86s)]
*  we talk about trans, but not just there. I mean, LGBT identification across the board is [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10000.26s)]
*  increasing exponentially. So that indicates to me that there's some sort of environmental, societal [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10005.86s)]
*  sort of element to it. But there's always been a certain percentage of the population that's gay. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10012.42s)]
*  So what would those people do? What would you have them do? This is where the rubber meets the [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10018.339999999998s)]
*  road when it comes to Christian ideology and enforcing or encouraging those belief systems [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10023.939999999999s)]
*  on other people that don't agree with them. Well, we're not talking about enforcing. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10030.98s)]
*  Well, okay. Encouraging or even discussing in a way that you disagree with it. Why would you care? [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10034.339999999998s)]
*  That's what I don't understand. If you want to live the Christian lifestyle and you want to be [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10039.3s)]
*  an obedient Christian, then sex happens within the confines of the marriage, [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10048.179999999998s)]
*  and marriage between man and woman. But do you think that that comes from God or do you think [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10057.06s)]
*  that comes from men? Do you think that that's human beings that have developed these [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10061.779999999999s)]
*  ideologies that they would like people to follow, these behavior patterns that they'd like people [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10067.3s)]
*  to follow? Or do you think it really comes from God? And if it really does come from God, why would [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10071.38s)]
*  God make people gay in the first place? Well, of course, I would say it comes from God. If [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10076.1s)]
*  I didn't believe that, then I wouldn't be Christian. Why would God make people gay [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10081.62s)]
*  if he didn't want them to engage in gay sex? All people have proclivities or [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10085.140000000001s)]
*  towards different sins, different things that we would call sins. Yeah, but if that's like [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10094.66s)]
*  their fundamental attractiveness, they're attracted fundamentally to other men, [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10099.7s)]
*  like or other women. Why? It seems like something that God gave them. Like, why would God give you [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10107.06s)]
*  an attractiveness? Why would you be attracted to the same sex if that was morally reprehensible, [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10116.34s)]
*  if that was against God's will? Why would he instill that lust and that desire and that [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10122.98s)]
*  feeling of being attracted and feeling of being in love with someone of the same sex? [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10131.460000000001s)]
*  I don't think instilled is not the word that I would use. I don't think God instills it. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10136.42s)]
*  I think that one of the, again, you want to get into the Christian doctrine. I mean, [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10140.82s)]
*  one of the basic elements of Christian doctrine is that we're a fallen species. And so there are many [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10146.9s)]
*  things that come out of our kind of fallen human nature. And we all have, like I said, we all have [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10155.86s)]
*  proclivities towards sin and no one's going to live a perfect life. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10163.699999999999s)]
*  To live a moral Christian life is really difficult. It requires a lot of sacrifice, [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10170.9s)]
*  no matter who you are. And that's it. I mean, it's... Have you wrestled with these thoughts [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10175.699999999999s)]
*  before? Have you had these kinds of conversations and really like... Sure, absolutely. Tried to [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10184.66s)]
*  figure out why. Why would God create gay people? Do you think that God has created gay people or [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10189.22s)]
*  do you think they have a choice? God has created all people. So every person that's gay was created [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10196.26s)]
*  by God, of course. Where exactly does that proclivity come from? Like I said, I don't know [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10202.26s)]
*  exactly. To say that someone's born gay, I have issues with that that go beyond theology, [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10208.98s)]
*  because now you're talking about... If you're born with a sexual... With any sexual proclivity, [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10218.74s)]
*  then that means that we're talking about gay infants and so on. Right. But don't you think [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10223.3s)]
*  people are born straight? That some people are born straight? Were you born straight? [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10228.42s)]
*  It's just... It's an odd way of talking about it. To say that a baby is heterosexual. I think babies [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10233.14s)]
*  don't have a sexuality in that sense. That's something that... Right. But eventually they [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10238.98s)]
*  will develop a sexuality and a small percentage of them will be homosexual. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10244.82s)]
*  And that's always been documented. It's natural. It's even natural in some animals. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10250.42s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, we started by talking about laws and what laws are put in place. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10258.66s)]
*  Now we're talking about Christian teaching. But don't you think that... Christianity has a... I [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10265.779999999999s)]
*  don't deny it. Christianity has a challenging sexual moral code. But we're also... I'm not [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10274.1s)]
*  suggesting that the Christian sexual morality should be codified into law. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10281.86s)]
*  But isn't that what's happening if that's how we define marriage? Because marriage is [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10291.86s)]
*  law. And if marriage shouldn't involve gay people, then you are saying that it's because [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10296.34s)]
*  of Christian fundamentalist ideology. No, because I think you can talk about the marriage issue [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10303.3s)]
*  without even getting into biblical morality, which is what I was doing. I mean, you brought [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10311.22s)]
*  up the Bible. Right. I didn't introduce it to... Well, I brought it up... We talked about Christianity [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10315.46s)]
*  in particular. Right. But that's my point. You introduced that to the conversation. Yes. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10319.779999999999s)]
*  Because I wanted to find the reason why you opposed gay people being married. [[02:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10326.66s)]
*  And I think I gave the reason, which is that marriage serves a certain purpose for society. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10332.82s)]
*  It is a certain thing definitionally. And it is, as you even agreed, the union between a man and [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10337.94s)]
*  a woman in principle is different from the union between a man and a man or a woman and a woman. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10345.54s)]
*  And that difference comes down to its capacity, its procreative capacity or lack thereof. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10351.94s)]
*  So we're in agreement that there's a difference there. I would say that it's an important [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10358.42s)]
*  distinction. And so it makes sense for society to have a certain name for this procreative union. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10361.06s)]
*  But should we have a different name for people that have zero desire to procreate, [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10373.46s)]
*  but are also heterosexual, they want to be married? [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10377.779999999999s)]
*  No. I mean, no. Then why should we have a different name for gay people that are in love, [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10384.18s)]
*  that want to be married? Because the union between a man and a woman, even if they choose [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10390.26s)]
*  not to have kids, it is still a fundamentally procreative union apart from choices they make [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10395.54s)]
*  or if someone has a condition where they're not able to conceive. Even in those cases, [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10403.54s)]
*  I think we're still called to a kind of parental service, but maybe in a different form. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10408.98s)]
*  You mentioned before charity work, something like that. People that can't have kids, [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10418.34s)]
*  that could be a form of paternal or maternal service. I think that most people are called [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10425.380000000001s)]
*  to have kids and raise families that way, but not everybody. But I think everyone is called to [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10433.86s)]
*  a life of paternal and maternal service. Because the other option is a life that centers around [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10441.22s)]
*  the individual, around yourself. I don't think that's a path to happiness or fulfillment for [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10450.5s)]
*  anybody in the long run. I think someone is on their deathbed and they're dying and you ask them [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10455.46s)]
*  what their regrets are. There's not very many people that on their deathbed are going to tell [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10467.3s)]
*  you they regret that they had kids or that they gave their life to their kids. A lot of people, [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10470.02s)]
*  as they get older, say they regret not having them. Sure, but you don't believe it should be [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10473.7s)]
*  a requirement, right? No, not a legal requirement. Of course not. Even a moral requirement. You think [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10479.7s)]
*  it should be a moral requirement for people? What do you mean should be a moral requirement? [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10486.42s)]
*  You should think of it that way. You have a moral obligation to procreate. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10491.62s)]
*  I think you have a moral obligation in your marriage to keep your marriage open to its capacity for [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10496.98s)]
*  life. But I wouldn't put the state in charge of enforcing that. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10507.7s)]
*  Clearly. But we do involve the state in our relationships, which is very strange. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10515.78s)]
*  That's what I think when people make this sort of logical assessment of what a marriage really is. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10520.58s)]
*  That's when they start thinking it's silly. Because you're involving people that really [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10525.3s)]
*  don't give a shit about you and you begin a part of a machine. It's a financial machine. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10529.859999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of money involved in marriages and divorce. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10534.98s)]
*  Yeah, there are even conservatives now who will say, well, just get government and marriage [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10538.42s)]
*  completely. Just the whole thing. Just get it out. I can understand that view, especially at [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10542.34s)]
*  this point, just saying it's caused more problems than it's worth and all that kind of stuff. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10549.939999999999s)]
*  But I don't agree with it because I think that there was a reason why the government recognized [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10554.74s)]
*  marriage in the past because it has this really significant consequential capacity. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10562.26s)]
*  Society has a vested interest in your marriage if it has the potential to be procreative. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10571.86s)]
*  Because you're creating people. The rest of us are going to have to deal with those people [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10580.5s)]
*  that you create. So I think ideally, that's what I would still like to see. I still think that [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10583.7s)]
*  society and the government should recognize that. So what do you think they should do about gay marriage? [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10590.900000000001s)]
*  I think it's not going to happen. But if it were up to me, I would go back to what it was [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10601.460000000001s)]
*  six, seven years ago, where marriage is definitionally this one thing and that's it. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10608.58s)]
*  And as you say- [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10617.7s)]
*  Gay people, what should they be allowed to do? Civil unions? [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10619.7s)]
*  Well, it's not about a lot. I mean, if- [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10623.380000000001s)]
*  But that is kind of what it's about if we're talking about laws, if we're talking about [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10625.380000000001s)]
*  definitions, we're talking about how society accepts and whether or not you get the insurance [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10628.42s)]
*  benefits and the tax benefits of a heterosexual couple, whether you can visit your spouse [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10636.099999999999s)]
*  when they're in the hospital. Those are significant things for gay couples. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10640.74s)]
*  But again, I wouldn't say that it's that, you know, it's well, we're not allowing gay people [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10651.06s)]
*  to get married. It's that marriage is this. This is what it is. This is what it's for. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10654.9s)]
*  And that's it. That's the definition of it. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10661.619999999999s)]
*  And there should be no similar option for gay people? [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10666.02s)]
*  Well, if you are with someone and you love them, I mean, there's, you know, [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10669.94s)]
*  like you've been saying this whole time, it seems almost silly that you need to have paperwork to [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10674.82s)]
*  affirm that. Like there was no one was ever suggesting a law that would say you're only [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10682.5s)]
*  allowed to love people in marriage. You know, if you're not married, you're not allowed to [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10689.22s)]
*  love people. No one's suggesting that. I just don't with this current idea of marriage. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10692.42s)]
*  I don't even see the point of it, if that's all it is. If all I still go back to, [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10704.099999999999s)]
*  why would you even? I know the purpose of marriage and why society had an interest in it, [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10709.3s)]
*  if it's fundamentally procreative. But if it's not, and we're just getting rid of that, then, [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10715.539999999999s)]
*  and all it is this paperwork to say, I love someone and not even permanently, [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10720.66s)]
*  because I might not love them tomorrow. You know, it's just, it's like you turn, [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10724.82s)]
*  it's turned into sort of a charade, which is what, which is what many people think marriage is, [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10728.18s)]
*  essentially. And, and that's kind of what I'm, that's what I'm worried about, you know, [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10732.98s)]
*  because one way or another, we, I don't know, you fast forward 20 or 30 years [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10738.34s)]
*  and marriage rates have continued their decline. And we, maybe 30 years from now, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10744.42s)]
*  there's like almost no marriage at all. What does society look like? I don't know exactly, [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10748.34s)]
*  but I don't think it looks better. I don't see that as an improvement. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10752.74s)]
*  And you think somehow or another that allowing gay people to get married contributes to that [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10756.02s)]
*  decline? I think it contributes to the idea that marriage is essentially meaningless. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10761.06s)]
*  And so, yeah. But it's meaningful to those people. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10770.34s)]
*  Right. But it has no, it has no objective or real significant meaning outside of like, [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10774.98s)]
*  other than the ones we discussed about taxes and visit your spouse and affirming your love together [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10778.82s)]
*  in what you feel like is a permanent way. You're making a bond. You're making a pact [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10786.18s)]
*  with this other person that you love. Yeah. It affirms how someone feels in the moment. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10791.460000000001s)]
*  It makes them feel good. But as you said, it might not tomorrow. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10797.86s)]
*  Right. But what bothers people is that religious ideology will be imposed upon them [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10800.74s)]
*  in that sense. And that the only reason why people would oppose it [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10808.34s)]
*  in a different way than they're opposing heterosexual people that have no intention [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10812.58s)]
*  of having children is because they have an opposition to homosexuality based on religious [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10816.26s)]
*  beliefs, which they feel like should be excluded. And I feel like should be excluded from law. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10822.26s)]
*  Yeah. But I don't think that the question of the definition of marriage is a question of religious [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10828.02s)]
*  ideology. The question of Christian sexual morality and what is, you know, that sort of thing, [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10832.900000000001s)]
*  that is a religious question. Yeah. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10840.1s)]
*  Definition of marriage isn't, I don't think it's not merely that or not only that anyway. [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10843.7s)]
*  And one of the ways that I know that is that marriage has existed as an institution [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10849.300000000001s)]
*  in societies all across the country and throughout history. And regardless of what [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10853.86s)]
*  religion was predominant in those societies. So, you know, I don't think Christians like [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10858.900000000001s)]
*  just invented this idea that marriage is between a man and a woman. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10867.380000000001s)]
*  Because if they did, then you wouldn't find it anywhere else. [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10872.74s)]
*  Have other cultures embraced gay marriage in the past? [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10874.980000000001s)]
*  Certainly today, it's gaining wide approval. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10878.019999999999s)]
*  Is that something in the past that people embraced while they embraced heterosexual marriages? [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10880.5s)]
*  Is it a cultural thing? [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10885.14s)]
*  I don't think so. I mean, I'm not aware of any historical precedent going back in history to a [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10887.06s)]
*  culture that would affirm, you know, two men as being married in the same sense that a man and [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10893.699999999999s)]
*  woman are married. I'm not aware of that existing in history. I don't think that it did. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10899.539999999999s)]
*  Certainly it was not common if it did. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10904.26s)]
*  When Roe v. Wade was overturned, that was the next thing that people were worried about. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10906.9s)]
*  They were worried about gay marriage being overturned. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10911.94s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen. There's no political will for it. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10916.5s)]
*  Everything that I'm saying here, you know, you don't see Republican politicians out on [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10924.82s)]
*  the campaign trail saying it. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10929.300000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10930.34s)]
*  You don't see Republican politicians out on the campaign trail saying it. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10931.38s)]
*  It's not going to happen. Then again, I didn't think Roe v. Wade was going to be overturned, [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10935.619999999999s)]
*  and it was, but this is a different sort of thing. I don't see that on the horizon. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10941.3s)]
*  I think this conversation that we're having, one of the more important things of being able [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10949.14s)]
*  to have conversations like this is that people that do have differing perspectives can have a [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10953.14s)]
*  civil conversation on why they believe what they believe. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10958.66s)]
*  This is so sadly uncommon in our culture, and there's going to be people out there that agree [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10962.98s)]
*  with you that are listening to this that are like, I am on Matt Walsh's side, and there's going to [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10970.5s)]
*  be people that see my point, but that's part of being a person. The part of being a human being [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10975.46s)]
*  that exists in 2022 is there's a lot of different ways to live your life and a lot of different [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10981.14s)]
*  ways to see the world. Whether or not you and I ever come to an agreement about this, it's not [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10986.9s)]
*  really that important. What's important is that you get a chance to discuss it. That is what scares [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10992.42s)]
*  the shit out of me about our culture today, that these kinds of conversations are not encouraged, [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=10998.98s)]
*  they're discouraged, and that some would say, oh, you're platforming a bigot to have this [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11003.539999999999s)]
*  conversation. You're putting those ideas out there. I think that's what one of the things that's led [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11008.34s)]
*  us into this fucking mess we're in right now. One of the reasons that we can have a civil [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11015.86s)]
*  conversation is that we still, even though we differ widely on really important issues, [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11020.1s)]
*  there's a commonality. We started the conversation talking about gender, so we can agree there's [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11028.82s)]
*  basic biological reality. Well, we have a lot in common. We're both married, we both have children. [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11032.58s)]
*  So there's the commonality there too that I think makes the conversation possible. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11039.62s)]
*  We both agree in civil discourse and be able to express yourself articulately and [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11044.9s)]
*  express your thoughts, allowing that person to express their thoughts. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11051.3s)]
*  But then one of the problems is if I'm sitting across the table from someone who doesn't even [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11055.779999999999s)]
*  believe any of those things, then we might be able to refrain from shouting at each other, but [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11060.34s)]
*  to have any kind of productive conversation at all is really impossible because there's [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11069.699999999999s)]
*  just no shared framework at all. Maybe, but at least people like in the movie, in What is a Woman, [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11074.9s)]
*  you at least let those people explain themselves and you made it clear where you stand. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11085.14s)]
*  People get a chance to assess these ideas for their merits by themselves, [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11093.38s)]
*  which is that's what I think is important about a documentary like yours, not just exposing these [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11100.58s)]
*  horrific practices of doing these things to children before they can even have any idea what [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11106.5s)]
*  the consequences are, but also that you let people know that the ideological bubble that you're [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11111.7s)]
*  living in is not the only way to see the world. There's a lot of people out there that disagree, [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11120.58s)]
*  there's a lot of people out there that disagree, and they have opinions and a lot of them are very [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11125.3s)]
*  intelligent as well, and we should hear them. If you're confident in your own viewpoints, [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11129.939999999999s)]
*  then you shouldn't be threatened by allowing people to speak. I think there's a lot of people [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11135.699999999999s)]
*  that are just not really all that confident in what they believe, and so they're afraid to let [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11141.619999999999s)]
*  other people speak. Maybe because at some level too, they're afraid that they'll be, if not, [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11146.099999999999s)]
*  exposed intellectually. Maybe they're even afraid that they'll be convinced they don't want to be [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11154.18s)]
*  convinced. Maybe. I think they just don't want to lose. I think people, a lot of times, they [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11156.98s)]
*  equate their ideas and their positions on things to them as a human, to them as an entity, and [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11163.54s)]
*  anything that opposes things that they've agreed to or believe in or ascribed, they think of that [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11171.06s)]
*  as being an assault on their very being. Yeah, they do. It's a stupid way to think. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11179.46s)]
*  Assault on their being and somehow a danger to them, even physically. Even violence. Those ideas [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11184.82s)]
*  are violence, and they cause harm to people. Yeah, and if you're defining yourself too by your own, [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11193.699999999999s)]
*  we put people's self-perception above everything. We have to affirm someone's self-perception, [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11201.06s)]
*  and no matter what, well then if someone says something that makes a person question their [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11206.74s)]
*  own self-perception, it's almost like it's an act of murder. You're killing their self-perception, [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11212.74s)]
*  and they can respond to it that way. It's an actual act of violence. That's why they say [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11218.9s)]
*  misgendering is a violent act. How could that possibly be justified? Well, it's a violent act [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11223.94s)]
*  because it's an assault on not them physically, but on what they consider more important, which [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11228.980000000001s)]
*  is their idea of themselves. Right. Which is why silencing people is what they're trying to, like [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11234.1s)]
*  yelling at that person who is a transition or detransitioner, calling them a fascist. [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11240.26s)]
*  You can just minimize everything that they stand for instantaneously with one word or with one [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11246.98s)]
*  phrase. Yeah. Well listen, Matt, I enjoyed talking to you. We disagree about a lot, but I get your [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11252.5s)]
*  perspective, and I think your movie is very important. It is eye-opening. I think a lot of [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11260.98s)]
*  parents should watch it. A lot of people that are in that liberal ideological bubble, I would [[03:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11268.42s)]
*  encourage them to watch it and see what they're up against, because I don't think it's everything [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11273.939999999999s)]
*  they think that it is. I don't think it's what you're getting described to you by John Stewart [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11278.26s)]
*  and John Oliver and any of these left-wing talking heads that are on these media platforms that seem [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11283.14s)]
*  universally to be accepting these ideas wholesale. And I'm glad you made it. Yeah, I appreciate it. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11290.5s)]
*  Again, thanks for talking about the film. And I hope people just give it a chance. Don't make an [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11297.7s)]
*  assumption about what you think the movie is. Just watch it and see if it speaks to you. Go bootleg [[03:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11304.42s)]
*  it. It's available everywhere. It's on YouTube. Go to dailywire.com. Is there a website specifically [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11310.66s)]
*  for the documentary? Yeah, whatiswoman.com. Okay, all right. Thanks, Matt. Thanks. Thank you. All right, bye everybody. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZXLphZAdo&t=11317.62s)]
