# Joe Rogan Experience #2005 - Tom Segura
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6.0s)]
*  Yeehaw. What's up, Tommy Pons? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=12.0s)]
*  What's up, my man? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=14.0s)]
*  How are you, my brother? What's cracking? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=15.0s)]
*  I'm super stoked, man. Thanks for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=16.0s)]
*  Looking good, looking lean. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=18.0s)]
*  You fucking stuck with it, man. You fucking stuck with it. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=20.0s)]
*  Tried to. Yeah, I've been working hard at it, actually. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=24.0s)]
*  You're crazy. I mean, you've been so consistent. It's amazing. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=27.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird how that works? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=30.0s)]
*  That's what I've said to a few people, and they're like, yeah, that's what happens. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=33.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. I just keep... I think I had this... [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=39.0s)]
*  I don't know if I told you, like, this mentality before, where I would go, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=43.0s)]
*  if I got to a number on the scale, I thought of it as like a finish line. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=47.0s)]
*  I didn't realize I was doing it, but I was. I was going, oh, I got there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=53.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=55.0s)]
*  And then you just kind of go, well, if you're done, you're done. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=59.0s)]
*  And then you just kind of regress. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=60.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=62.0s)]
*  So I just realize now that it's just... it is every day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=63.0s)]
*  It is life. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=67.0s)]
*  It's life. It's part of life, yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=68.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you can think about it that way. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=69.0s)]
*  Also, you've got to think about it like delayed gratitude. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=71.0s)]
*  Delayed gratitude is a very important concept if you want to have a happy life. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=75.0s)]
*  You can't just have gratitude in front of your face all the time. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=78.0s)]
*  No. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=81.0s)]
*  You'll just be a mess. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=82.0s)]
*  You want delayed gratitude, and specifically for your physical health, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=83.0s)]
*  because you don't feel good in the end of the day. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=87.0s)]
*  Like, unless you've... when I don't work out, if I have a day that I blow it off, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=89.0s)]
*  which is rare, but it does happen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=94.0s)]
*  If I blow it off, at the end of the day, I feel like a loser. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=95.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=97.0s)]
*  I know that's stupid. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=98.0s)]
*  I know it's stupid, but it's that feeling inside of you that you didn't get ahead. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=99.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=103.0s)]
*  You didn't... it's one thing if it's like I need a rest day. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=104.0s)]
*  Rest days, I love them. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=107.0s)]
*  Let me watch TV, I'll watch a movie. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=109.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=111.0s)]
*  You've got to listen to your body on that, for sure. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=112.0s)]
*  And also your mind. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=115.0s)]
*  I think your mind needs rest days. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=116.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=117.0s)]
*  I enjoy a rest day now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=118.0s)]
*  Really, I fucking... but if you don't do the things you know you're supposed to do, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=119.0s)]
*  you have that fucking nagging thing in your head. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=126.0s)]
*  And that thing in your head, that nagging thing, that's hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of your day. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=133.0s)]
*  Whereas the workout, you could just get 20 minutes in, and that feeling's gone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=134.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=138.0s)]
*  Just get 20 minutes in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=139.0s)]
*  There's the... I feel like a loser thing that also... but there's also this even another layer to it, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=140.0s)]
*  where on days when I don't do anything physical, and it's towards the end of the day, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=147.0s)]
*  I kind of go like, what's wrong with me? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=153.0s)]
*  And Christina might be like, what's going on with you? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=156.0s)]
*  And then sometimes it takes me a moment and I'll be like, I didn't work out today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=160.0s)]
*  Yep. That's what it is. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=164.0s)]
*  Oh, I go, yeah, so I have this... [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=165.0s)]
*  Mental health. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fucking with my head. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=168.0s)]
*  I also have this... the anxiety has manifested itself physically, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=169.0s)]
*  so I just have this like, oh, I didn't exert myself. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=174.0s)]
*  So it's all together. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=178.0s)]
*  And I go, that's what it is. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=180.0s)]
*  So I go, tomorrow morning I just got to get it in right away. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=182.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just one of those things like brushing your teeth. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=185.0s)]
*  You got to fucking do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=187.0s)]
*  You don't want to do it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=188.0s)]
*  You do it, then you feel better afterwards. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=189.0s)]
*  In little bursts of that's how I feel every time I get in that stupid cold plunge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=191.0s)]
*  Every time I want to do it, every time I do it, I don't want to do it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=195.0s)]
*  It always sucks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=197.0s)]
*  It sucks. It never feels good. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=198.0s)]
*  We had this thing where we were doing... [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=200.0s)]
*  We had to bank episodes of our podcasts, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=202.0s)]
*  so that means we were going into the studio at like, I don't know, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=205.0s)]
*  nine or ten and then just spending the day there, right? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=209.0s)]
*  And I knew that when I got home, I'd be wiped. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=212.0s)]
*  And we got, you know, we were with the kids [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=215.0s)]
*  and we got to do dinner and get them ready for it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=217.0s)]
*  So I was like, I'm just going to get up. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=219.0s)]
*  And so every day I just got up a little earlier, cold plunge first. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=221.0s)]
*  So it's like that was my morning cough. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=227.0s)]
*  It was the first thing I did. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=229.0s)]
*  Makes you right the fuck up. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=230.0s)]
*  Right the fuck up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=231.0s)]
*  And then right to the gym. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=232.0s)]
*  And so that I would arrive at the studio in the best mood. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=234.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=238.0s)]
*  Just like really in a great mood. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=240.0s)]
*  And then I would zip through the day and I mean, even they were like, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=241.0s)]
*  wow, you're like nice. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=243.0s)]
*  You know, like the staff. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=245.0s)]
*  Dude, it's like if you could take that in a pill form, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=248.0s)]
*  it would be the most popular pill in the world. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=251.0s)]
*  100%. No question. Yeah. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=253.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=255.0s)]
*  And we're not talking about like being a bodybuilder. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=256.0s)]
*  We're not talking about killing it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=258.0s)]
*  No. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=259.0s)]
*  Just getting your heart pumping, getting your sweat going, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=260.0s)]
*  get those muscles moving, exert yourself. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=267.0s)]
*  I can get a fucking pretty good workout in 20 minutes. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=268.0s)]
*  You can definitely get your heart going. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=273.0s)]
*  If I'm fucking super pressed for time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=274.0s)]
*  You know what's crazy is if you, when I work out right after cold plunging, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=276.0s)]
*  sometimes you're like, wait, how come I'm not sweating? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=280.0s)]
*  You don't realize that your core temperature has dropped like 17 degrees. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=282.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=285.0s)]
*  You're in 34 degrees in three minutes. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=289.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=290.0s)]
*  I work out outside after I do that. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=291.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=294.0s)]
*  So I do my, I do the series of 100 bodyweight squats and 100 pushups every morning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=295.0s)]
*  And the way I do it is I do it as my warmup now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=299.0s)]
*  It's a good warmup to do right after you get out of the cold plunge. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=301.0s)]
*  So by the time I'm done with those, I'm warmed up. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=304.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=307.0s)]
*  But it's nice to do outside. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=308.0s)]
*  Yeah, that is cool. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=309.0s)]
*  That's one of the only times that I really don't mind heat, like real heat, is during workouts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=310.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=316.0s)]
*  I like working out in heat. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=317.0s)]
*  It's good for you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=318.0s)]
*  I do not like a cold gym. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=319.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=321.0s)]
*  When the air condition is blasting in a gym. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=322.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=323.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=324.0s)]
*  No, I don't like that either. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=325.0s)]
*  I like, you know, Cronk Gym where Tommy Hearns used to train, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=326.0s)]
*  they always kept the temperature very high. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=330.0s)]
*  They did? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=332.0s)]
*  Yeah, they kept it like 95 degrees. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=333.0s)]
*  Yeah, in Detroit. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=334.0s)]
*  And the reason, well, Manuel Stewart was a genius, a boxing genius. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=336.0s)]
*  But also a genius physically. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=339.0s)]
*  He knew it's just like working out in a sauna. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=340.0s)]
*  Like the sauna actually gives you cardiovascular benefit just sitting there because your heart's beating faster [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=342.0s)]
*  because it's trying to, body's trying to cool you off. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=347.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=349.0s)]
*  You're hot as fuck. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=350.0s)]
*  You know, I've had the heart strap on in the sauna and got up to 147 degrees. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=351.0s)]
*  Or excuse me, 147 beats per minute. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=356.0s)]
*  Just sitting there. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, just sitting there. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=360.0s)]
*  Yeah, your body's like, what's happening? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=362.0s)]
*  Especially because you do it in after a workout. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=363.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=364.0s)]
*  So I'm already fucking exhausted. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=365.0s)]
*  And then I get in that oven for 20 minutes. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=367.0s)]
*  And at the end of that 20 minutes, my heart is jacked. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=369.0s)]
*  So it's all, you're getting static cardio just sitting there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=371.0s)]
*  Just sitting there. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=374.0s)]
*  So if you're doing a boxing workout and it's 95 degrees, your heart is jacked. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=375.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=379.0s)]
*  You're getting, you're getting really worked out. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=380.0s)]
*  That's hard. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=381.0s)]
*  It's like running with weights on. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=382.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=383.0s)]
*  And then imagine that feeling right after that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=384.0s)]
*  Like when you're done. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=386.0s)]
*  The relief. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=387.0s)]
*  Like a hot yoga class. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=388.0s)]
*  Remember when we were doing hot yoga? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=389.0s)]
*  We had to do, how many did we do? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=390.0s)]
*  15 in a month. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=392.0s)]
*  We did 15. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=393.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=394.0s)]
*  That was nice, dude. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=395.0s)]
*  That was nice. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=396.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=397.0s)]
*  Something about leaving those. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=398.0s)]
*  I went to one here in Austin. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=402.0s)]
*  I went to a hot yoga class and it was like, you just walk outside. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=403.0s)]
*  You're like, this isn't any different. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=405.0s)]
*  This is the exact same temperature. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=407.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=409.0s)]
*  It's just yoga with no AC on. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=410.0s)]
*  God. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=411.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=412.0s)]
*  But it did, you do feel this. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=413.0s)]
*  And then that, the way that like a cold drink tastes right after that. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=414.0s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=419.0s)]
*  Just water. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=420.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=421.0s)]
*  Just water. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=422.0s)]
*  Just the cold water is so good. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=424.0s)]
*  It just feels so good. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=425.0s)]
*  Do you take electrolytes? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=426.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=427.0s)]
*  Every day. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=428.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=429.0s)]
*  I travel with the packets and everything. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=430.0s)]
*  Which ones you taking? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=431.0s)]
*  I have liquid IV. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=432.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=433.0s)]
*  I take those pouches with me everywhere. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=435.0s)]
*  I take those too. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=436.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=437.0s)]
*  And I also take them, I have a big one before bed. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=438.0s)]
*  I fill up like a big canteen. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=439.56s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=440.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=441.56s)]
*  Do you have to get up to piss in the middle of the night? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=442.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=443.56s)]
*  It's annoying. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=444.56s)]
*  It's annoying. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=445.56s)]
*  Not too, too much. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=446.56s)]
*  I mean, I don't do it like right before bed, but like I have an evening one because I remembered [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=447.56s)]
*  even from like high school football in Florida that they would go, if you're cramping, it's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=450.84s)]
*  too late to start. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=458.28s)]
*  Like you start taking, it's not going to help you then. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=459.28s)]
*  It's all about like the prep for it. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=462.11999999999995s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  So like you, that day before you exert yourself electrolyte boost is what's going to help [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  you more. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=469.65999999999997s)]
*  You know? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=470.65999999999997s)]
*  So I was trying to do it like at night too. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=473.23999999999995s)]
*  Just keeping a steady state in your body. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=474.23999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=476.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=477.84s)]
*  It should be something that you take every day. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=478.84s)]
*  I think, dude, like I never, I never hated, I wasn't one of those people who was like, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=479.84s)]
*  I hate the gym or I hate working out. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=483.0s)]
*  It really is being consistent with food too. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=485.4s)]
*  That's a big thing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=488.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=489.08s)]
*  Like I didn't realize how much I, well, I knew I was eating poorly a lot. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=490.08s)]
*  I was just like, I had no sense of like portion control. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  What turned it around? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=499.67999999999995s)]
*  Was it those contests? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=500.67999999999995s)]
*  Was it the weight loss contest? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=501.67999999999995s)]
*  I guess it's a little bit of everything. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=502.82s)]
*  I think actually getting severely injured and like just being like, first of all, I [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=504.66s)]
*  think hearing people being like, oh, you're really going to fall apart now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=512.4200000000001s)]
*  Like now that you're, you've been injured, you're going to be a mess. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=515.3000000000001s)]
*  You're going to gain like a hundred pounds. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=518.5400000000001s)]
*  Like people would say that. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=520.82s)]
*  Who said that to you, Bert? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=521.82s)]
*  Actually his wife. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=522.82s)]
*  His wife said that to you? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=523.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=524.82s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=525.82s)]
*  But she was just like in the moment saying it, but no, she wasn't even going to. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=526.82s)]
*  You're going to gain a hundred pounds. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=531.82s)]
*  She was like, you're going to gain real fat. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=532.82s)]
*  You're going to be fatter than my husband. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=534.5s)]
*  We're going to make fun of you. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=535.5s)]
*  I was like, that's impossible. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=536.5s)]
*  But it wasn't even just that, you know, it was like other people too. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=537.5s)]
*  Other people were like, oh yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=543.14s)]
*  I mean, I would see it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=544.46s)]
*  Like when I open up Twitter or something, they're like, this dude's about to be a fucking [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=545.46s)]
*  whale. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=549.86s)]

*  know? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=554.9s)]
*  So I think that kind of started it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=555.9s)]
*  And then what happened was my PT was, you know, we were doing all the rehab stuff and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=557.34s)]
*  She was the one who was like, are people telling you you're going to like get like way out [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=563.42s)]

*  She goes, yeah. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  She goes, you know, it's going to be the opposite, right? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=569.6999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=570.6999999999999s)]
*  She was, you're going to be in like the best shape of your life. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=571.6999999999999s)]
*  And I was like, why? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=572.6999999999999s)]
*  She's like, cause you're going to be so focused on rehab and you're going to feel better doing [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=573.6999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=579.1s)]
*  And you're just going to want to get like, she was the one who, Dr. Karen Joubert. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=580.1s)]
*  So we have to break Bert's arm. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=583.9s)]
*  We have to break multiple limbs. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=585.54s)]
*  We got to fuck him. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=587.54s)]
*  We should hit him with a bus. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=590.54s)]
*  You know, do you remember the moment of reflection after this last sober October? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=591.9399999999999s)]

*  We were all going to go do a show. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=596.66s)]
*  And I said, come do the show with us. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=597.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=599.66s)]
*  And Bert was like, I can't go out. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=600.66s)]
*  If I go out, I'm going to drink and I don't want to drink. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=601.66s)]
*  I'm really going to get my shit together now. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=603.9399999999999s)]
*  No, no, I don't actually. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=605.5799999999999s)]
*  Where were we? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=607.86s)]
*  You might not have been there. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=608.86s)]
*  You might not have been why he was saying it. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=609.86s)]
*  We were right out in front. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=610.86s)]
*  Oh, cause I left a few minutes before. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=611.86s)]
*  Remember? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=613.66s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=614.66s)]
*  I was like, I got to go put the kids down. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=615.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=616.66s)]
*  I was trying to get them to come to the show with us and he didn't want to do it. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=617.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=620.14s)]
*  He just likes the party. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=621.74s)]
*  Hey, the party's great. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=622.74s)]
*  But I think he partied during October when we had sober October and I still think he [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=624.5s)]
*  had a great fucking time. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=629.14s)]
*  I saw his shows. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=630.5s)]
*  It was like he was killing it. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=631.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=633.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=634.5s)]
*  It doesn't make it more of a party to get fucked up every night. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=635.5s)]
*  It's just unsustainable. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=640.74s)]
*  That's what I worry about. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=643.8199999999999s)]
*  You know, when we first did the sober October thing, that was part of the discussion. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=644.8199999999999s)]
*  We were all like, hey, Burt drinks too much. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=650.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=654.18s)]
*  Like, what's, and I smoke too much weed. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=655.18s)]
*  Let's try to work this out. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=656.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=658.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=659.66s)]
*  Turns out smoking too much weed is like way better for you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=660.66s)]
*  I think it is. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=663.5s)]
*  He's on a bender right now too. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=664.5s)]
*  On this tour he's on. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=666.98s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=668.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=669.46s)]
*  He looks like a moon pie. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=670.46s)]
*  A moon pie with a beard. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=671.46s)]
*  He's so swollen. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=674.46s)]
*  He's so swollen. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=675.46s)]
*  This reminds me of that Joey Diaz line where I go, you seen Bertie goes, oh, he's so fat [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=676.9000000000001s)]
*  I thought he was a Chinese guy. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=681.9000000000001s)]
*  He's having a good time though. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=682.9000000000001s)]
*  He is having a good time. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=686.7s)]
*  I'm very happy for him too. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=687.7s)]
*  I'm happy for the movie and these arenas. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=688.7s)]
*  That festival is a huge success. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=692.08s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=694.02s)]
*  Watching him do his shows in these arenas and seeing these crowds, I'm like, wow. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=695.02s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=699.02s)]
*  It's pretty wild, dude. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=700.14s)]
*  It is pretty wild. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=701.14s)]
*  You know, and you go back to him taking that chance and leaving the Travel Channel. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=702.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=705.38s)]
*  It was a big risk on his part actually because that's the equivalent of, because we all knew [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=707.3s)]
*  comics like this and it's just the reality of what it is. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=712.1s)]
*  When you start working as a comedian and you have your circle of friends, there's a number [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=716.62s)]
*  of them who as you start to do road gigs, and these are low paying, you're not a ticket [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=725.14s)]
*  seller, you're just doing these gigs, and you're like, are you going to do some of these [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=730.06s)]
*  gigs? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=734.74s)]
*  And they're like, nah, I have this job and the job provides the consistency and the comfort. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=736.1s)]
*  It's reliable. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=746.7s)]
*  They're like, oh, I'll get my paycheck. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=747.7s)]
*  And then what happens is you doing these, like they're making more money than you because [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=749.66s)]
*  you're doing the bullshit comic, but then your comedy starts to get better because you're [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=755.0600000000001s)]
*  doing standup all the time. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=760.22s)]
*  And then you get more opportunities and then they go like, hey, I want to do that, but [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=762.54s)]
*  like five years have gone by. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=766.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=768.26s)]
*  And you're like, yeah, but you've been in this day job. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=769.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=771.66s)]
*  Right? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=772.66s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, you're getting opportunities to do TV specials or like comics. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=773.66s)]
*  They want you to just grab their hand. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=777.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=779.54s)]
*  And then they go. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=780.54s)]
*  And take them with you on the road. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=781.54s)]
*  What happened? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=782.54s)]
*  You're like, well, you didn't take the leap. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=783.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=784.54s)]
*  And Burt kind of had that comfort of that TV show. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=785.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=788.58s)]
*  It's a good check. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=789.58s)]
*  It's not like, it's not a bullshit check. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=790.58s)]
*  It's a good, it's a good living. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=792.0200000000001s)]
*  It's on TV. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=793.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=794.0200000000001s)]
*  But when he decided, no, no, I got to go make a full leap, that was, that's a leap, you [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=795.0200000000001s)]
*  know, that's a leap. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=799.58s)]
*  And then it paid off obviously tremendously. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=801.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=803.0200000000001s)]
*  You know the story. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=804.0200000000001s)]
*  I called him up and he was on a motorcycle in Vietnam. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=805.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=807.0200000000001s)]
*  I was like, you got to quit that job. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=808.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=809.0200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=810.0200000000001s)]
*  But I was right. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=811.0200000000001s)]
*  I was like, you can't just, first of all, it's just not healthy for you or your family [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=812.0200000000001s)]
*  for you to be gone three, four months at a time. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=815.14s)]
*  No, no. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=817.34s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=818.34s)]
*  And you're working and you got to do what you got to do, but it can't, it's not good [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=820.1s)]
*  for you. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=822.46s)]
*  No. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=823.46s)]
*  And also you're just, you're not reaching your potential as a standup. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=824.46s)]
*  You're a hilarious guy. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=826.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=827.94s)]
*  Great on podcasts. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=828.94s)]
*  Totally. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=829.94s)]
*  That's where you should be focusing your energy. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=830.94s)]
*  But back when he first got on that show, podcasts were bullshit. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=833.1800000000001s)]
*  Like when he first told the machine story on my podcast, who the fuck is watching it? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=836.4200000000001s)]
*  No one's watching it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=840.74s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=841.74s)]
*  Podcasts were bullshit. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=842.74s)]
*  So it was like me saying, go do a podcast. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=843.74s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=844.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=845.74s)]
*  I have kids. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=846.74s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=847.74s)]
*  I'm not doing a job. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=849.14s)]
*  I can't quit a TV job. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=850.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=851.14s)]
*  It sounds insane. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=852.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=853.14s)]
*  I think I, cause I started to do big, like bigger shows and selling out clubs back then [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=854.14s)]
*  too. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=858.1s)]
*  And he was like, how is this happening? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=859.1s)]
*  I was like, you just, I go, I'm doing standup all the time. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=860.1s)]
*  I do this podcast every week. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=862.94s)]
*  I just got a special out and all of it combined together. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=864.9s)]
*  And I was like, you can do this too. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=868.78s)]
*  He was like, oh, I don't know. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=869.78s)]
*  And then he was like, and then I remember him telling, he's like, I did it. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=873.14s)]
*  I'm not doing the, I quit. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=875.78s)]
*  I'm not doing the travel channel. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=876.78s)]
*  I'm not doing the travel channel. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=877.8199999999999s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=878.8199999999999s)]

*  Well, it worked out. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=880.8199999999999s)]
*  Luckily. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=881.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=882.8199999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=883.8199999999999s)]
*  Well, I could go the other way too. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=884.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  But that thing about guys who don't take the leap, I bet that's in every walk of life or [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  people just don't, but whatever it is when you're not all in. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=890.6999999999999s)]
*  But if you, if that's the fucking, the haunting thing about the comedy world, if you're not [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=895.3s)]
*  all in and someone else is, I remember when I was on fear factor. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=899.18s)]
*  So I was, you know, doing standup when I could, but God damn it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=903.5799999999999s)]
*  I was working a lot. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=907.5799999999999s)]
*  I was working a lot. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=908.5799999999999s)]
*  I was just, it was a lot of hours. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=909.5799999999999s)]
*  And I remember I'd go to the store and I'd run into someone who was a full-time comic [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=912.26s)]
*  and they're on the road. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=916.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=917.5799999999999s)]
*  I just did a West Palm. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=918.5799999999999s)]
*  I was there Thursday, Friday, Saturday. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=919.8599999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, that sounds so much better. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=920.8599999999999s)]
*  Sounds like so much more fun. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=924.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=926.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=927.18s)]
*  To me, it was like doing standup seemed so much better. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=928.18s)]
*  It just seemed like a better life. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=932.26s)]
*  Like that's, that's what I'm, it's more interesting. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=934.6600000000001s)]
*  You also have to have a, like when I look back at the choices I made early on in standup, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=937.74s)]
*  you know, you actually are in a bit of denial about how bad you are, not just how bad you [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=944.62s)]
*  are, how bad your life is. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=951.6600000000001s)]
*  Like, like, I mean, I'm not living in a, like all my friends with regular jobs have [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=953.4200000000001s)]
*  a much better quality of life. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=963.06s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=964.54s)]
*  It didn't even bother me really. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=965.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=966.6999999999999s)]
*  Because you wanted it so bad. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=967.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=968.6999999999999s)]
*  I just wanted it so bad that you, I'm saying you, you have a bit of, you have a delusion [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=969.6999999999999s)]
*  almost right? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=973.02s)]
*  Like people see where you live and they, and they're like, how much money are you making? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=974.02s)]
*  But you're used to it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=979.14s)]
*  You're so used to it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=980.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=981.14s)]
*  As long as you're used to it, it's fine. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=982.14s)]
*  If you, now one thing would be like, say if you had some white collar job and you're making [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=983.14s)]
*  six figures a year and then you decided to go to standup and then you were living in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=987.42s)]
*  the place like you were living in when I met you, then it would suck a fat dick. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=992.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=996.1s)]
*  Because you'd be like, fuck, now I'm falling apart. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=997.1s)]
*  It's very difficult for people to downsize with the intention of upsizing eventually. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=999.4200000000001s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1005.5400000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1006.5400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1007.5400000000001s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1008.5400000000001s)]
*  But if that, you would be so much happier if you could kind of get by doing what you [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1009.5400000000001s)]
*  like to do and then you could eventually make more money doing that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1014.34s)]
*  The more money thing, the most important thing is what are you, are you doing what you want [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1018.84s)]
*  to do? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1022.72s)]
*  Because we don't have much time. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1023.72s)]
*  We just don't. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1024.94s)]
*  I'm 55. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1025.94s)]
*  I'll be 56 in a month. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1026.94s)]
*  That's 56. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1028.44s)]
*  That's old as shit. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1029.44s)]
*  When I was a kid, I thought 56 year old people were archaic wrecks that could barely standup. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1030.44s)]
*  You know, you're in the doctor's office every couple of weeks, something's falling apart. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1038.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but look at you, man. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1042.64s)]
*  You're happy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1045.0800000000002s)]

*  Luckily. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  I hit the science and knowledge and fitness world and vitamin supplementation, hormone [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1048.96s)]
*  supplementation. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1056.12s)]
*  All of it came right when I got old. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1057.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1059.6799999999998s)]

*  I had a double whammy, right, when I got injured. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1179.56s)]
*  I tore my patellar tendon. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1182.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1184.16s)]
*  At the same time. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1185.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1186.8000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, the patellar is not like MCL, ACL. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1187.8000000000002s)]
*  That leg is completely useless. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1188.8000000000002s)]
*  There's no hinge anymore. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1191.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1192.8000000000002s)]
*  So, your knee doesn't, it just hangs. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1193.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1195.8000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1196.8000000000002s)]
*  So, you have to reattach the tendon. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1197.8000000000002s)]
*  And for that to heal and be able to use it again, it takes, just for it to heal takes about [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1198.8000000000002s)]
*  two months, then your muscle has atrophied completely, like your quad has completely [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1204.48s)]
*  atrophied. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1209.16s)]
*  So, you have to learn how to walk and learn how to do steps again and learn how to, you [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1210.16s)]
*  know, it's a complete, complete like debilitating type of injury. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1214.24s)]
*  So when I got, and they're both at the same time. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1219.3600000000001s)]
*  So when I got injured, all the people in the hospital, doctors, PTs, they all looked at [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1222.24s)]
*  my arm and they're like, that's not going to be a problem. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1228.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1230.8s)]
*  And you think about it, you're like, yeah, you see people in casts all the time. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1231.8s)]
*  They're like, you'll be fine with that. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1233.72s)]
*  That leg, that's going to be your problem. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1236.0800000000002s)]
*  And it ended up being the opposite. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1239.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1240.32s)]
*  Oh, that's right, because of the nerve damage. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1241.32s)]
*  I still have problems. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1243.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1244.2s)]
*  I still have nerve issues. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1245.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1246.2s)]
*  How bad is it now? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1247.2s)]
*  Well, you know, an interesting thing, remember we did Sober October? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1248.2s)]
*  You remember, like, I showed you me doing pushups with my shirt off. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1251.2s)]
*  So like my left rhomboid wasn't even firing. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1260.2s)]
*  So what happens is when you, when you have like a muscle, a nerve sends a signal to your [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1261.2s)]
*  muscle. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1265.88s)]
*  If there's nerve trouble going to that muscle, the muscle just doesn't fire. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1266.88s)]
*  When I was doing pushups, because that wasn't firing, you have other muscles that compensate. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1271.72s)]
*  That's the way your body works. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1277.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1278.04s)]
*  So like, if you're going like this, and that rhomboid doesn't fire, then like your lat [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1279.04s)]
*  starts to pick up for it. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1283.16s)]
*  Oh. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1284.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1285.72s)]
*  So it's like, and it's doing it like unbeknownst to your mind. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1286.72s)]
*  It's just doing it on its own. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1288.2s)]
*  So I had like insane, it took me like six months to recover from the hundred pushups [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1290.28s)]
*  a day. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1295.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1296.28s)]
*  I wasn't able to use like the full strength of my body to do a normal pushup. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1297.28s)]
*  Is it firing now? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1302.44s)]
*  It's firing now because I actually have been like treating, I went to this place called [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1303.8s)]
*  Wired and they put these like. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1307.48s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1309.68s)]
*  Neuromuscular stimulation. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1310.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1311.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1312.68s)]
*  That's really good. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1313.68s)]
*  Electrical muscular stimulation. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1314.68s)]
*  That EMS stuff is really good for injury recovery. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1315.68s)]
*  That has helped me quite a bit. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1318.04s)]
*  But I still, the thing that I have is like this great, like weird, I don't know how to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1320.6s)]
*  describe it, arm pain. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1325.68s)]
*  When like, if I try to like, if we were to like, if I was to jam you like this, like [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1328.44s)]
*  hands, it sends an incredibly painful signal through my arm. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1331.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1336.6399999999999s)]
*  Especially like the bicep tendon, things like that. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1337.6399999999999s)]
*  So I'm just always like, I'm trying new things. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1342.08s)]
*  I do different things in the gym. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1344.6s)]
*  I do treatments like that. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1346.48s)]
*  I'm going to get another nerve analysis done where they send these signals through your [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1347.72s)]
*  arm. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1351.44s)]
*  Have you done any hyperbaric chamber stuff? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1352.44s)]
*  No. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1354.36s)]
*  That's supposed to be very good with people with nerve issues. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1356.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to try it. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1358.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, it's double the atmosphere. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1359.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1360.4399999999998s)]
*  It really helps recover. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1361.4399999999998s)]
*  You can just read a book. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1362.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1365.0s)]
*  I'll try that. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1366.0s)]
*  It's very relaxing. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1367.0s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1368.0s)]
*  But it's funny though, because you think, oh, broken arm, just throw a cast on that thing [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1369.0s)]
*  and you'll be done. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1372.7199999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1373.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's been, yeah, it's been a couple of years. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1374.7199999999998s)]
*  It's not completely healed. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1377.3999999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1378.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1379.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1380.7199999999998s)]
*  Injuries, the one good thing about injuries is when you do get over them. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1381.7199999999998s)]
*  If you could remember, because when you're injured, you're like, god damn it, why wasn't [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1384.84s)]
*  I appreciating being healthy? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1388.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1389.6s)]
*  Same way I feel when I'm sick. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1390.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1392.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1393.6s)]
*  Well, you said, you know, you asked me about like turning points. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1394.6s)]
*  The other big one was that, you know, about a little over a year ago, I realized that [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1397.1599999999999s)]
*  I was just regressing again. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1408.1999999999998s)]
*  And that was actually the big turning point for me. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1411.0s)]
*  It was that I had kind of recovered for the most part from the injuries. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1414.16s)]
*  And I was like, okay, I'm like healthy again. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1418.16s)]
*  And I felt myself regressing again. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1420.2800000000002s)]
*  I went to shoot this thing and I was like, I just saw myself. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1422.7600000000002s)]
*  I was like, oh, I'm going backwards again. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1426.8400000000001s)]
*  It bothered me. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1429.88s)]
*  Is it food? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1430.88s)]
*  I think it was food. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1432.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1433.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1434.5200000000002s)]
*  But I just, I kind of was like, oh, I can't go back again. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1435.5200000000002s)]
*  Dude, that carnivore diet kills all that. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1437.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  You just can't overeat. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1441.0800000000002s)]
*  You don't overeat. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1444.24s)]
*  Are you doing that right now? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1445.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1446.24s)]
*  I know when to stop eating. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1447.24s)]
*  If I am eating, say like a steak and mashed potatoes and French fries and other stuff [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1449.6399999999999s)]
*  and bread, bread and butter, I'll just keep eating the mashed potatoes. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1459.04s)]
*  Even after I'm done eating steak, I'll keep eating fries. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1462.56s)]
*  I'll have another piece of bread. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1465.52s)]
*  And all that stuff is just empty calories. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1468.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's carbohydrates. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1469.8s)]
*  It's not empty. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1470.8s)]
*  It's just, it's unnecessary. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1472.04s)]
*  You're eating more than your body's going to burn off. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1474.44s)]
*  And you're just, it's just for me, it's gluttony. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1476.44s)]
*  What's a normal day for your eating? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1478.56s)]
*  Like what do you, what's breakfast? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1480.44s)]
*  Today was Neil Guy steaks and bacon. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1482.36s)]
*  So I cooked a couple of these small Neil Guy steak. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1485.76s)]
*  Neil Guy's an antelope that I shot in Texas. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1489.1599999999999s)]
*  So I fried that and fried, I fried bacon first. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1492.6399999999999s)]
*  And then I cooked the Neil Guy and bacon fat. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1496.28s)]
*  Cause you need fat. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1498.32s)]
*  Neil Guy's a very lean animal. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1499.68s)]
*  And if you're in a fat burning state, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1501.76s)]
*  which is the one I'm in right now, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1504.56s)]
*  you have to have some sort of fats. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1506.0s)]
*  So I like avocado oil. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1508.3999999999999s)]
*  I'd like some of that Primal Kitchen mayonnaise. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1511.44s)]
*  It's made with avocado oil. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1513.6s)]
*  I'm not like avoiding vegetables per se, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1515.68s)]
*  but I'm 100% I'm avoiding bread and pasta [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1518.2s)]
*  and all that other bullshit. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1520.3999999999999s)]
*  And just when I, if I have, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1521.52s)]
*  I'll have a piece of asparagus every now and then, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1523.76s)]
*  but I'm not like thinking about vegetables. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1526.24s)]
*  I take a shit ton of vitamins. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1528.84s)]
*  You take fruit, you eat fruit too? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1530.44s)]
*  Yeah, I eat fruit when I want to. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1531.56s)]
*  But most of my meals are steak and eggs. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1533.76s)]
*  Most of my meals, most of my meals are steak, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1535.96s)]
*  steak, eggs, steak, bacon. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1538.28s)]
*  That's most of my meals. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1540.24s)]
*  And I feel fucking great. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1541.16s)]
*  What's wild is joint pain. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1543.4s)]
*  Like I've had a left knee that's been fuck with me forever. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1545.76s)]
*  And I don't feel anything now. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1548.76s)]
*  It's been two months on this diet, two plus months now. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1550.8s)]
*  And it's like, it just accelerated the healing. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1553.48s)]
*  You feel way better. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1556.04s)]
*  I think, I think when you're eating a lot of shit, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1556.88s)]
*  your body is in a state of inflammation. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1559.96s)]
*  Like I think most people are in, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1561.96s)]
*  you know, there's a scale of like how much inflammation [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1565.0s)]
*  your body's carrying. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1567.8s)]
*  And you don't think about inflammation [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1568.88s)]
*  just because it's just how you are. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1570.32s)]
*  And you're not eating anything crazy. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1572.04s)]
*  I had spaghetti for dinner [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1574.08s)]
*  and I had a Subway sandwich for lunch. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm not eating McDonald's. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1577.28s)]
*  And you think you're not eating inflammation causing foods, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1578.72s)]
*  but you are. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1581.76s)]
*  And you don't realize it until you cut those [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1582.6000000000001s)]
*  out of your diet. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1584.48s)]
*  So much sugar. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1585.32s)]
*  I think it's sugar, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1586.2s)]
*  but I also think there's a lot going on with wheat. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1587.96s)]
*  I think with the complex glutens and I mean, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1590.92s)]
*  and there could possibly be something with glyphosate. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1593.48s)]
*  There's a lot of people that's- [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  What's glyphosate? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1598.68s)]
*  Glyphosate is Roundup. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1599.52s)]
*  That's that chemical that they spray on weeds [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1600.68s)]
*  that they found something like 94% of people [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1603.48s)]
*  have it in their blood. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1606.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1607.52s)]
*  You know, and the pesticide apologist will say, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1608.3600000000001s)]
*  oh, it's just a small number. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1612.04s)]
*  It's hardly anything. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1613.76s)]
*  It's fucking poison. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1616.72s)]
*  100% cancer causing poison and 94% of the people [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1618.08s)]
*  have it in their body. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1620.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1621.32s)]
*  And by the way, if they're measuring it [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1622.1599999999999s)]
*  and you're getting an average [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1624.28s)]
*  of what these people have in it, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1625.8s)]
*  well, what's the high end? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1627.32s)]
*  There's gotta be some zeros too, right? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1629.6399999999999s)]
*  There's gotta be people who all need organic [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1631.72s)]
*  and they don't have any in them. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1633.24s)]
*  So what's the high end? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1634.3999999999999s)]
*  Like how bad off are those people? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1636.28s)]
*  What about people that work on a farm? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1637.48s)]
*  Like what's their- [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1640.32s)]
*  And they're just breathing that in all day. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1641.1599999999999s)]
*  What's their fucking blood work look like? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1644.96s)]
*  Like what? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1645.8s)]
*  There's a better way to do it [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1648.04s)]
*  and they don't wanna do it the better way [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1649.36s)]
*  because it's more expensive and it's difficult [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1651.24s)]
*  to do it regenerative farm. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1654.0s)]
*  But if you do it this way with Roundup [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1655.9199999999998s)]
*  and they use it everywhere, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1658.32s)]
*  it's like, this stuff is fucking sketchy. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1659.36s)]
*  Yeah, I've never really spent time thinking much about [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1662.6799999999998s)]
*  how wheat affects me personally. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1666.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1669.3999999999999s)]
*  I've never been, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1670.24s)]
*  the one that I do think about a lot is sugar. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1671.28s)]
*  And also because I'm somebody who, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1674.56s)]
*  I can just, I have to just deny myself. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1676.84s)]
*  Because I get into a pattern. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1680.36s)]

*  If I give myself, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1684.32s)]
*  and also there's this thing where you realize [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1686.1599999999999s)]
*  that you can really fall into [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1688.6s)]
*  peer pressure kind of situations. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1691.6399999999999s)]
*  Oh for sure, yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1693.04s)]

*  Isn't that crazy that description of what happened [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1946.18s)]
*  in the traffic stop seems so routine here? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1948.68s)]
*  Like there's an endless series of videos [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1951.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  Like we always have incidents in traffic stops. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1959.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1962.72s)]
*  I'm not saying blame is always one way or the other. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1964.12s)]
*  Sometimes it's the person in the car, sometimes it's the... [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1967.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1968.8s)]

*  You know what people have to think about with cops? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1972.36s)]

*  but I want you to try. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1976.0s)]
*  You know that feeling that you get [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1977.52s)]

*  There's a reason why they get road rage. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1985.24s)]
*  And the reason why they get road rage [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1986.08s)]
*  is when you are on the road and you're driving, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1988.1399999999999s)]

*  to change lanes. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1996.9s)]
*  So you're in this heightened state. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=1998.3600000000001s)]
*  And then when someone does something, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2000.38s)]

*  you are, we've all seen those videos of cops getting shot. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2032.9s)]
*  We've all seen those videos of cops pulling people over. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2036.78s)]
*  And then the windows explode and people fire on them. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2039.74s)]
*  We've all seen those. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2042.7s)]
*  They've seen them too. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2043.62s)]
*  They know people who've been shot. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2044.46s)]
*  They have no idea who you are. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2045.98s)]
*  They have no idea what's going on. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2047.7s)]
*  So when they come up to that car, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2049.58s)]
*  they are at a heightened state. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2052.14s)]
*  They have to be. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2052.98s)]
*  They are literally, to a criminal, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2053.8199999999997s)]
*  they're the professional enemy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2055.7s)]
*  Their job is to be the enemy of the criminal. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2057.2599999999998s)]
*  It's a fucking crazy position to be in in society. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2059.42s)]
*  And we don't treat it with enough respect. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2063.02s)]
*  And when the consequence, when it goes badly, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2064.9s)]
*  all we think about is that officer, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2068.7s)]
*  that's a representative of all police officers. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2071.46s)]
*  But it's not true. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2073.5s)]
*  It's true. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2074.34s)]
*  I think a lot of people too, it's kind of hard. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2075.18s)]
*  A lot of people, they go into getting pulled over [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2077.98s)]
*  with a heightened sense of emotion themselves. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2081.9s)]
*  Which if you are that person getting pulled over [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2085.1s)]
*  for whatever you got pulled over for, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2088.38s)]
*  if that's your mentality in that moment, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2090.34s)]
*  you are actually going to escalate things. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2094.62s)]
*  You are as the person getting pulled over. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2097.58s)]
*  100%. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2099.06s)]
*  And it does take an effort to go, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2099.9s)]
*  okay, this guy, like you said, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2104.1s)]
*  he's walking up here in a heightened state. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2107.3799999999997s)]
*  Like I can diffuse things, I can diffuse them [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2109.2999999999997s)]
*  by how I conduct this. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2112.98s)]
*  But some people, first you have the people [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2115.46s)]

*  who wanna lecture the police officer on his rights. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2119.4199999999996s)]
*  Like yeah, you can do that, man. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2123.8599999999997s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2340.44s)]
*  You know? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2341.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2342.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, they have huge, the biggest issue [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2343.1600000000003s)]
*  in commercial air travel right now is staffing. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2345.48s)]
*  Really? It's still staffing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2349.64s)]
*  Really? Absolutely. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2350.96s)]
*  It's still staffing. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2352.12s)]
*  It's why you're finding an incredible number of delays. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2353.84s)]
*  It's not just staffing for airlines. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2356.52s)]
*  It's also staffing at air traffic control. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2359.0s)]
*  So all that is together. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2361.52s)]
*  If you fly commercially, you'll notice that like, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2362.96s)]
*  I mean, it is a miracle to board and take off [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2366.04s)]
*  and land on time. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2371.24s)]
*  Almost everything is delayed. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2373.2799999999997s)]
*  It is delayed. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2375.68s)]
*  You have a lot of times, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2377.0s)]
*  everything is functioning well, then you get there. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2379.0s)]
*  I can't tell you how many flights are just like, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2381.36s)]
*  well, everything's ready to go, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2384.48s)]
*  and they're like, yeah, the crew's not here. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2386.16s)]
*  Crew's here, this crew has to swap out, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2388.2s)]
*  they've maxed out their hours. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2390.96s)]
*  Now we're waiting for a new crew. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2392.44s)]
*  This is like over and over, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2393.44s)]
*  and then it happens at air traffic control, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2395.2s)]
*  but they are not fully staffed yet either. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2397.16s)]
*  So this just is a huge delay thing. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2398.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, commercial travel just needs to be revamped. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2400.48s)]
*  Well, Pete Buttigieg is doing a great job. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2404.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2406.56s)]
*  They're doing great. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2408.16s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2409.0s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2410.8399999999997s)]
*  He's handling it. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2413.72s)]
*  Don't worry, he's got it covered. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2414.9199999999996s)]
*  Who's this? Pete Buttigieg. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2416.8399999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's my guy. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2418.3599999999997s)]
*  What is he? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2420.64s)]
*  Is he the, the, the guy? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2421.48s)]
*  He's the guy in charge of transportation. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2423.56s)]
*  That's a fucking shit show. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2425.88s)]
*  He's in charge of the fucking trains [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2426.72s)]
*  flying off the rails. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2428.48s)]
*  You've done a terrible job, Pete. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2430.68s)]
*  So was it during COVID, did people get fired, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2434.24s)]
*  and then they decided to do other things, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2437.48s)]
*  and they never took the jobs again? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2439.4s)]
*  Some people got fired. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2440.96s)]
*  Some people, well, I mean, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2442.08s)]
*  I think more people were even just let go. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2443.4s)]
*  Like, you know, there's a lot of places like that had [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2445.8s)]
*  to shut down their operations. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2448.68s)]
*  They had no more revenue coming in, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2450.2s)]
*  so they let people go. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2452.4s)]
*  And then you've seen what happened with, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2453.76s)]
*  what's happened with commercial real estate. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2455.2400000000002s)]
*  Commercial real estate is upside down in this country. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2458.92s)]
*  Is it? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2462.6s)]
*  Yes, you know why? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2463.44s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2464.6s)]
*  Because people don't want to go to offices still anymore. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2465.44s)]
*  Yeah, they want to do remote work. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2468.32s)]
*  They want to do remote work. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2470.04s)]
*  They want to work their pajamas and jerk off. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2470.88s)]
*  So the people who, if you have these big commercial [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2472.2400000000002s)]
*  buildings, I mean, they, the, it used to be like this [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2475.28s)]
*  huge asset to own this commercial real estate, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2480.5600000000004s)]
*  and now it's like a liability. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2484.32s)]
*  Because you have empty offices, dude. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2486.4s)]
*  You have empty offices all over the country, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2488.2400000000002s)]
*  and you can't fill them up. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2490.7200000000003s)]
*  You can't force people. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2492.6000000000004s)]
*  Then there's companies that have just, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2494.6000000000004s)]
*  I know somebody that owns a company that said, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2496.4s)]
*  he goes, I, like a lot of people, goes, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2498.88s)]
*  I wanted people to come here, and I want them in the office. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  And he was met with like such total resistance, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2505.4s)]
*  because I just realized I had to allow it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2509.48s)]
*  Like if we were going to continue to operate. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2512.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2515.12s)]
*  So he just gave in to his employees going, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2515.96s)]
*  no, we don't want to do that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2519.28s)]
*  Wow. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2521.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2522.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's a sizable operation he has. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2523.04s)]
*  Wow, so people just say, no, I want to work at home. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2525.32s)]
*  Yeah, and they're like, and I've been working, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2527.76s)]
*  and I'm effective. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2528.92s)]
*  And to a degree, they are, like in his case, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2530.2000000000003s)]
*  he's like, you know, the work was getting done. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2533.48s)]
*  I just prefer to have everybody operating [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2536.04s)]
*  the way we normally had. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2539.32s)]
*  But he was like, everybody was like, no. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2540.1600000000003s)]
*  I used to, I had to, I used to do an hour and a half commute [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2541.84s)]
*  every day, I don't want, I haven't done that now in two years, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2544.84s)]
*  I don't want to do it again. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2547.08s)]
*  And then he had to go like, okay. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2548.92s)]
*  As long as they're disciplined, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2551.0s)]
*  and as long as they're actually effective, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2553.08s)]
*  I could see that. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2555.12s)]
*  But then you got this stupid ass office. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2555.96s)]
*  What do we do with this place, with all these offices? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2557.6800000000003s)]
*  Hence why this commercial estate business [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2559.76s)]
*  is like in the shitter. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2562.76s)]
*  Wow, I wonder what happens with that. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2564.32s)]
*  Because it doesn't seem like that's gonna change. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2566.72s)]
*  But there are a lot of CEOs that are supposedly [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2569.0s)]
*  pushing back on all this stuff. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2571.04s)]
*  I keep reading articles every day. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2572.2799999999997s)]
*  The interesting thing is, you know how, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2574.56s)]
*  people always adapt, right? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2576.56s)]
*  Things, nothing just goes, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2578.3199999999997s)]
*  if something's losing money, people don't just go, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2580.04s)]
*  well, I guess we'll just lose money forever. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2582.0s)]
*  So there is going to be a point, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2584.44s)]
*  and maybe it's happening now, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2586.64s)]
*  where you're gonna start seeing something done [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  with this commercial property. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2591.0s)]
*  Like if things stay vacant, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2593.2s)]
*  they're not just gonna hold onto that for 15 years. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2597.36s)]
*  They're gonna turn that into something. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2599.68s)]
*  I was reading some dipshit comedian on Twitter [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2601.16s)]
*  saying that they should turn all that into housing [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2604.48s)]
*  for homeless people. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2607.44s)]
*  Yeah, that is very popular. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2608.32s)]
*  That's really good if you don't own the building, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2609.16s)]
*  you fucking communist. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2611.24s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2613.0s)]
*  I mean, I gotta say, that also reminds me of this, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2614.0s)]
*  and I know this will be unpopular [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2617.64s)]
*  for a lot of people to hear, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2619.08s)]
*  but the idea of forgiving student loans, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2620.84s)]
*  it's a fantastic theory, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2625.24s)]
*  but one thing that nobody considers [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2627.48s)]
*  who is a huge advocate of that is, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2629.6s)]
*  okay, so somebody owns that debt. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2631.7999999999997s)]
*  That debt is owned. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2635.9199999999996s)]
*  So are you saying, when you say forgive, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2637.64s)]
*  who are you saying will, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2639.96s)]
*  are you saying that the government [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2641.6s)]
*  will just pay all of that debt? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2643.24s)]
*  Do you have an idea the amount of debt that that is? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2645.8399999999997s)]
*  Somebody owns the debt. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2649.08s)]
*  So if you go forgive the debt, to what degree? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2650.64s)]
*  Are you just saying erase it? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2653.8799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't just disappear. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2655.24s)]
*  The debt is owned. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2657.04s)]
*  So when you say just pay it, who? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2658.7599999999998s)]
*  Who are you saying will pay it, in taxes? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2662.56s)]
*  Right, everybody's gonna pay it then. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2664.64s)]
*  Right, so that just doesn't get erased, is my point. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2666.2s)]
*  But there is a bizarre issue with student loan debt, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2670.0s)]
*  that student loan debt is the only debt [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2673.0s)]
*  that you can't declare bankruptcy. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2674.48s)]
*  Yeah, that part is. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2676.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2676.9599999999996s)]
*  That's crazy, that's crazy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2677.7999999999997s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2678.8399999999997s)]
*  But when you say forgive it, it's not just, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2679.9199999999996s)]
*  I think a lot of people say that and they go, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2682.52s)]
*  I just don't wanna pay this. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2683.92s)]
*  Yeah, of course, I understand that. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  But you realize that somebody has to pay it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2686.8s)]
*  It doesn't just go into the sky. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2690.24s)]
*  Somebody owns that debt. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2692.44s)]
*  So who's gonna pay it? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2693.84s)]
*  If you say that the government will forgive student loans, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2696.64s)]
*  I mean, that amount has to be in the trillions. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2700.7599999999998s)]
*  Wonder what it is, let's find out. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2705.92s)]
*  What's the collective student loan debt [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2707.52s)]
*  in the United States as of 20? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2710.04s)]
*  I do know there is a differentiation [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2711.36s)]
*  in this conversation that it's federal student loan debt, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2712.8s)]
*  not private student loan debt, which is a big difference. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2715.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2717.96s)]
*  That's companies that do on that debt [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2719.4s)]
*  versus the government that granted. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2720.8s)]
*  So this is just federal student loans. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2723.12s)]
*  Pretty sure of that. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2726.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay, so there's two different types of loan debt. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2727.76s)]
*  So I'd wanna know what it is [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2730.0s)]
*  compared to the military industrial complex budget. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2733.76s)]
*  Oh yeah, right. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2737.4s)]
*  That budget is astronomical. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2739.44s)]
*  That's a budget, boy. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2740.76s)]
*  They accidentally paid an extra six billion to Ukraine. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2742.44s)]
*  They're like, whoops. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2744.96s)]
*  Whoopsie. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2745.8s)]
*  See, with this statement, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2746.64s)]
*  I don't know if this is differentiating that either. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2747.8s)]
*  It says it's 1.78 trillion in student loan debt. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2749.32s)]
*  It's a lot, dude. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2752.8s)]
*  To the US. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2753.8s)]
*  That's more than people owe on any other type of debt [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2754.8s)]
*  in the US, except for mortgages, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2756.7200000000003s)]
*  though the Biden administration is trying to forgive [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2758.52s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan balances. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2760.8s)]
*  That's more than people owe on any other type of debt [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2763.96s)]
*  in the US. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2767.4s)]
*  Well, except for mortgages. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2768.9199999999996s)]
*  But I mean, you see what I'm saying? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2769.9599999999996s)]
*  Like if you just say, hey, forget, erase this debt. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2771.64s)]
*  Okay, I mean, I get it, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2775.16s)]
*  but you do understand that that has to come from somewhere. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2776.6s)]
*  It's not just them going. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2779.6s)]
*  Sign air debt. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2780.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2781.2799999999997s)]
*  That is both. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2782.12s)]
*  That is federal and private together. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2782.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, so that's all of it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2783.9599999999996s)]
*  1.75 trillion. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2785.2799999999997s)]
*  Click on that so we can see what it says there. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2788.9199999999996s)]
*  It says on average, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2790.4799999999996s)]
*  it says the cost of college has steadily increased [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2794.8399999999997s)]
*  over the last 30 years. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2797.28s)]
*  That time frame, tuition costs at public four-year colleges [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2798.36s)]
*  grew from $4,160 to $10,740, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2802.1200000000003s)]
*  and from 19,360 to $38,070. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2805.7200000000003s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2809.36s)]
*  At private nonprofit institutions [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2810.2000000000003s)]
*  adjusted for inflation, all costs have risen. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2811.6800000000003s)]
*  So has the need for student loans [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2814.2200000000003s)]
*  and other forms of financial aid. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2815.6800000000003s)]
*  Imagine if you're a person that makes 100 grand a year [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2817.1000000000004s)]
*  and your kid is going to school and it costs $38,000. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2819.4s)]
*  It's fucking insane. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2821.6000000000004s)]
*  And then your kid gets out [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2822.76s)]
*  and they get a $50,000 a year job [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2823.84s)]
*  and you realize they're never gonna pay this back. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2825.5600000000004s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2827.56s)]
*  What they're doing, it is... [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2828.4s)]
*  That's what they wanted to get rid of. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2829.7200000000003s)]
*  It says 92% of all student debt are federal student loans. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2831.08s)]
*  The remaining amount is private student loans. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2834.36s)]
*  Okay, so it's a trillion. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2836.52s)]
*  It's a trillion plus. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2839.12s)]
*  That's a lot, dude. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2840.96s)]
*  It's a lot. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2841.88s)]
*  And so how much have we spent on Ukraine [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2842.84s)]
*  and how much are we gonna spend on Ukraine? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2845.36s)]
*  But here's the thing, if you forgave that debt, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2847.84s)]
*  wouldn't that spark the economy? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2850.44s)]
*  Wouldn't, if people have more money, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2852.36s)]
*  the thing about when people have more money, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2854.52s)]
*  people spend more money. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2856.04s)]
*  When people spend more money, the economy does better. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2856.88s)]
*  If people are straddled with student loan debt, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2859.24s)]
*  I gotta think that somehow another cripples the economy. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2861.04s)]
*  I don't think you're wrong in theory about that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2863.16s)]
*  I mean, it would seem that you'd obviously have more to do. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2865.72s)]
*  You could do more with your money. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2870.32s)]
*  And it's not like you're giving people money, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2871.36s)]
*  you're just absolving them of debt. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2872.96s)]
*  Which is a huge one. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2874.96s)]
*  The real problem is the whole predatory [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2876.0s)]
*  student loan situation. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2877.88s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2880.6s)]
*  And it's also a real problem to saddle down [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2881.92s)]
*  a 17-year-old with debt that they will keep [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2883.88s)]
*  for the rest of their life. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2886.2000000000003s)]
*  And they hit you at that same time at the student union [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2887.2000000000003s)]
*  with your first credit card, and they're like, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2889.36s)]
*  just use this. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2890.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's got 29.9% if you are. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2892.0s)]
*  You're like, okay, you don't know what the fuck you're doing. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2894.4s)]
*  And you need to do it to build your credit. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2895.92s)]
*  I need to, I need to build my credit. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2897.32s)]
*  I wanna buy a car. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  You're paying 26 bucks a month for a coffee you bought. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2900.88s)]
*  It's crazy, it is crazy. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2904.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the whole thing is insane, [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2905.76s)]
*  but it's insane that we do it to kids. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2907.6800000000003s)]
*  Because kids don't have a sense of the future. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2910.2s)]
*  They just don't. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2914.72s)]
*  They've only been alive for 18 years. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2915.56s)]
*  18 years is not enough time to figure out [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2917.6s)]
*  what kind of debt you're gonna be in when you're 70. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2921.12s)]
*  Don't you wonder too why, why, when we're in school, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2923.52s)]
*  and it's still not a thing when kids are in school, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2927.72s)]
*  we don't really teach them about money. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2930.12s)]
*  You don't learn shit about money. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=2933.24s)]

*  You know. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3464.48s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3465.32s)]
*  Is that your new hour? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3468.0s)]
*  That's from 96, man. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3468.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3471.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, he's a murderer. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3471.84s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3473.5600000000004s)]
*  But you know, it's like, that's the beautiful thing [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3474.4s)]
*  about this business is you will run into those guys [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3477.0s)]
*  that are much more talented than they are popular. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3479.36s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3483.2000000000003s)]
*  And then you run into people that are much more popular [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3484.0400000000004s)]
*  than they are talented. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3485.72s)]
*  People that are really good at staying popular. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3487.08s)]
*  And that's not. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3489.2s)]
*  That's a skill set. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3490.04s)]
*  That's what you'll realize the longer you do this. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3490.9599999999996s)]
*  And I think that is only relevant in the internet age, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3493.16s)]
*  in the age of this, where like people, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3497.4399999999996s)]
*  there are people who always have that thing [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3500.2s)]
*  of like they know how to get people talking about them [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3502.04s)]
*  and juiced up about them. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3505.7599999999998s)]
*  And it becomes, it becomes like the thing [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3507.56s)]
*  that they actually worked on. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3510.3999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3512.4399999999996s)]
*  You go, what have you been working on? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3513.2799999999997s)]
*  They're like staying popular. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3514.12s)]
*  Right, like in my promotions. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3516.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3517.12s)]
*  It's a big thing. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3517.96s)]
*  But then you look at their standup and you go, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3518.8s)]
*  do you gotta do that with that stuff? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3519.64s)]
*  I remember, I remember like an early version of this [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3521.8s)]
*  where this guy was like, can you get me on stage [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3524.6s)]
*  at this club? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3531.0s)]
*  And he had, I kind of knew, I didn't know him well. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3533.04s)]
*  I probably should have listened to my own [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3535.88s)]
*  inner dialogue about that. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3539.16s)]
*  But I was like, you know, you feel the pressure [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3541.68s)]
*  when the person's right in front of you. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3544.24s)]
*  So I go, all right, so the club owner is there. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3546.68s)]
*  And I go, can my friend do a spot? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3551.56s)]
*  And they're like, is he good? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3555.4399999999996s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3556.72s)]
*  So he goes up and he pretty much just eats shit. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3560.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3564.6s)]
*  And I was like, fuck. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3565.64s)]
*  And so of course the club guys like, the fuck was that? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3568.08s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3572.16s)]
*  So I talked to him and I go, dude, you know, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3573.2s)]
*  he goes, if he'll let me do another set on the Late Show, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3578.68s)]
*  I'll do a different set. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3585.08s)]
*  And I was like, so I go, let him do a different set [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3586.68s)]
*  on the Late Show. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3590.7599999999998s)]
*  And the club owner's like, no. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3591.92s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3594.72s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3595.56s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3598.12s)]
*  How many years in with you? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3599.0s)]
*  A few, not many. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3600.2799999999997s)]
*  Not now. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3601.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3602.84s)]
*  And I go, all right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3603.96s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3608.36s)]
*  The reason I even brought this up is that the guy, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3609.2s)]
*  this is years ago, had the best website [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3610.84s)]
*  I'd ever seen at the time. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3614.4s)]
*  I was like, this website's fucking amazing. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3615.6s)]
*  And all his marketing tools were incredible. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3617.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3620.32s)]
*  He had cool business card. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3621.16s)]
*  And you went to his site and you were like, shit. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3623.44s)]
*  They geolocate? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3625.96s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3627.36s)]
*  His site looked like fucking Nike building. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3628.36s)]
*  I was like, this thing is fucking rad. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3631.52s)]
*  And he goes up on the first second set. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3634.16s)]
*  Not only does he eat shit, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3637.44s)]
*  but he does the same set as the first. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3640.2s)]
*  And I go, dude, you did the same shit. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3643.08s)]
*  And he was just like, yeah. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3644.88s)]
*  I could see he was in the... [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3646.52s)]
*  And I actually left it. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3647.96s)]
*  I go, all your shit is cool. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3648.84s)]
*  Your website. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3652.04s)]
*  I go, you gotta work more on what you're doing on stage. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3652.88s)]
*  So that's your priority. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3655.84s)]
*  Don't you think, though, that that's a distraction [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3657.44s)]
*  because they're not working on that other stuff? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  A thousand percent. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3662.7999999999997s)]
*  So they concentrate on the promotion [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3663.64s)]
*  because they're distracting themselves [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3666.68s)]
*  in the fact they're not working on the difficult stuff. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3668.4399999999996s)]
*  And not only is that 100% true, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3670.52s)]
*  but there's so many parallels in life to that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3672.9599999999996s)]
*  Sure. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3674.9599999999996s)]
*  We can all go, I'm working on this thing [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3675.7999999999997s)]
*  to avoid this thing. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3677.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3679.0s)]
*  And especially if you get good at the side thing, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3680.12s)]
*  and then people go like, oh, wow. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3682.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, your cooking really has gotten incredible. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3684.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3686.8799999999997s)]
*  And then you're just not working on anything else. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3687.72s)]
*  It's very easy to do. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3691.48s)]
*  Very easy. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3692.3199999999997s)]
*  And we can all trick ourselves. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3693.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3694.0s)]
*  Very easy to trick yourself. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3695.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's very easy to do, yeah. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3696.24s)]
*  With stand-up, it's incredibly easy to be like, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3700.44s)]
*  I'm working on this other project, though. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3703.56s)]
*  Right, and you can make excuses. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3705.2s)]
*  I did that when I was on news radio, for sure. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3707.48s)]
*  I was doing the same set for like two years. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3710.24s)]
*  I wasn't fixing anything. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3712.8399999999997s)]
*  Kills you internally. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3714.68s)]
*  Killed me, just my ability. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3716.12s)]
*  I wasn't connected to the material anymore. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3719.48s)]
*  I was just saying it. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3721.08s)]
*  And then I had one set in front of some producers, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3723.52s)]
*  and I bombed, ate shit. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3725.44s)]
*  And then I really felt bad. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3727.96s)]
*  I really felt, because I knew why I ate shit. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3730.2400000000002s)]
*  I knew I had a flat set, which was not connected. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3732.72s)]
*  And I knew I wasn't working on it. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3736.56s)]
*  I hadn't written anything in a long time. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3737.96s)]
*  And then I bored down, and I got way better. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3740.56s)]
*  Like, within six months, I was killing. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3744.04s)]
*  I was doing all this new shit. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3748.0s)]
*  I was completely reinvigorated. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3749.56s)]
*  I was also getting better sets, too. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3753.4s)]
*  Like, the set I bombed, it was like 1 a.m. in the main room [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3754.7200000000003s)]
*  where you cannot be sucky. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3758.76s)]
*  You have to grab those people and hang onto them. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3760.8s)]
*  You have to agree, they have to know you're good. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3765.2s)]
*  They've seen everything. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3767.2s)]
*  It's one o'clock in the morning in Hollywood. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  And I was going on after people [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3772.96s)]
*  that were way better than me. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3774.52s)]
*  Just ate shirt. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3775.96s)]
*  They're so good for you, those fucking bombs. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3778.8s)]
*  It's like heartbreak, too. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3781.76s)]

*  They were like, don't worry about it. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3823.64s)]
*  That thing's really big. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3824.68s)]

*  I'm like, how big is it? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3826.3599999999997s)]
*  And you know, my stat. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3827.44s)]
*  It blows out. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3828.2799999999997s)]

*  either on the patella or on the, what is it, the tibia? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3842.04s)]
*  It might be incorrect. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3846.6400000000003s)]
*  He's like, you're snapped in the middle. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3848.4s)]
*  He goes, which just takes a tremendous amount of force, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3850.6000000000004s)]
*  which makes sense. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3854.0800000000004s)]
*  And when you think about how, because I was leaping. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3855.0s)]
*  He's like, you're leaping as hard as you can. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3857.36s)]
*  Right, and you retired and you'd fucked it up [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3859.0s)]
*  the couple of days before, right? [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3861.2000000000003s)]

*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3864.32s)]

*  like it's an unusual place to tear. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3868.08s)]
*  Injuries, bro. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3871.52s)]

*  But you know what? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3875.52s)]
*  That's another good thing about martial arts and jujitsu. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3876.52s)]
*  It's like, I understand like that there's stuff [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3880.08s)]
*  you have to do to make sure you don't get injured as often. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3883.52s)]
*  Like that's one of the reasons why I stay strong. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3886.32s)]
*  Like I don't want to be weak. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3888.32s)]
*  When you're weak, you get hurt. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3889.6800000000003s)]
*  And old people, that's one of the major reasons [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3891.72s)]
*  why they fall down is just they're feeble. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3894.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3897.08s)]
*  There's an interesting video, not a video, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3897.92s)]
*  photography series of cross sections [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3901.76s)]
*  of people's anatomy done through MRI. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3905.8s)]

*  not saying you have to be a triathlete, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3923.76s)]

*  is so important. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3930.28s)]

*  is you have to have resistance, weight resistance. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3943.48s)]
*  People get into their, when they hear that, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3947.76s)]
*  they keep thinking like tremendously heavy weight. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3950.12s)]
*  Like, oh, I'm not gonna be a power lifter. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3952.96s)]
*  And you're like, no shit. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3954.8399999999997s)]
*  And you shouldn't even try to be, just. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3956.64s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3958.52s)]
*  Look at the cross section. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3959.3599999999997s)]
*  So the top is the guy who has the workout schedule. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3960.18s)]
*  And it's all muscle. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3965.16s)]
*  And then the bottom is just mostly fat, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3966.56s)]
*  the same size leg. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3968.8399999999997s)]
*  And there's just this weak ass, bitch ass muscle [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3970.3599999999997s)]
*  around the fat. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3974.2799999999997s)]
*  When I see that, I want to leg kick him. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3976.24s)]
*  That bottom one, just imagine. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3978.2s)]
*  You know what you see too? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3980.76s)]
*  You're slamming a shin into that. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3981.6s)]
*  When you're in the hotel gyms, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3983.12s)]
*  and sometimes you see these dudes of all ages, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3985.16s)]
*  but I would say starting at like 40 into the 70s [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3987.2000000000003s)]
*  is the guy who walks, he walks in [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3991.44s)]
*  kind of like the beginning of dropped head syndrome, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3994.0s)]
*  like this, and immediately you know [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=3996.8s)]
*  this guy's going to the elliptical or treadmill. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4000.44s)]

*  but if you want to avoid that path, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4009.2s)]
*  weight training. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4011.92s)]
*  Start lifting weights. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4013.02s)]
*  Have some type of resistance training. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4014.8799999999997s)]
*  Put your body under that stress, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4017.0s)]
*  your muscles and your skeletal structure [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4018.7999999999997s)]
*  under the stress of picking up something [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4020.44s)]

*  Golden Tiger's pretty fucking good too. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4567.34s)]
*  That one I have not been to. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4569.0199999999995s)]
*  Ooh! [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4569.86s)]

*  Phillip told me it was the greatest burger he's ever had. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4573.7s)]
*  That's why Phillip decided to make NAD C-Burger. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4575.66s)]

*  I ate three cheeseburgers and a chicken sandwich. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4605.86s)]
*  At Golden Tiger? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4608.42s)]

*  And a chicken sandwich. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4612.0s)]
*  Fried chicken? I might have been high. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4612.84s)]
*  Yeah, that was an off the rails moment. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4616.0599999999995s)]
*  I have my off the rails moments. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4620.179999999999s)]

*  And I don't think, another thing I absolutely love [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4630.3s)]
*  is a fried chicken sandwich. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4633.66s)]

*  Fried chicken and waffles at Roscoe's. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4637.0199999999995s)]

*  You go there, there's a lot of people, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4659.64s)]
*  last time I was there, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4662.02s)]
*  there was a lot of people I knew there. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4662.84s)]
*  A lot of comics. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4664.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4665.22s)]
*  A lot of dudes from the store were there. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4666.06s)]
*  I was like, this is, it's such a classic LA place. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4667.38s)]
*  Yeah, was it on Union? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4670.3s)]
*  Well, there's one that was near us, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4671.54s)]
*  when we had Sunset and Gower. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4675.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4676.660000000001s)]
*  It was right down the street. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4677.5s)]
*  So we used to get it for lunch there. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4678.5s)]
*  This is shit. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4680.34s)]
*  And yet it's one of those things, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4682.5s)]
*  the first time you hear it, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4683.42s)]
*  you're like, what are you talking about? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4684.26s)]
*  Why would you make chicken with waffles? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4685.1s)]
*  Doesn't even make sense. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4686.740000000001s)]
*  And then you sit there. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4687.58s)]
*  And you eat it. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4688.400000000001s)]
*  But it's also like the perfect chicken. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4689.240000000001s)]
*  Like your chicken's off the charts. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4690.38s)]
*  Yeah, fried chicken. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4692.02s)]
*  But it's also, it's like that recipe, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4693.22s)]
*  they got it down, they've been doing it forever. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4695.46s)]
*  They know exactly how to serve you a Roscoe's fried chicken. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4698.46s)]
*  You eat it like, oh, this is what I was waiting for. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4702.7s)]
*  Yeah, and then the sugar rush waffle. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4705.42s)]
*  And the fucking butter. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4707.740000000001s)]
*  And then you dip the chicken in the fucking, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4710.9400000000005s)]
*  maybe a little hot sauce too, fuck it, let's go. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4715.26s)]
*  I need naps right after that. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4718.18s)]
*  Naps, yeah, your insulin crashes, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4719.42s)]
*  your whole body's like what? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4721.820000000001s)]
*  Your sugar crashes. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4723.54s)]
*  What are you doing to us? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4724.66s)]
*  What is this? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4726.66s)]
*  And then you think though, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4727.5s)]
*  that there's people who eat like that every day. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4728.320000000001s)]
*  Every day. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4729.54s)]
*  I remember one time I had a double cheeseburger with fries [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4730.86s)]
*  and a large milkshake, it was like a large milkshake. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4735.42s)]
*  And by the time I finished a large milkshake, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4738.42s)]
*  I literally felt like I got poisoned. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4740.5s)]
*  I was like, ugh, ugh, felt terrible. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4743.46s)]
*  It was not worth it. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4748.7s)]
*  It's the wildest trick your body does to you, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4750.58s)]
*  especially with like a big heavy sugar meal. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4753.46s)]
*  Your body tricks you into thinking it's good [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4757.62s)]
*  while you're doing it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4760.26s)]
*  It does, it does, it's totally a trick. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4761.1s)]
*  You know that when you eat to capacity feeling, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4762.74s)]
*  and you're like, I feel sick? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4765.14s)]
*  I think I ate like that every day for 15 years. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4766.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's my number one problem. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4769.3s)]
*  Yeah, I was like. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4770.42s)]
*  But I don't do that when I eat the carnivore diet. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4771.46s)]
*  I don't do it. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4774.62s)]
*  Meat has a high level of satiety, I think is the word, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4775.76s)]
*  which means you get satiated real quickly. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4779.780000000001s)]
*  When your body's had enough, you're like, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4784.780000000001s)]

*  Yeah, it's good. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4787.66s)]
*  Then you just look over at that freezer, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4788.7s)]
*  you're like, is there ice cream in there? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4790.18s)]
*  You guys got ice cream? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4791.02s)]
*  Gotta earn that ice cream, son. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4793.94s)]
*  Ice cream is a, that's. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4795.22s)]

*  Oh, yeah, ice cream's good. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4799.34s)]
*  I'll get a whole fucking pint of that shit. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4800.18s)]
*  I'll get in there. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4802.06s)]
*  Yeah, I'll do the shit where like, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4803.14s)]
*  I see them at the grocery store, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4805.42s)]
*  and I start grabbing, and then all of a sudden, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4808.22s)]
*  like the next day, Christine will be like, [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4810.96s)]
*  are there six different pints of ice cream in there? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4813.1s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know, the kids are here. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4815.14s)]

*  I'm talking about the kids are here. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4817.7s)]
*  The kids ate ice cream. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4819.14s)]
*  Yeah, Mew's mint chocolate chip. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4820.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4823.5s)]

*  he took me to, we went to Baskin-Robbins, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4836.8s)]
*  and I had an ice cream sundae, and I was like, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4838.78s)]
*  this is the greatest thing the world has ever invented. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4840.26s)]
*  A hot fudge sundae. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4843.82s)]
*  I was like, it was insane. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4845.78s)]
*  Whatever the fuck marijuana does to your senses, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4848.42s)]
*  especially your sense of taste, it's insane. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4851.7s)]
*  Oh yeah, we used to in college, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4854.0199999999995s)]
*  we used to get high out of our minds, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4855.46s)]
*  like full bong rips, joints, like just eyes bleeding, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4857.78s)]
*  like, and then we would take a blender, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4861.86s)]
*  put in like a whole tub of ice cream, milk, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4866.46s)]
*  and then scoops of peanut butter, blend that up, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4870.54s)]
*  and it just felt like you were drinking peanut butter, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4873.74s)]
*  and when you're high, it's like, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4876.58s)]
*  and I would do it until I vomited. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4878.74s)]
*  I would drink them until I puked. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4880.94s)]
*  Because there's no alarm that goes off, it goes stop. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4884.34s)]
*  You're like, no, it's too, you feel like a dog, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4886.92s)]
*  like an animal, just like, if you leave a dog [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4889.0199999999995s)]
*  around the food at once, it just eats until it's sick. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4892.0599999999995s)]
*  Your body has to be so confused [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4895.099999999999s)]
*  as to what form this food is taking too. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4897.0599999999995s)]
*  Like if you're having like a milkshake, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4899.76s)]
*  there's so much sugar, and it's frozen, and there's milk, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4903.06s)]
*  like what is this? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4907.580000000001s)]
*  What is this? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4908.42s)]
*  What the fuck is this? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4909.26s)]
*  Your body has no reference, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4910.080000000001s)]
*  like if your body's eating an apple, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4911.46s)]
*  like this is a very sweet apple, but it's an apple, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4913.42s)]
*  I know what to do with this. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4915.580000000001s)]
*  Your body's eating that, it's like, what the fuck is this? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4917.1s)]
*  What is this? [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4920.26s)]
*  What is this? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4921.1s)]
*  It's not, yeah. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4921.92s)]
*  Like an ice cold Coca-Cola. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4922.76s)]
*  Oh my God, your body's like, give me more of that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4925.9400000000005s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4928.02s)]
*  Also that, everyone, we all know it, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4928.9400000000005s)]
*  that formula at McDonald's, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4931.46s)]
*  why that's the best tasting Coke [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4933.34s)]
*  and Diet Coke on the planet. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4935.34s)]
*  Why? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4936.94s)]
*  They have it, because what happens is, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4937.86s)]
*  when you're in an establishment, like a restaurant, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4939.5s)]
*  you get a formula, like the gun has a blend, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4942.5s)]
*  and there's definitely a different formula [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4948.34s)]
*  at McDonald's. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4951.5s)]
*  Oh, has there been anything written about this? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4952.82s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4954.9s)]
*  Oh, interesting, I didn't know that. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4955.82s)]
*  If you drive by a McDonald's, and you get a Diet Coke, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4958.54s)]
*  you'll be like, what the fuck? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4961.860000000001s)]
*  Okay, typically restaurants get their soda syrups [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4963.5s)]
*  in plastic bags, but Coca-Cola does something different [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4965.740000000001s)]
*  for McDonald's. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4968.1s)]
*  The fast food chain gets their Coke syrup delivered [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4968.9400000000005s)]
*  in stainless steel tanks. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4971.1s)]
*  According to the New York Times, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4973.02s)]
*  the material keeps the soda fresher, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4974.1s)]
*  and your tongue can taste the difference. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4976.02s)]
*  A thousand percent it can. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4977.820000000001s)]
*  Right, but is it a more potent blend, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4979.18s)]
*  or is it just because it's in the tanks? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4981.42s)]
*  I don't know, but it does taste so much better. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4982.9800000000005s)]
*  It says their filtration system is top tier. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4986.42s)]
*  Wow, there's all these articles about it being sub-tier. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4990.34s)]
*  And I would say both. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4992.66s)]
*  Like, regular Coke, you'll all of a sudden, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4993.9s)]
*  you're like, oh man, and Diet Coke. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4996.259999999999s)]
*  McDonald's has an article. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4998.099999999999s)]
*  McDonald's does. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=4999.9s)]
*  It says, there are many reasons that Coca-Cola [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5000.74s)]
*  tastes so great at McDonald's. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5002.66s)]
*  We simply follow the guidelines set by Coca-Cola [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5003.66s)]
*  and take steps to ensure that we serve [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5005.7s)]
*  a high quality fountain beverage. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5007.259999999999s)]
*  Well, congratulations, you do that. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5008.82s)]
*  The water and Coca-Cola syrup are pre-chilled [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5010.78s)]
*  before entering our fountain dispensers [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5013.139999999999s)]
*  with the ratio syrup set to allow for ice to melt. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5014.7s)]
*  Oh, so it doesn't get watered down with the ice. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5018.0199999999995s)]
*  So they are making it stronger. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5020.299999999999s)]
*  That's smart. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5021.58s)]
*  Doesn't this tell you something though, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5022.54s)]
*  how everything is in the details? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5023.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5026.339999999999s)]
*  This is something that probably a restaurant would be like, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5027.179999999999s)]
*  Coca-Cola would say, you should do this, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5029.62s)]
*  and they go, whatever. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5031.099999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5032.9s)]
*  Like, whatever, we'll just put it in the gun. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5033.74s)]
*  But I believe that McDonald's sticks to that [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5036.82s)]
*  because it is consistent, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5040.0599999999995s)]
*  and it is so much different tasting. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5041.86s)]
*  Even what they said about their straws. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5043.58s)]
*  So their straws are typically wider than a typical straw. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5045.38s)]
*  So you have a different amount coming in. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5048.38s)]
*  Yeah, give it to me. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5049.82s)]
*  Right in my face hole, you fuckheads. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5051.42s)]
*  Fuck my mouth with Coke. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5053.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5054.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5055.46s)]
*  Yeah, big old fat tube of it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5056.38s)]
*  So fucking good. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5058.62s)]
*  Extra syrupy, because what if the ice melts? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5059.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5061.42s)]
*  What if the ice melts? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5062.26s)]
*  Even their ice is better there. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5063.42s)]
*  They have better ice? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5064.900000000001s)]
*  They have better ice. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5065.74s)]
*  They have filtered water, they said. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5066.58s)]
*  There you go. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5067.7s)]
*  By the way, we're not paid by McDonald's for this. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5069.06s)]
*  No. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5070.74s)]
*  I don't even eat that stuff. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5071.58s)]
*  But if I did, it's filet-o-fishes. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5072.54s)]
*  I could eat five of those fuckers. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5075.620000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5076.740000000001s)]
*  I love filets-o-fishes. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5077.580000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what that is. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5078.5s)]
*  McDonald's has this thing too, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5080.18s)]
*  where there's a temperature swing [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5081.5s)]
*  where it goes from being the best thing [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5084.18s)]
*  you can eat at that moment [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5085.5s)]
*  to like this is dog food. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5086.46s)]
*  Unedible. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5088.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5089.22s)]
*  You're like, throw this down. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5090.06s)]
*  I was in California a few months ago, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5091.660000000001s)]
*  and I had a quarter pounder. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5094.5s)]
*  It was actually quite a while ago, 10 months ago. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5096.06s)]
*  And I had a quarter pounder for the first time [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5098.1s)]
*  in fucking forever. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5099.860000000001s)]
*  But I was starving. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5101.3s)]
*  And I had to eat, and I was headed to the airport. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5102.5s)]
*  I was just pulling this drive-through real quick [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5104.38s)]
*  to get a quarter pounder. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5105.740000000001s)]
*  It's so sweet. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5107.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5108.780000000001s)]
*  Like I could taste the sugar in a quarter pounder. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5109.62s)]
*  Their bread even is, I think, sweet. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5111.38s)]
*  Tastes like a pastry. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5112.820000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is interesting. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5114.54s)]
*  It was very good. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5115.58s)]
*  I enjoyed it. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5116.900000000001s)]
*  I really did. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5117.740000000001s)]

*  He loves silly shit. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5444.9400000000005s)]
*  So for him it was like the ultimate platform [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5446.5s)]
*  to find a non-sophisticated company [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5448.900000000001s)]
*  that doesn't recognize the internet [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5452.42s)]
*  so you didn't buy PepsiSpice.com [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5453.78s)]
*  before you released Pepsi Spice, you fucking idiot. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5455.5s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5458.98s)]
*  Back then, companies didn't even care about websites. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5459.9s)]
*  What's a website? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5462.3s)]
*  We sell Pepsi. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5463.139999999999s)]
*  Even now people still can hose. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5463.96s)]
*  You see it on social media where they'll grab [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5465.42s)]
*  a Twitter handle and the company hasn't locked it down yet. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5468.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5472.259999999999s)]
*  They can tweet like they're from that company. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5473.099999999999s)]
*  Well people are tweeting like they're from Bud Light now. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5474.46s)]
*  Because there's Bud Light, if you go Bud Light underscore, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5477.259999999999s)]
*  so they're making these very subtle commercials [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5481.58s)]
*  that are almost as nothing goes with wieners like Bud Light. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5484.7s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5490.62s)]

*  I didn't realize. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5492.7s)]
*  And people are like, what is this? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5493.54s)]
*  Is this real? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5494.86s)]
*  Is this a parody account? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5495.7s)]
*  And then it is a parody account. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5496.54s)]
*  But it's subtle. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5497.78s)]
*  I didn't realize that that, what's it called? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5499.86s)]
*  Them people abandoning it would be that, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5507.34s)]
*  it really has stuck. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5512.02s)]
*  And there was a, I saw an article about revenue [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5513.06s)]
*  and the share that they have of the market [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5517.9400000000005s)]
*  and how it has totally taken a shift. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5520.42s)]
*  Like $26 billion. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5523.06s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5525.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5526.3s)]
*  They really, really did. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5527.14s)]
*  Boy, that's the word I was looking for. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5528.26s)]
*  They were boycotting it. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5529.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5530.5s)]
*  And then the trans movement got mad [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5531.34s)]
*  that they didn't support Dylan Mulvaney. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5535.26s)]
*  So a lot of like LBGTQ and whatever the other letters are, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5537.98s)]
*  those bars stopped carrying Bud Light. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5543.54s)]
*  So it's really. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5545.58s)]
*  Because they felt like Bud Light didn't back them up. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5546.419999999999s)]
*  And then there was video footage of them [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5548.82s)]
*  sponsoring a pride parade. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5551.54s)]
*  So it's like a Bud Light parade truck [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5554.339999999999s)]
*  with a bunch of people dancing around like, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5558.459999999999s)]

*  How weird is it when you say pride, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5581.139999999999s)]
*  people immediately think of gay. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5583.3s)]
*  Pride means gay. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=5586.42s)]

*  That's true. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6045.94s)]
*  When he's an old man, he wants to look back. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6046.78s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't go to Bohemian Grove, [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6048.26s)]
*  but you know what I did? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6049.58s)]

*  Oh no. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6059.82s)]
*  And then he's talking to her while he's recording it? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6061.5s)]
*  Well, that dude was off the charts out of his mind. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6064.78s)]
*  Yeah, crack is. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6067.54s)]
*  I mean, he was out of his mind. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6069.38s)]
*  I mean, he was basically like Ray Liotta [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6070.7s)]
*  looking for helicopters all day long. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6072.259999999999s)]
*  I talked to one time about, to Dr. Drew, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6074.179999999999s)]
*  because you know, he's worked with so many drug users [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6076.62s)]
*  about the different drugs, right? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6079.339999999999s)]
*  And like how they can affect your brain. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6080.96s)]
*  And he said that there's certain drugs [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6084.72s)]
*  that most people, most, could like do, try. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6086.8s)]
*  And basically, you could try it, [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6093.12s)]
*  and you might be able to just be like, I did that, [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6097.0s)]
*  and go on with your life, right? [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6100.84s)]
*  And not have an addiction. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6103.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, of course, he's not saying to do that. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6104.6s)]
*  Right, he's saying it's possible. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6107.12s)]
*  But he said the one that has the highest probability [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6108.54s)]
*  to switch something in most people's brains [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6115.200000000001s)]
*  with a chemical composition, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6118.4400000000005s)]
*  it's like a light switch hits [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6120.04s)]
*  where you'll never be the same as crack. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6121.4800000000005s)]
*  He said crack, people that are completely fine [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6125.240000000001s)]
*  trying this and trying that, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6128.96s)]
*  he said that's the one where you can do it, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6130.72s)]
*  and just everything, forever, your brain has changed [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6133.58s)]
*  and will be in the, basically in the pursuit of crack. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6138.200000000001s)]
*  The next Sober October we should do. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6141.8s)]
*  We should smoke crack before October. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6144.5199999999995s)]
*  Like right before it, see who could not smoke crack [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6147.56s)]
*  through the whole month of October. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6149.84s)]
*  That'd be a real challenge. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6151.16s)]
*  I don't think it would, Norman said he smoked crack once, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6153.96s)]
*  he said he hated it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6156.44s)]
*  But what Drew was saying is that- [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6157.28s)]
*  Oh, but no, no, no, wait a minute. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6159.28s)]
*  Norman ate crack because he thought it was Molly. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6160.5199999999995s)]

*  And so we used to play all the time. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6434.5199999999995s)]
*  We both kind of sucked. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6435.679999999999s)]
*  You know, it was fun. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6436.599999999999s)]
*  Just talking shit, laughing, playing. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6437.44s)]
*  And we'd do gigs together and stuff. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6439.12s)]
*  And then I started meeting really good players. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6440.759999999999s)]
*  And then I started playing all the time. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6442.96s)]
*  And then I had a real problem. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6444.5199999999995s)]
*  To the point where my manager goes, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6446.44s)]
*  I think you're spending more time thinking about pool [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6447.679999999999s)]
*  than you are about comedy. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6450.719999999999s)]
*  And I was like, fuck, you're right. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6452.5599999999995s)]
*  I knew he was right. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6454.24s)]
*  I knew he was right. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6455.16s)]
*  Cause I was playing in tournaments, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6456.0s)]
*  like several times a week. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6456.84s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6458.04s)]
*  Oh, it was a problem. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6458.88s)]
*  I was playing eight hours a day. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6459.96s)]
*  Eight hours a day. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6461.76s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6463.12s)]
*  I never knew this about you. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6463.96s)]
*  Every day. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6465.12s)]
*  Every day. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6466.52s)]
*  If pool was a legitimate profession at the time, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6467.360000000001s)]
*  like back then it was very hard to make a living. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6470.0s)]
*  And then there was this camel tour [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6471.96s)]
*  and it wound up being a shit show. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6474.0s)]
*  And a lot of people didn't get the money. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6475.72s)]
*  You would've gotten into it. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6476.88s)]
*  100%, if I could have been a professional pool player, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6477.72s)]
*  I was obsessed. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6480.9800000000005s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6482.16s)]
*  You know why? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6483.0s)]
*  Cause the balls don't give a fuck. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6483.820000000001s)]
*  They don't give a fuck who's watching. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6486.400000000001s)]
*  They don't give a fuck how cool you are. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6488.84s)]
*  They don't give a fuck what you're dressed like. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6490.64s)]
*  They don't give a fuck if somebody likes you. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6492.3s)]
*  If you make that shot, you make that shot. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6494.54s)]
*  And to keep your nerves together [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6497.96s)]
*  and navigate around the table was a puzzle to me. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6500.78s)]
*  I was fascinated by it. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6505.0s)]
*  Cause it's just this, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6506.72s)]
*  you're in tune with these balls, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6508.84s)]
*  colliding with these other balls [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6511.8s)]
*  and trying to find the proper angle [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6513.52s)]
*  and plotting out the table in advance [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6515.320000000001s)]
*  to get the good angle on the next ball, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6517.68s)]
*  to get the good angle on the next ball. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6519.4400000000005s)]
*  It was just obsessive. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6521.64s)]
*  But you, did you get into trick shots and all that too? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6523.16s)]
*  Nope. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6525.84s)]
*  Couldn't give a fuck. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6526.68s)]
*  Get out of here with that shit. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6527.5s)]
*  I didn't want to learn it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6528.34s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6529.64s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6530.4800000000005s)]
*  It was just about cleaning the table. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6531.3s)]
*  If you get a trick shot and you got to kill yourself [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6532.14s)]
*  if you don't make it, then I'll watch. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6533.88s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6537.16s)]
*  There's no consequences. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6538.52s)]
*  There's no consequences if you miss a trick shot. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6540.52s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if you miss a trick shot. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6543.6s)]
*  I don't give a fuck if you make it. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6545.4800000000005s)]
*  It's kind of cool to see someone [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6546.92s)]
*  that has a really powerful draw stroke [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6548.400000000001s)]
*  and they can do these crazy trick shots. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6550.4400000000005s)]
*  But you're talking about just- [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6552.08s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6553.0s)]
*  What you really want to see is people playing pool [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6553.84s)]
*  at the highest level when you have to keep your nerve. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6557.52s)]
*  Do pool players consider, [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6560.28s)]
*  because I know there's multiple games. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6561.68s)]
*  I've played amateur, obviously, hanging out, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6562.96s)]
*  but some people play, what, eight ball? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6566.28s)]
*  What's the standard game called? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6570.400000000001s)]
*  Well, there's two main rotation games [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6572.76s)]
*  and there's one big gambling game. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6575.3s)]
*  The big gambling game is a game called One Pocket. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6577.66s)]
*  The reason why it's a big gambling game [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6580.58s)]
*  is because it's a very complicated game. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6582.34s)]
*  It's boring to watch unless you're a real aficionado [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6584.38s)]
*  that can never put it on television. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6588.06s)]
*  What One Pocket is, is say, this is the pool table. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6589.7s)]
*  I have this pocket here on the right-hand side. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6593.22s)]
*  You have this pocket here on the left-hand side. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6595.22s)]
*  I only can make balls in this one pocket. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6597.22s)]
*  You can only make balls in that pocket. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6599.9800000000005s)]
*  There's 15 balls. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6602.18s)]
*  There's 15 balls in a rack. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6603.86s)]
*  So when someone makes, you know, someone makes eight, [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6605.42s)]
*  that means they've made more than half, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6609.299999999999s)]
*  so they won the game. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6611.259999999999s)]
*  And then to make handicaps, like say, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6612.339999999999s)]
*  if you and I were playing and you don't play as good as me, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6614.139999999999s)]
*  I'd say, okay, I have to make 10 balls, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6616.299999999999s)]
*  you only have to make five. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6617.78s)]
*  We'll do it something like that. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6619.259999999999s)]
*  Or I have to make 13 balls, you only have to make two. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6620.4s)]
*  Damn. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6623.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, people make crazy matches like that, in that way. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6624.139999999999s)]
*  And they gamble for a lot of money. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6627.54s)]
*  I've seen One Pocket games for thousands and thousands [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6629.5s)]
*  of dollars. Really? [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6631.98s)]
*  Yeah, big money. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6632.94s)]
*  Now that sounds like what legit players play. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6633.78s)]
*  Most people play nine ball? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6638.139999999999s)]
*  Well, in leagues, a lot of people play eight ball. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6640.58s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6643.0199999999995s)]
*  Like a lot of bar table eight ball, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6643.86s)]
*  which is a little complicated because bar table eight ball, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6645.379999999999s)]
*  you have to have really good cue ball control [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6648.0199999999995s)]
*  because you're dealing with a lot of clusters. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6649.5s)]
*  So you have to know how to move the ball around. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6651.099999999999s)]
*  It seems easier because you don't have long shots [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6652.94s)]
*  because the table's small, and it is. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6655.58s)]
*  It's easier for that. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6657.299999999999s)]
*  But it's harder for position play [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6658.66s)]
*  because you have very small room for error. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6660.139999999999s)]
*  And so you develop a real good sense [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6663.62s)]
*  of where the cue ball's going. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6665.54s)]
*  A lot of bar table players have a real solid cue ball. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6667.259999999999s)]
*  And then there is tournament play. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6670.0599999999995s)]
*  And tournament play is generally, [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6672.94s)]
*  usually either eight ball, or nine ball rather, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6675.219999999999s)]
*  and 10 ball for the pros. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6677.86s)]
*  So it's a rotation game. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6679.46s)]
*  Nine ball I'm familiar with. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6680.62s)]
*  Nine ball, the balls are wild. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6682.62s)]
*  So nine ball, you break, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6684.46s)]
*  you make the nine ball on the break, that's a game. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6686.42s)]
*  You won. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6688.46s)]
*  You make a one nine combination, you win. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6689.3s)]
*  10 ball, no balls are wild. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6691.54s)]
*  So unless you play it wild, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6694.18s)]
*  there's different ways people can play. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6695.86s)]
*  But generally speaking, it's call shot. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6697.06s)]
*  You have to call every shot you make. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6699.54s)]
*  So the one, if you're making a one five combination, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6701.58s)]
*  you call the five ball combination. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6704.62s)]
*  No bullshit, you can't. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6705.46s)]
*  No bullshit. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6706.42s)]
*  You can get lucky occasionally. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6707.58s)]
*  And the way you get lucky is say if you call [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6710.02s)]
*  that corner pocket and you miss, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6711.62s)]
*  but it bounces off the rail, hits the other rail, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6714.26s)]
*  and comes back in that corner pocket, it still counts. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6716.34s)]
*  It still counts. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6718.3s)]
*  It's a fluke. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6719.14s)]
*  You got the luckiest of lucky. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6719.98s)]
*  But only because you actually called the pocket. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6722.18s)]
*  I got you. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6723.9800000000005s)]
*  It really shouldn't even count then. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6724.82s)]
*  You should really say how you do it, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6725.74s)]
*  but that's not how it works. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6727.02s)]
*  And then there's games where you play the 10 ball counts [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6728.46s)]
*  on the break and that's a win, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6731.14s)]
*  but most of the times they don't. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6732.3s)]
*  Most of the time they spot it. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6733.58s)]
*  You have more, I realize this, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6734.82s)]
*  I've realized this over time, but even now, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6737.02s)]
*  you have more obsessions than most people I know, I think. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6739.06s)]
*  Yeah, I got a lot of them. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6742.02s)]
*  But a lot of people have none or maybe one, [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6743.58s)]
*  but you are kind of obsessed with a number of things. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6749.58s)]
*  Yeah, I could get obsessed with anything. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6755.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6756.9s)]
*  Anything good. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6757.74s)]
*  But I mean, you're kind of obsessed with standup. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6758.58s)]
*  You've definitely been obsessed with jujitsu. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6759.98s)]
*  You're kind of obsessed with archery, right? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6761.82s)]
*  Yeah, I just came from the archery shop. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6763.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of different disciplines [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6765.34s)]
*  that you're, things that you are trying to master. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6768.54s)]
*  I'm mentally ill. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6771.82s)]
*  Yeah, fitness, that's another one. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6773.0199999999995s)]
*  But I'm mentally ill in a very productive way. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6775.42s)]
*  That's true. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6777.38s)]
*  It's not a mental illness where it wrecks my life. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6778.860000000001s)]
*  It enhances my life. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6780.66s)]
*  But it's just, I know how to focus. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6782.02s)]
*  It's like saying, I have a 900 horsepower engine. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6783.740000000001s)]
*  That's why I keep crashing all the time. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6789.18s)]
*  Like, no, you need to know how to handle 900 horsepower. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6791.46s)]
*  If you know how to handle 900 horsepower [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6794.06s)]
*  in your race car driver, then you have a massive advantage [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6795.820000000001s)]
*  because then you have all this horsepower. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6798.820000000001s)]
*  You could fucking go. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6800.54s)]
*  That's me. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6802.26s)]
*  It's just like, I just have to find things to put that in. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6803.34s)]
*  If I'm just sitting around doing nothing, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6806.34s)]
*  my brain just starts plotting chaos. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6809.38s)]
*  I just start thinking dark things. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6811.82s)]
*  I just start plotting scenarios. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6813.46s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6815.66s)]
*  I don't trust my brain to be by itself. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6816.5s)]
*  It's like, that's why for me, it's easier. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6820.58s)]
*  Like when I say, just fucking work out, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6823.1s)]
*  just go do it, you'll feel better. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6825.38s)]
*  I know it's easier for me to say that. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6827.82s)]
*  It's easier for me to say that because I'm crazy [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6829.78s)]
*  and because I have to do it. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6832.22s)]
*  I know I have to do it. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6833.74s)]
*  I go out there and I do whatever I have to do [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6834.94s)]
*  and then I can manage all that other stuff. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6837.5s)]
*  But if I don't, I can get locked into something. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6841.0199999999995s)]
*  Like when I was playing pool for eight hours a day [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6843.62s)]
*  or I used to get into video games like that [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6845.5s)]
*  or I'd play video games or jujitsu. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6847.46s)]
*  The thing about jujitsu is you can't really do it [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6849.82s)]
*  all day long, your body breaks down. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6851.62s)]
*  I did as much as I could, but your body starts to break down. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6853.58s)]
*  What's a good session for like? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6856.219999999999s)]
*  Couple hours. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6857.62s)]
*  Couple hours. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6858.46s)]
*  Couple hours, yeah. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6859.28s)]
*  You do like an hour of drills [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6860.12s)]
*  and then you probably roll for an hour. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6861.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6863.099999999999s)]
*  But yeah, more than that, your body's going. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6864.14s)]
*  Your body's so beat. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6865.54s)]
*  An hour of trying to stop people from strangling you [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6866.700000000001s)]
*  and breaking your arm and fucking [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6869.780000000001s)]
*  ripping your neck off your head. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6871.900000000001s)]
*  It's fucking exhausting. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6873.62s)]
*  That's real work. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6874.860000000001s)]
*  It's exhausting. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6875.700000000001s)]
*  You get so tired. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6876.52s)]
*  That's why jujitsu people are so chill. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6878.42s)]
*  They get it all out. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6880.5s)]
*  They don't have nothing. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6881.700000000001s)]
*  You meet them in real life, they're like, hi. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6882.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6884.54s)]
*  They have no bravado, chest puffiness. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6885.38s)]
*  They're just fucking chilled out. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6889.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like the bit of boxing stuff [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6891.06s)]
*  I've done too, it's completely exhausting too. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6895.099999999999s)]
*  Same thing, yeah, same thing. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6896.08s)]
*  You meet a boxer in real life, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6897.72s)]
*  they're generally pretty fucking chilled out. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6898.96s)]
*  Especially one that's training all the time. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6900.96s)]
*  Yeah, that training is crazy. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6903.0s)]
*  There's nothing for me quite like hitting a bag [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6904.48s)]
*  for a workout that puts me in a great state of mind. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6908.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6912.68s)]
*  Like a great mood. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6913.5199999999995s)]
*  Doing rounds on a bag. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6914.68s)]
*  But by the time I'm done, I feel so good. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6916.46s)]
*  It gets everything out. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6919.36s)]
*  Smiley, I'm all happy. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6920.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6922.4s)]
*  It just drains all that monkey energy out of my body. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6924.1s)]
*  It just drains all that caveman out. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6928.42s)]
*  And when you hit like clean combos. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6930.9400000000005s)]
*  Ba ba ba boom. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6933.38s)]
*  Ba ba ba boom. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6935.1s)]
*  At the end you're like, oh I can't. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6936.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6938.9800000000005s)]
*  It's good, it's a good feeling. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6939.820000000001s)]
*  I like going ham. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6940.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6942.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6942.900000000001s)]
*  Well you're doing the kicks too. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6943.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6944.900000000001s)]
*  Finally I can do them again. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6946.3s)]
*  My knee's back. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6947.54s)]
*  It took forever. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6948.860000000001s)]
*  That's another thing that happened with this fucking diet. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6950.42s)]
*  Whatever weird joint pains I was having just went away. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6953.820000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6957.3s)]
*  I used to have occasional joint pain in my right knee too. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6958.14s)]
*  Gone. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6959.780000000001s)]
*  Don't feel it at all. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6960.660000000001s)]
*  Not at all. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6961.540000000001s)]
*  Same workouts, same stuff. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6962.38s)]
*  It's, I think I was carrying around a bunch of inflammation. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6964.540000000001s)]
*  Just from eating, I mean mostly clean. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6967.900000000001s)]
*  Mostly clean. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6971.620000000001s)]
*  You know, but I'll eat four cheeseburgers one night. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6973.46s)]
*  Or mostly clean. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6975.860000000001s)]
*  I'll have a fucking large bowl of spaghetti. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6976.9800000000005s)]
*  Mostly clean. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6979.34s)]
*  But every now and then I'll go off the rails. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6980.18s)]
*  To not going off the rails at all. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6981.58s)]
*  Remember one day I just felt like shit. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6983.26s)]
*  And I just decided, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6985.58s)]
*  what was the last time I felt really good physically? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6986.58s)]
*  I was like, this is the time that I did that carnivore diet. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6989.38s)]
*  So I'm like, let me do that again. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6991.74s)]
*  The thing that's most astonishing to me [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6993.46s)]
*  is the mental benefits of it. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6995.22s)]
*  When your brain is running on ketones, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6996.98s)]
*  it's a different feeling. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=6999.3s)]
*  It's a feeling like you're on a nootropic. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7000.74s)]
*  It's like you're on a alpha brain. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7002.74s)]
*  It's a feeling like you get a little extra room [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7005.14s)]
*  for thinking. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7008.74s)]
*  A little extra room for forming sentences. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7009.98s)]
*  For just even comprehension. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7012.74s)]
*  Understanding. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7015.259999999999s)]
*  I have more mental energy. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7016.099999999999s)]
*  I think it's a more efficient form of energy [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7018.0199999999995s)]
*  than carbohydrates are. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7020.419999999999s)]
*  I did find that I would, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7021.94s)]
*  I'd have like joint pain. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7024.58s)]
*  And when I was at the house and I'd feel that way, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7027.139999999999s)]
*  that was another benefit of like, [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7030.379999999999s)]
*  that feeling after cold plunging was like alleviating. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7032.7s)]
*  Like my knees would be like sore [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7036.7s)]
*  from like hitting the bike for a while. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7039.9800000000005s)]
*  Or squats. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7042.38s)]
*  And then you're like, damn, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7043.26s)]
*  like it really does feel alleviated. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7044.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, your body loves that. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7046.14s)]
*  Let's get that inflammation out of there. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7048.700000000001s)]
*  Oof. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7050.540000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that talk about it, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7051.38s)]
*  they're not being scientific benefit. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7053.660000000001s)]
*  And I literally hear it in their voice [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7056.1s)]
*  that they're trying not to go in there. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7059.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7060.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7061.660000000001s)]
*  Let's just say it doesn't do anything for you physically. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7062.5s)]
*  What it does for you mentally is inarguable. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7066.54s)]
*  It's inarguable. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7069.9s)]
*  There's real science behind it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7070.82s)]
*  It ramps up your dopamine by 200% [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7072.06s)]
*  and it lasts for hours. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7075.06s)]
*  Yeah, and the epinephrine or... [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7076.46s)]
*  And it carries through the rest of your day. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7078.94s)]

*  He just shot it. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7537.76s)]
*  Oh, he shot it. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7538.360000000001s)]

*  Oh, great. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7540.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like last week. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7540.64s)]
*  That'll be huge for him. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7542.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7544.320000000001s)]
*  It's amazing what that YouTube one did for him, though. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7545.280000000001s)]
*  I know. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7547.88s)]
*  It's a wild time. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7549.200000000001s)]
*  Did you see that Roseanne's podcast with Theo [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7550.76s)]
*  got pulled from YouTube for hate speech? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7554.16s)]
*  That's so funny. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7556.84s)]
*  I had something with them like a year or two ago. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7557.84s)]
*  This is so insane. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7561.24s)]
*  I'm going to send this to you, Jamie, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7562.16s)]
*  so we can go over what it is that got them banned. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7563.92s)]
*  Because it's so crazy. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7568.280000000001s)]
*  I can't even understand it. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7570.88s)]

*  I'm going to send it to you here. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7575.76s)]
*  So here is a thing on Twitter. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7579.6s)]
*  He put it on Twitter now, because that's really [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7584.4400000000005s)]
*  the only place you can put something like that, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7586.320000000001s)]
*  if it gets pulled from YouTube. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7588.320000000001s)]
*  So they pulled the whole episode, though. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7589.96s)]
*  They pulled the whole episode for this clip. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7591.68s)]
*  So we're going to watch this clip. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7594.320000000001s)]
*  And I just don't understand how someone [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7596.160000000001s)]
*  could think that this kind of censorship is OK. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7599.72s)]
*  Well, hopefully, they'll go through the flagging process. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7602.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7605.56s)]
*  It can't post for a week. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7607.56s)]

*  In 2012, one of my platform things [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7613.08s)]
*  was I will outlaw bullshit. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7616.36s)]
*  Because I know that horrified people, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7618.92s)]
*  because what will they do now? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7621.76s)]
*  They're addicted to it. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7623.76s)]
*  They'd rather have that than food or a happy family. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7624.76s)]
*  They're so addicted to their fucking bullshit. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7628.0s)]
*  It's true, huh? [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7630.04s)]
*  But comics, I think, we're the less free speech art form. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7630.72s)]
*  And as long as we're performing, things [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7634.72s)]
*  end as bad as they could be. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7636.8s)]
*  I think that's true. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7640.360000000001s)]
*  As long as we're performing, things [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7641.6s)]
*  aren't as bad as they could be. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7643.04s)]
*  And that's always been the case throughout time, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7644.52s)]
*  like with jesters or with people that we [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7646.400000000001s)]

*  There's always been a ceiling on speech, hasn't there, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7650.56s)]
*  in a way? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7653.76s)]
*  Of course. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7654.360000000001s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear the real truth. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7655.0s)]
*  They're horrified. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7658.0s)]
*  They'd rather go with bullshit. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7658.84s)]
*  It's easier. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7660.64s)]
*  Like, for the real truth that, you know, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7662.6s)]
*  and I'm glad that they did set up all these guidelines [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7664.68s)]
*  so that we only are allowed to speak the truth. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7667.4800000000005s)]
*  And the truth is that Biden got 81 million votes [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7670.6s)]
*  by winning 36 counties. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7673.8s)]
*  And that is just incredible. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7678.240000000001s)]
*  It really, really is. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7680.52s)]
*  And that of these 81 million supporters [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7681.56s)]
*  who gave him more votes than any president has ever gotten [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7686.320000000001s)]
*  before, he came with a mandate from these 81 million voters. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7690.160000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I'm just glad that they were very careful [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7694.16s)]
*  to make sure that nobody could detract [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7699.5599999999995s)]
*  from that proven truth. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7703.5599999999995s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7706.44s)]
*  Like, what do you mean? [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7707.32s)]
*  Like that nobody feels like it? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7708.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7709.92s)]
*  That they mandated that that was the truth [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7710.8s)]
*  and that nobody could say, well, what about no. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7713.8s)]
*  Oh, it was made a mandate. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7716.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7717.92s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know that. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7718.68s)]
*  So the government made it a mandate? [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7720.72s)]
*  Yeah, because, you know, YouTube did, and so did all the social. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7722.32s)]
*  So you can't speak. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7726.759999999999s)]
*  You can't even speak on that in those platforms. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7727.5199999999995s)]
*  No, you can't say, you know. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7730.16s)]
*  That it wasn't. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7731.88s)]
*  You can't say that, like, you know, the election was rigged. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7732.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's all a lie. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7735.88s)]
*  The election was not rigged. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7737.679999999999s)]
*  36 counties can give you 81 million votes. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7739.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7742.84s)]
*  That's a fact. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7743.36s)]
*  So it wasn't rigged. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7745.759999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7747.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7748.48s)]
*  36 counties have 81 million people in them. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7752.6s)]
*  See, that's the truth. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7753.6s)]
*  And don't you dare say anything against it or you'll be off YouTube, Facebook, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7755.44s)]
*  Twitter, and all the other ones, because we have, you know, [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7759.76s)]
*  there's such a thing as the truth and facts and we have to stick to it. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7763.2s)]

*  It's scary. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7768.76s)]
*  And that is the truth. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7770.28s)]
*  And nobody died in the Holocaust either. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7771.48s)]
*  That's the truth. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7774.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7775.44s)]
*  It should happen. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7775.92s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7794.679999999999s)]
*  It's like a it's like a lot of Hollywood is a Jewish business. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7794.839999999999s)]
*  Really? [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7799.0s)]
*  Well, they started Hollywood. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7799.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7800.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7801.32s)]
*  But so was it weird? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7802.04s)]
*  It's like rap. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7803.32s)]
*  Black people started rap. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7804.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7805.639999999999s)]

*  Of course, it's Jewish. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7823.28s)]
*  But, you know, and people should be glad that it's Jewish, too, because if Jews were not [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7824.76s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7832.48s)]
*  See what I'm saying? [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7833.4s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7835.16s)]
*  So that that's kind of a full ride. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7836.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7839.08s)]
*  That got them pulled. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7839.44s)]
*  The episode pulled and he can't post for a week. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7841.84s)]
*  And it's a strike against his account. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7844.2s)]
*  And it's all based on the actual Holocaust line, for sure. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7846.36s)]
*  It has to be. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7849.12s)]
*  But she's she's Jewish. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7850.08s)]
*  She is. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7852.32s)]
*  It's obvious she's Jewish. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7853.12s)]
*  She's always been Jewish. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7854.5199999999995s)]
*  It's also obvious if you're listening that when she says, yeah, that the Holocaust [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7855.48s)]
*  and that like that many Jews should die and that she said it after she said this [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7860.2s)]
*  thing where she's clearly she's clearly poking fun at Biden saying. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7864.96s)]
*  But by the way, I think you can make 81 million if you win those counties. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7869.32s)]
*  I don't know the math. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7874.72s)]
*  I don't know the math. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7875.96s)]
*  So is that is that real? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7877.52s)]
*  Like, what is the how many counties did Biden win? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7880.04s)]
*  Does it matter? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7882.68s)]
*  Look, if you don't think that people voted for Biden because they hated Trump [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7883.72s)]
*  and that 81 million people hated Trump, you're not paying attention. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7887.24s)]
*  Yes, it's it's like, I don't know if there was some shenanigans with the election. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7890.24s)]
*  I guarantee you it wasn't zero percent. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7894.36s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you said, like, how much voter fraud was it? [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7897.08s)]
*  It's never zero. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7899.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's never zero. That's right. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7901.08s)]
*  Ever. It's never zero. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7902.639999999999s)]
*  But it's also in. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7904.04s)]
*  I mean, if you do all the research that you can, the valid studies and the reports, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7906.16s)]
*  even from like hardcore pro Republican counties, it's it's like fractional voter fraud. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7911.92s)]
*  People like to write. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7919.599999999999s)]
*  It's probably zealots that work inside the organization that figured out a way to like, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7920.8s)]
*  oh, this county's got us. Let's hide. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7927.84s)]
*  It's not substantial. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7930.28s)]
*  It was a very small amount of counties. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7931.76s)]
*  I don't know about 36 being accurate. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7934.12s)]
*  OK, so with over 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes of any [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7935.56s)]
*  presidential candidate in history is also true that he won a record low number of counties. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7939.0s)]
*  But counties vary by population size from those with a few hundred people to those [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7943.88s)]
*  to others with millions of residents. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7948.84s)]
*  So county wins don't correlate with popular vote. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7951.08s)]
*  Right. But if you only win 30, if you have 81 million votes and 31 counties, how many 36 counties? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7955.320000000001s)]
*  That's what she was saying. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7963.6s)]
*  And this it says that he won four hundred seventy seven counties and Trump won two thousand. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7964.8s)]
*  Oh, so he won four hundred seventy seven. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7968.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot more than 31. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7971.12s)]
*  It's different than what she was saying. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7972.92s)]
*  OK. So why was she saying that? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7974.12s)]
*  She probably got just that information wrong. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7976.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7978.92s)]
*  Oh, so he won 509 counties. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7979.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a lot of counties. That makes sense. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7983.28s)]
*  Look, I know people that voted for Biden that wish they didn't now. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7985.16s)]
*  Yeah. But I do know a lot of people voted for Biden. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7989.04s)]
*  I don't know whether or not. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7992.96s)]
*  Look, there's some real problems with these voting machines. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=7996.24s)]
*  I mean, the other thing that that article saying right there that you're looking at [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8000.32s)]
*  is that Trump won like 2400 counties. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8003.2s)]
*  Right. So it's substantially higher number of counties. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8006.04s)]
*  But he's also winning a lot of those counties in like rural. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8008.64s)]
*  Rural. Yeah. Yeah. Like they were saying. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8011.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But there was a thing that they just released about the Dominion voting system, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8013.280000000001s)]
*  that it's susceptible to being hacked. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8018.56s)]
*  What was that? See if you can find that. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8021.84s)]
*  There's something something that just got released about the Dominion system. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8024.92s)]
*  I tell you about when we got one, by the way, YouTube struck us. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8028.04s)]
*  You guys for what? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8031.72s)]
*  We had a guest on this is like an old podcast. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8033.08s)]
*  This is like a couple of years ago. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8036.4s)]
*  And the guest, I think it was Derek Del Guido. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8038.36s)]
*  I think that's how you say his name. I don't want to get it wrong. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8041.879999999999s)]
*  But he was telling me about growing up and how he was getting taunted at school. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8043.5199999999995s)]
*  This is like a serious conversation. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8049.24s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, you know, getting bullied at school. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8051.92s)]
*  Kids are calling me a fag, blah, blah, blah. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8054.96s)]
*  Took the episode down. Hate speech. Wow. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8058.4s)]
*  I was like, but he's telling the story about being bullied. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8060.5199999999995s)]

*  Ohio became the poster child for bad election administration when two [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8253.439999999999s)]

*  The county lost 812 voter access cards that allowed a voter to cast a ballot [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8264.759999999998s)]
*  on machines. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8269.8s)]

*  where the votes are stored on the machines. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8274.48s)]

*  Cleveland, Cuyahoga County is Cleveland. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8293.4s)]
*  So so there was a there was a documentary that HBO had on called Hacking [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8295.96s)]
*  Democracy, and it was about the Diebold machines. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8301.359999999999s)]

*  I think they made ATMs, too, because I remember seeing an ATM machine [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8310.839999999998s)]
*  and thinking about that that documentary. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8314.96s)]
*  But there was they showed in the documentary that the machines [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8317.160000000002s)]
*  were exploitable by a third party and that there was a third party access. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8321.560000000001s)]
*  It's like a third party could alter the vote. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8326.92s)]
*  And they altered the vote on the machine, on the show, on the show, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8329.68s)]
*  on the show, how they did it. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8333.720000000001s)]
*  But we didn't have like widespread abuse of this in the last election. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8334.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, from everything that I've read and seen, like there's [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8340.12s)]
*  it's not been reported that this is even from, like I'm saying, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8343.6s)]
*  from Republican counties. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8346.36s)]
*  It's not something that I've heard where it's compelling enough to me [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8347.800000000001s)]
*  to say that I know that that's what happened. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8350.52s)]
*  Yeah. U.S. finds no evidence flaws in Dominion voting machines were ever exploited. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8352.28s)]
*  Well, they're really good at exploiting it. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8358.36s)]
*  Would you know that you got exploited? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8360.04s)]
*  And if you were exploited, would you tell everybody they're exploited? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8361.44s)]
*  And Trump should have actually won when that guy's been screaming [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8364.04s)]

*  that is already a problem. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8600.28s)]
*  And that's public belief in mainstream media. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8601.800000000001s)]

*  and not strengthen this one side to fight against the other side. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8653.52s)]
*  But bring everybody together. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8657.12s)]
*  Sure. Make everybody realize our differences are so small [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8658.720000000001s)]

*  The things that will help everyone's life. Yeah. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8666.04s)]
*  And then we have to think that way. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8668.400000000001s)]
*  We have to think as a collective group. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8669.6s)]
*  We have to think of as a community. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8671.04s)]
*  A lot of people just don't want to think that somebody can have [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8672.560000000001s)]
*  differing points of view about a range of topics. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8676.36s)]
*  Yep. So they go like, oh, if you are pro gun, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8678.960000000001s)]

*  And you're like, not everybody really falls into that. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8686.12s)]
*  No. People have all different types of points of views about [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8688.84s)]
*  it can be about any number of things like it can be like fiscally, [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8692.08s)]
*  you know, like how the government should spend money. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8695.560000000001s)]
*  It could be about your civil rights. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8697.92s)]
*  It can be. Yeah, it can be guns and abortion. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8699.68s)]
*  But those are that's not what defines people. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8701.44s)]
*  No, it shouldn't. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8703.92s)]
*  But it does because there's these predetermined [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8704.76s)]
*  patterns of thinking and ideas that people adopt when they join an ideology, [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8708.480000000001s)]
*  whether they join a progressive ideology or a conservative ideology. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8713.36s)]
*  Yeah. In order to be in the group, you have to espouse a certain amount of things. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8716.6s)]
*  And I see people say when they might not even believe it. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8720.28s)]
*  That's the big one. Yeah. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8722.960000000001s)]
*  That's the one that actually is kind of the most disheartening. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8724.36s)]
*  Yeah. Is when you talk to somebody, you can see it in person. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8727.36s)]
*  And they're just saying the right thing. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8730.84s)]
*  Yep. Like this is this is in this is what my group says to say. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8732.720000000001s)]
*  And you can just look them in the eyes like you don't even believe [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8736.400000000001s)]
*  what you're saying right now. Yeah. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8738.960000000001s)]
*  The real one with me is Republicans and gay rights. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8740.92s)]
*  The people that are anti gay rights that are Republican. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8744.6s)]
*  Yeah. They think that all gay people are groomers. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8747.92s)]
*  No, some people are just people who love people of the same sex. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8750.16s)]
*  Yeah. That that is always what makes them come. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8754.36s)]
*  That's the only thing about them. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8756.800000000001s)]
*  Well, and they're in love. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8758.44s)]
*  No, but I'm saying when you go like, what's at the foundation of this? [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8760.0s)]
*  It's that what arouses somebody is just different than what arouses you. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8762.960000000001s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. And they've existed throughout history. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8766.64s)]
*  Yeah. The idea that there's something wrong with that [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8769.92s)]
*  just because you don't like it. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8772.0s)]
*  Yeah. That to me is nuts from the people that are supposed to be about [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8773.2s)]
*  personal choice and freedom. Yeah. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8777.08s)]
*  That's what drives me. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8779.36s)]
*  And you don't think that like somebody else deserves to. Yeah. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8780.32s)]
*  Be in love with who they love. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8784.0s)]
*  Well, just imagine if and come super hard inside of them. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8785.52s)]
*  Yeah. But imagine if it was the gay thing that you had to do. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8788.56s)]
*  And heterosexuality was rare. Yeah. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8792.960000000001s)]
*  And heterosexuality is like, look at these fucking losers. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8795.44s)]
*  Breeding. What are you going to have a baby? [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8798.36s)]
*  You fucking idiots. Yeah. Like, oh, my God. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8800.28s)]
*  Like, you know, that would be horrible. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8802.560000000001s)]
*  That's exactly what it's like. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8805.0s)]
*  If you're gay, that's the difference. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8806.2s)]
*  No, it's crazy that we're even having that conversation. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8808.44s)]
*  They feel like they have to have that. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8810.76s)]
*  Some some people, especially if they want to attract the religious people, [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8812.68s)]
*  the very like devout Christians. Yeah. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8817.960000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that feel like they're still hanging on to that. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8820.76s)]
*  You have to take. Yeah. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8823.28s)]
*  Is the dumbest stance ever. It really is. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8824.6s)]
*  It just doesn't make any sense. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8826.68s)]
*  They should be everybody in every community should be judged on an individual basis. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8828.64s)]
*  You shouldn't say, oh, the straight people do this. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8833.6s)]
*  The gays do that. Like, that's stupid. Yeah. That's stupid. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8836.44s)]
*  And to say you don't want them to have the same rights that you have. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8839.44s)]
*  That's bananas. Yeah, that even exists. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8842.960000000001s)]

*  The people are talking about rescinding gay marriage. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8847.84s)]
*  Now that they got rid of Roe v. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8850.2s)]
*  Way, they're talking about getting it like, what are you out of your fucking mind? [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8851.36s)]
*  What does that get you? [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8853.84s)]
*  I think it's one of those things like we were talking about before. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8854.84s)]
*  Like if you were a conspiracy theorist, you wanted people to be upset about things. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8857.92s)]
*  It's one more social distraction. It's a giant distraction. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8861.0s)]
*  And now you're not paying attention to things that matter. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8864.04s)]
*  It's a giant distraction. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8866.04s)]
*  And anybody that wants to argue that they should be forced to argue [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8867.28s)]
*  with someone who makes this rational sort of argument against it. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8871.24s)]
*  That's it's stupid. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8875.44s)]
*  It's stupid from a perspective of someone who values freedom. Yeah. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=8876.68s)]

*  It looks like you said, oh, my God, it says in total, [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9175.12s)]
*  he gambled away a total of eighty two thousand euros. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9177.84s)]
*  So he still only made 80 grand, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9180.400000000001s)]

*  what was going on at first. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9199.32s)]
*  But his behavior turned to normal when he stumbled upon a website [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9200.48s)]
*  that made the link between reequip and addictions in 2005. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9204.32s)]
*  And he stopped taking the drug. He said, my life was hell. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9207.8s)]
*  It still is because you cannot forget a catastrophe like that. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9211.0s)]
*  Look at his face. That's you can't fake that. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9214.24s)]

*  is like you're betting against the table a lot, too, because I think it hits [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9774.76s)]
*  if it's seven or 11 and that's craps. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Fy5kpTaja8&t=9778.0s)]
