# Joe Rogan Experience #2194 - Luis Elizondo
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gLPtRwXgCM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's up Luke?
*  How are you?
*  Hey sir, I'm doing better than I deserve.
*  Well, that's a good statement.
*  There's an old military saying any day above ground is a good day.
*  There you go.
*  So tell everybody what your official job was.
*  Wow.
*  I had a lot of official jobs.
*  With the government in regards to, you know.
*  You know.
*  You know, those things.
*  Sure.
*  One of these things.
*  That's a, allegedly, that's a replica of the one that Bob Luzar worked on, the sport model.
*  I've heard that before.
*  Designs by Perry.
*  The E in Perry is a three and he's a dude on Instagram that sent me that.
*  Very cool.
*  Pretty dope, right?
*  We have another one that looks just like it at the mothership at the comedy club.
*  When you walk in, you walk right through like a giant suspended UFO.
*  Very cool.
*  So obviously I have issues.
*  Well, you know what?
*  This is a neat town.
*  I was strolling the streets yesterday and I came across the Texas Toy Museum.
*  Now I'm not one for museums usually, but something I saw was automatically transported me back
*  to when I was a kid.
*  I'm an old guy, so I grew up 70s and early 80s.
*  How old are you?
*  52.
*  I'm 57.
*  You are?
*  Yeah.
*  Man.
*  Well, I look 10 years older than you.
*  I got a lot of long, hard miles on me, unfortunately.
*  I do too, believe it or not.
*  Well, you'll have to share with me your secret because unfortunately I tell people this is
*  as good as it gets.
*  I'm about as attractive as a cement truck, you know.
*  So after the Army, I went into the Federal Service and had a lot of jobs, mostly in counterintelligence,
*  which is looking basically what the bad guys know about us from an intelligence perspective.
*  And in 2008, I changed my job.
*  One of my jobs, I was working at the Director of National Intelligence, which for most people
*  may or may not know.
*  It's kind of outside of D.C. and where I lived, I was on the other side of D.C. living on
*  a little island in the Chesapeake Bay.
*  So my commute was terrible.
*  I mean, it really, really frankly.
*  Did you have to take a ferry every day?
*  No, but it was about a three hour commute each way.
*  You have to go right past Langley.
*  Why didn't you move closer?
*  Well, you know, I wanted to give my kids a really good quality of life and I did not
*  want to work in the city and then kind of expose them to kind of the craziness, if that
*  makes sense.
*  Especially D.C.
*  D.C. is crazy.
*  Especially with kids, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Kind of nuts that they don't clean up the capital of the fucking country.
*  You know, brother, it's kind of indicative of the rot the whole country is involved in.
*  It's such a disgrace because you bring in these foreign dignitaries and the first thing
*  they see is just the dereliction of it.
*  And it's a very poor reflection on really what the American spirit is about.
*  But you know, that's for another conversation.
*  It seems like they could fix that.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially in that place.
*  Yeah, one would hope, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus Christ, it's the nation's capital.
*  Yeah.
*  So I was offered a job to go back to the Pentagon in 2008 for a little while and basically run
*  the integration between national level intelligence information and local and state and tribal
*  law enforcement.
*  So after 9-11, the country realized that we had a significant problem getting national
*  level information down to the cops on the ground that could actually do something about
*  it.
*  Why?
*  Because he didn't have security clearances.
*  So they couldn't, they weren't allowed to be provided that information.
*  So one of my jobs was to try to help fix that.
*  And shortly thereafter, I got there in 2008.
*  It was probably early 2009 is when I was approached by two individuals who came to me and they
*  said, look, we'd like to consider you for a program that we're part of.
*  It's a very nuanced program, very secretive program.
*  Now when you're in the government, you hear that all the time.
*  It's not, you know, people look at maybe they tell you have a secret clearance or a top
*  secret clearance.
*  Millions of people have some sort of security clearance in the government and a lot, a lot
*  of people have a top secret clearance.
*  So it's really not that uncommon.
*  It's really not that sexy.
*  So you didn't really know what you're getting involved in?
*  I didn't at all.
*  Not at all.
*  In fact, so yeah, great question.
*  So no, I didn't know what I was getting involved in.
*  And after several conversations, it occurred to me that their interest in me was some of
*  my background I had in my early career as a special agent in counterintelligence.
*  I was protecting technologies, critical technologies, critical avionic technologies, for example,
*  and some aerospace technology.
*  So think of first stage solid rocket motor booster technology, Tomahawk cruise missiles,
*  stuff like that, Apache longbow.
*  So advanced avionics was something I was kind of already familiar with.
*  And at the same time, I had the counterintelligence background.
*  So I was asked to come in and run the counterintelligence and security aspect for a particular program,
*  at which time I had no idea what the program even was.
*  So what does counterintelligence and security mean?
*  It just simply means making sure that our adversaries like Russia and China can't penetrate
*  our organization and steal our secret.
*  That's all it is.
*  It's kind of a fancy word for just saying security, information security and operational
*  security.
*  So I remember I had a meeting.
*  They brought me to go see their director.
*  And it was in a, I would tell you the location, but I was told by the Pentagon not to say
*  the specific location of this office.
*  But it was somewhere in the DC area.
*  It was a facility that wasn't known publicly to be an intelligence, to have an intelligence
*  office in there.
*  So I can't say the specific location.
*  But I went there and I went up to the top floor.
*  I think it was the top floor, almost the top floor.
*  And I met for the first time a gentleman named James Lukatsky, Dr. James Lukatsky, PhD.
*  And this guy was the epitome of a rocket scientist.
*  And when I say the epitome, I mean, he was probably, and there's no exaggeration, the
*  number one rocket scientist in the US government.
*  Now he's a humble guy, so he'll probably tell you he wasn't, but he really was an amazing
*  human being and very smart.
*  And after a very brief conversation, he looked at me and he said, I want to ask you a question.
*  Okay, sir.
*  And he said, what do you think about UFOs?
*  I said, well, I answer truthfully.
*  I said, I don't.
*  And he said, well, what do you mean?
*  You don't believe in them?
*  And I said, no, that's not what I said.
*  You asked me if I think, what do I think about UFOs?
*  And frankly, I don't think about UFOs.
*  I really don't have the luxury to think about them.
*  Too busy, you know, working intelligence operations and whatnot.
*  And I remember him looking over his glasses and very seriously staring me straight in
*  the eye and says, well, don't let your personal bias get the best of you because what you
*  may learn may surprise you and may challenge any preconceived notion of what you think
*  something is or is not.
*  And so let me backtrack for a minute.
*  I've never been a UFO guy.
*  People come up and go, you're that UFO guy.
*  I'm really not.
*  I was never really into science fiction as a kid.
*  I wasn't into the Star Trek or the Star Wars like a lot of people were.
*  So that was not my disposition.
*  I grew up, I guess, playing G.I.
*  Joe and stuff like that.
*  So that wasn't that wasn't my background.
*  And certainly in college, I studied microbiology and immunology with a focus on
*  parasitology, not parapsychology, the study of parasites, parasitology.
*  So the scientific method has always been something that has been near and dear to me.
*  And then, of course, later on as a as a special agent, you know, that when you're
*  when you're conducting investigations, for me, I was always very fact driven, kind of
*  the old gum shoe, if you will, just the facts, ma'am sort of guy.
*  So I was never really prone to any type of, if you will, affinity towards science
*  fiction or even the UFO topic.
*  I just I just never really considered it.
*  Hmm. So he says this to you.
*  And then so we're talking about like, what, 16 years ago, 15, 16 years ago.
*  Yeah, I do the math, right.
*  So it's twenty, twenty four, 2000, early 2009.
*  So this is the beginning of your journey towards this sort of bizarre subject of
*  whatever these things are.
*  Yeah. So you don't have any real previous interest.
*  He says this to you.
*  And and then what's the steps after that?
*  Like, how do you get introduced to this idea that these things are alien crafts?
*  Yeah. So great question.
*  So for some people, there's kind of two ways people process this information, at
*  least in my experience, and there may be others.
*  This has just been my my observation.
*  Some people have this kind of revelatory moment, this epiphany where it's this moment
*  where, oh, my gosh, this is real.
*  Right.
*  For other people, it's kind of more of a slow, gradual realization.
*  And I think for me, I was probably in the second category, more of a slow, gradual
*  realization that this isn't a cover for something else.
*  This is really about UFOs.
*  So how do you first get introduced to these things?
*  Well, so it was I didn't get introduced to these things.
*  It was first of all, I was introduced to the reporting.
*  Right. So there was these these official reports that we were getting from the
*  field. There's official videos and whatnot.
*  That describe vehicles doing things, maneuvering in ways that, frankly, outperform
*  anything we have in our inventory.
*  Now, keep in mind, my background was at some point in aerospace.
*  So I knew all the capabilities of an F-16 or, for example, an F-22 or the F-35.
*  And at the end of the day, as advanced as they are, they're still conventional
*  aircraft. You know, they still have the old there's a there's an adage they use
*  for jet engines. It may seem a little awkward here, but it's suck, squeeze, bang
*  and blow. That's what a jet engine does.
*  Forgive me. That's what it does.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  It's a convention, conventional type engine.
*  Of course, you have a propeller too that can can displace air and whatnot.
*  These vehicles are different.
*  These vehicles, for the most part, didn't have any type of associated
*  characteristic that you or I or any normal person would associate with with the
*  plane, with an airplane aircraft.
*  Right. But and yet it's flying.
*  So how does an airplane work?
*  Well, let's say this cigar, for example, is an airplane and there's four
*  fundamental forces.
*  And so you have thrust, lift, drag and weight.
*  And if you understand those, you can create build wings and you create lift
*  and you can fly. And then you have to have an engine for that thrust and whatnot.
*  The things that our military pilots were encountering didn't have that.
*  They didn't have wings.
*  They didn't have rudders and ailerons and control surfaces.
*  They didn't have cockpits.
*  They didn't have engines and no obvious signs of propulsion.
*  They were they were doing things and maneuvering in ways that, frankly,
*  defied anything that that we had in our inventory.
*  And we were pretty certain the enemies didn't have either.
*  Our adversary didn't have these technologies either.
*  And even more perplexing is that they were being encountered over controlled
*  U.S. airspace and over sensitive military installations.
*  So, you know, from that perspective, you've got a real you've got a real
*  national security concern on your hands.
*  So you said video.
*  What was the do you remember the first thing that you saw?
*  Boy, there's so many.
*  You know, I think part of the challenge is that most people here in this country,
*  they're familiar with the three videos, right, that have been famously released
*  by the Pentagon, the go fast, go fast, gimbal, flier.
*  Correct. Right.
*  But those are those are the least compelling of all the videos that the government has.
*  Those were unclassified.
*  And so those were the ones which are kind of the low hanging fruit
*  that could be released to the general public.
*  There's stuff out there that's like 4K ultra high definition.
*  Right. So when you see something like that from a certain military platform
*  or a certain military equity or an intelligence collection platform,
*  you have to look at that and say, well, what what is that?
*  What the hell is that?
*  And more importantly, that data is being backed up by radar data.
*  Right. So you've got you've got electro optical data like gun camera
*  footage or pod or FLIR FLIR video.
*  And then you've got radar data that's that's that is actually confirming
*  what the video is picking up.
*  And then you've got eyewitnesses that are also watching it.
*  Right. So you've got trained, trained observers, pilots that that can recognize
*  the silhouette between an SU-22 and a MIG-25 from 20 miles away
*  and make a split second decision.
*  Is it friend or foe? Do I kill it or is it do I let it live?
*  And they're reporting it.
*  So you have now three separate, if you will, collection platforms
*  the human eye being one of them.
*  You've got gun camera footage and you've got radar footage.
*  All describing the same event at the same place, at the same time,
*  under the same circumstances. Right.
*  And so keep in mind with my background as a former special agent
*  and counterintelligence, if this was in front of a jury, you know,
*  as I said before, I think we're well beyond reasonable doubt.
*  That's that is something there.
*  I mean, that is real.
*  That's not an atmospheric aberration.
*  It's not a, you know, anomaly.
*  That is that is something there. It's tangible.
*  So was there an aha moment for you?
*  Like the first thing that you saw that you looked at and you go.
*  What the fuck?
*  No, like I said, for me, it was more slow and gradual.
*  I didn't. What was the first thing that you saw that made you realize
*  that there's something going on here that defies conventional wisdom
*  or conventional understanding of propulsion systems?
*  I think for me, one of the most compelling moments was when I attended.
*  Well, let me go back in memory banks.
*  I attended a dinner with some individuals who were already associated
*  with the larger umbrella program called ASAP.
*  And I attended dinner at a Washington, D.C.
*  hotel and a Brazilian general attended this this dinner.
*  And the dinner was sponsored by a gentleman named Robert Bigelow,
*  the famous billionaire hotel.
*  Yeah, I've met him. Yeah.
*  I met him on the podcast. Yeah.
*  And by the way, he's he's an American hero.
*  He's a patriot. He's really he is brilliant.
*  And he's and people don't realize that he funded,
*  self-funded a lot of this stuff on behalf of the U.S.
*  government for by himself.
*  Like he paid it to do it himself.
*  He really is a, you know, an American patriot, in my opinion.
*  But anyways, he flew in this guy named General Uchoa.
*  General Uchoa was a Brazilian general,
*  very, very senior in the Brazilian government who led an investigation
*  about a an event that occurred over several days.
*  This is the Virginia incident.
*  No, it's actually called Colares.
*  Oh, another one in Brazil.
*  Yeah. And the Colares incident.
*  And they had an overwhelming number of eyewitnesses.
*  And there was even some some video and photographs
*  that they had produced internally there to Brazil.
*  And it was overwhelming, the evidence.
*  And for me, that was it was more listening to him
*  and explain the concern they had and some of the interactions
*  the Brazilian government officials had with these UAP that really
*  I left there that that dinner scratching my head and really
*  at that point beginning to absorb the profoundness that we're
*  dealing with something that like is real.
*  This is not a cover plan for some other technology we're trying to protect.
*  Did he show you this video evidence?
*  So he was it was I was sitting at the kind of like a table like this.
*  There was a whole lot of people at the table.
*  He was sitting at the head.
*  That was kind of way down over here.
*  And he brought a manila envelope and he was showing photographs to everybody.
*  Right. And some reporting as well.
*  I think he brought, if I recall correctly, his daughter to translate
*  because I don't think English was very good.
*  It wasn't his language.
*  But for me, that was and I think for one of my colleagues, too,
*  which I probably can't say his name right now because he hasn't come out publicly yet.
*  But we both left that dinner.
*  I think scratching our heads and saying, wow, this is so this is legit.
*  This is real. The U.S. government is interested in this.
*  And there is interest by our government.
*  As after that dinner, attending more meetings and beginning to read the reports,
*  the field reports and speaking to the scientists,
*  it became evident to me that this was a very serious issue.
*  We had near misses over some of our our our areas of operation.
*  In some cases, literally these these UAP splitting a combat formation.
*  Now, if you know how planes fly, they fly very close in a combat situation.
*  These things were splitting the formation, right?
*  That that there were reports being being provided through the Air Force,
*  mostly through the Navy, about air safety issues
*  where pilots literally could run into these things.
*  Right. They were they're they're pervasive.
*  It wasn't like a onesie and twosies.
*  Was there ever an incident where a pilot or a jet did run into something?
*  Not that I'm aware of what I can tell you, that there has been incidents
*  where there appears to be some sort of provocation, where
*  one of these things seems to be coming deliberately close to an aircraft,
*  not necessarily trying to hit it,
*  but maybe trying to demonstrate performance capabilities.
*  There was one video in particular
*  having been cleared by the Pentagon.
*  So let me see if I can speak about it in general terms.
*  There's a pilot flying and a a a you can hear on the radio
*  this chatter back and forth.
*  Do you see it? You have eyes down on it.
*  Pilot. Nope. Negative. No eyes down.
*  OK, should I want to write?
*  Yeah, I got something on radar, but no eyes.
*  And I can't see it.
*  And then all of a sudden, a craft,
*  an object goes whizzing right by the cockpit.
*  And I mean, probably like 15 feet away.
*  And you can hear the pilot, the expletives of the pilot.
*  You know, I won't say it here on air, but you can imagine, right,
*  what what a pilot would say when they're very, very surprised.
*  That was one there.
*  Can you describe what he saw?
*  I think I can. I want to be careful that I don't.
*  Because again, I haven't had what I what I have approval to talk about.
*  I've I've spoken about.
*  Let me preface by saying I still have my security clearance.
*  And on occasion, I still will consult for the U.S. government.
*  And so I want to be very mindful.
*  I have no problem going up all the way to the line. Right.
*  Understood. But if I put up, you know, a pinky toe over that line there.
*  Right, right, right. Of course.
*  But it was a wedge shaped craft, wedge shaped, wedge shaped,
*  like triangular. But
*  yeah, like a wedge, like I don't know how to describe it.
*  I could draw it for you if you want.
*  Sure, you can. Yeah.
*  So just like a wedge that you would like split wood with,
*  like that kind of a wedge.
*  Yeah, but it was it was silver metallic and like a like a diamond.
*  Maybe that's a better way to describe it, like a diamond almost.
*  And it looked kind of like it looked kind of like that.
*  Really is just a just a little.
*  And that that kind of shape is something that's been reported multiple times.
*  So that was the first time I ever saw something like that.
*  To me, it was keep in mind, I I never followed this topic.
*  So every time I'm seeing one of these videos,
*  I'm kind of seeing something for the very first time.
*  So lenticular, whether it's a disc shaped craft or it's it's a wedge shaped craft
*  or a diamond shaped craft or triangle shaped craft boomerang in some cases.
*  These were all new to me.
*  So it was very, very perplexing.
*  And obviously, to our military pilots, it was very concerning.
*  And I think when you when you look at some of the gold standard cases
*  we had, like the Nimitz, for example, that that that case,
*  you know, you have this overwhelming number of sensors
*  looking at the same thing going on that the pilots are reporting.
*  And for me, that was most compelling, like I said, more than
*  eyewitness testimony is important.
*  But at the end of the day, you know, grandma seeing some lights in her backyard
*  doesn't really do it for me.
*  You know, I'm a fact oriented kind of guy.
*  I've got to see the data, let the data.
*  Provide us the information we need so then we can make a conclusion.
*  Right. I'm not, you know, if you start seeing UFOs in the sky everywhere,
*  well, chances are they're probably not, you know, it was a quadcopter,
*  it's a balloon, it's an aircraft, it could be all sorts of things.
*  That's why I think from our perspective, having the fundamental categories,
*  the observables, we call them, was so important because they are so
*  beyond what what a normal aircraft, a traditional conventional aircraft can do.
*  At that point, you realize you're dealing with some some sort of beyond
*  next generation technology, and that's when it gets compelling for guys like me.
*  Right. Right. When you're when you're seeing when you're seeing
*  performance capabilities that far exceed far surpass anything we have.
*  And I'm talking even the very, very best technology we have.
*  We don't come close to that.
*  And no visible means of propulsion.
*  No. Or obvious signs of lift.
*  Right. And not even a cockpit.
*  You have to scratch your head and see what's going on.
*  Interestingly, I share. So no windows.
*  No windows. Well, in some cases, no windows.
*  Other cases, people will report what they think are windows.
*  They say, oh, I saw windows.
*  But at the end of the day, you know, we're we're we're looking
*  that in terms of what we think a window is. Right. Right.
*  See a car, you see windows or plane. Those are windows.
*  I didn't see any information to suggest that there were actually windows,
*  even though an eyewitness might describe a window,
*  because we are describing in something of something that we recognize. Right.
*  And so we say, oh, that might be a window or not.
*  But it might not be a window.
*  And so I want to be very careful to to say there were no windows.
*  There could have been.
*  But the ones that I was privy to that I saw, I didn't see any obvious
*  signs of like a windshield or a window.
*  I didn't see anything like that.
*  I saw vehicles that were doing things that were were
*  just left you scratching your head.
*  And they were real, like I said, because you're you're
*  backing it up with all this other sensor data and some of the best
*  sophisticated sensor data, by the way, at the time on the planet
*  that we had, right, like the spy one radar and the two Hawkeye
*  and and some of the other radar capabilities and technical capabilities
*  that other intelligence agencies have that I can't discuss here.
*  You know that this this is the stuff that that helps us put
*  forgive the analogy here, but warheads on foreheads.
*  We when we're going to take a strike against a terrorist,
*  these are the same sensor systems we use to to to prosecute that war,
*  that that that act
*  both in combat and not in combat.
*  So yeah, that's that for me was was was very compelling.
*  And it's lots and lots of videos.
*  People think that there's only three videos.
*  There's there's those are those those don't even scratch the surface.
*  There are hundreds and hundreds of videos that that the intelligence
*  community and the Department of Defense have on these things.
*  Has there ever been any discussion about releasing any of these?
*  I don't want to speak on behalf of the government. I
*  colleagues of mine, like Chris Mellon, who have been very, very, very active
*  in this topic and have actually been responsible for a lot of what we see
*  now happening in Congress has been championing that.
*  He is the one who says, look, we need more videos to come out
*  so the American people can see for themselves what we've been dealing with.
*  When I had Chris Mellon in the Pentagon, he saw those videos.
*  And up to that point, he you know, he had been when he was a senior person
*  at the Pentagon, like very senior, one of his jobs as the senior
*  intelligence official, he asked, hey, do we have any UAP, UFO
*  videos, investigations, anything like that? And he told him no.
*  So when he came to the Pentagon and saw what we actually did have,
*  you can imagine someone like Chris Mellon, right?
*  He wasn't very happy.
*  He was he was actually pretty, pretty disappointed saying, why?
*  Why was I told no, I can I can see these videos clearly.
*  I see the reports.
*  Clearly, this is something that we're interested in as a Department of Defense.
*  And yet, when I was one of the senior guys, he got the Heisman, right?
*  He was he was being told no.
*  And so that's that was, I think, a point for him that really
*  that's probably the I don't want to speak for my friend, Chris, but I
*  suspect that was probably the spark that got him to the point where he said,
*  OK, we have to do something about this.
*  This is this is this is BS.
*  Yeah. When I was talking to him, it seemed like that was his perspective,
*  that this was something that really should be,
*  and at least in some way, shape or form, released to the general public,
*  just to solidify the conversation, just to let people know like these are real.
*  This is a real thing. These are not just if you've seen the one that
*  people were filming just a couple of days ago in Palmdale,
*  California. Yeah, I think they said those were drones.
*  So if I'm not mistaken, I think the jury came out.
*  If I'm not mistaken, I could be wrong that it was a it was somebody
*  using drones with some LED lights, which, by the way, wild things with drones.
*  Now, you absolutely can't create images in the sky.
*  One hundred percent dragons and stuff with. Yeah, absolutely.
*  So, you know, we have to be careful as our own technology begins to advance.
*  There's going to be pranksters out there. Right.
*  You know, and that's one of the things that for me in ATIP,
*  I always went into an investigation or a case assuming that it was manmade.
*  Right. And until I saw the compelling data that said otherwise,
*  we were always going to assume or presume that this was something
*  that was conventional. It was probably misidentified,
*  but it wasn't it wasn't exotic.
*  And then once the data suggests otherwise,
*  then you kind of go into that that that other motive.
*  OK, now what what are we dealing with again,
*  especially on the backdrop of the five performance observables?
*  That's when you start to say, OK, yeah, this is this is not a
*  this is not an F-16.
*  You know, this is not a this is not a Chinese aircraft.
*  This is this is something different. Right.
*  What is the oldest video footage or film footage
*  that you have ever seen or heard civilian or military?
*  Does not like what is the oldest where it's like, OK, what the fuck is this?
*  What's the oldest stuff that's compelling?
*  Because the point is what I'm trying to get at is a lot of people
*  point to the possibility that there's some sort of a secret program,
*  some sort of secret propulsion, gravity based, whatever it is,
*  that's completely different than conventional propulsion systems
*  that the U.S. government has and that they're operating these drones.
*  And the problem with that is always the like
*  the Kenneth Arnold sightings, the Roswell, the sightings from a time
*  where that technology just wasn't available at all.
*  Joe, I'm so glad you asked me that question.
*  It just so happens I brought you something. Oh, I brought you.
*  Glasses come out, you know, serious.
*  No, it just means it means I'm old.
*  Me too. Yeah.
*  I'm going to provide you a document here.
*  It's a it's a short document, but the portions, I think, are highlighted
*  that you're going to want to pay attention to.
*  And let's see here. OK.
*  So if this is just for you and if your audience is interested,
*  it's this paragraph here you're going to want to read.
*  And then it's the last one that's highlighted.
*  And then take a look at the date and the subject line.
*  This is it right here. Jamie brought it up here. Oh, great.
*  Yeah. So which one paragraph six right now.
*  So if you want to scroll down to paragraph six. OK.
*  This summary of observations of aerial phenomenon has been prepared
*  for the purpose of reemphasizing and reiterating the fact that the phenomena
*  have continuously occurred in the New Mexico skies
*  during the past 18 months and are continuing to occur.
*  And secondly, that these phenomena are occurring
*  in the vicinity of sensitive military and government installations.
*  And if you want to go back to like paragraph two, there you go.
*  The highlighted part. Yeah. The observers of the observers of those
*  phenomenon include scientists, special agents of the Office of Special
*  Investigations, the U.S. Air Force, airline pilots,
*  military pilots, Los Alamos security inspectors, military personnel
*  and many other persons of various occupations whose reliability is not questioned.
*  And now scroll to the top of the very top of that document.
*  It says that it was determined above that.
*  The summary of observations of aerial phenomenon in the New Mexico area,
*  December 1948 to May 1950.
*  And the date of that document, if you scroll a little bit higher,
*  you are going to see the date of that memo.
*  1950, May 25, 1950.
*  It says that the it was determined that the frequency of unexplained
*  aerial phenomena in the New Mexico area was such that an organized plan of.
*  Reporting these observations should be undertaken.
*  Right. So this is the beginning of Project Blue Book.
*  So this is the the recognition that we have a serious problem
*  over our sensitive military installations.
*  This is nothing new. This is not 1970s reverse
*  engineered technology or some sort of special technology.
*  1950, they're talking about.
*  We had just broken the sound barrier and we had not yet entered into space.
*  And we have these things that are performing in ways that, frankly,
*  we can't replicate.
*  I brought a few more of these later on to emphasize that point
*  you just brought up at some point, if you're interested.
*  Yeah. But it highlights that these are official government documents
*  through official government personnel
*  raising the alarm bells, just like we did in in in ASAP and ATIPS.
*  And so this is nothing new.
*  Now, if you want to look at this from an adversarial perspective,
*  let's our governors already said that's not ours.
*  Right. If you look at a 1950s saber jet, for example,
*  it wasn't even supersonic.
*  And yet these things that we are observing in some cases are doing
*  a bunch more documents here, multiples of of mock.
*  At at doing velocities and doing things that we frankly could not do back then.
*  And frankly, we still can't do in some cases.
*  But temporarily speaking, the only two countries in the world may
*  may have a chance of doing something like that would be Russia and China.
*  And now in 1950, where was China was in the middle of a famine
*  at the time and where was Russia?
*  Russia was trying to develop the atomic bomb
*  and still was using horse drawn carts for a lot of their military operations.
*  So temporally speaking, it doesn't make sense.
*  This is this is the analogy I've used before, Joe, that it would be like
*  Sir Carter going into King Tut's tomb for the very first time in the 1920s,
*  discovering King Tut's tomb.
*  And when he goes in, he finds a fully assembled 747 jet.
*  It doesn't make sense.
*  Temporarily speaking, they did not have that technology.
*  So is it possible?
*  And I'll be very careful what I say that the U.S.
*  government has some sort of exotic technology.
*  Well, my answer is I sure hope so, because, you know, we want to have
*  an advantage over our adversaries.
*  But in 1950, that wasn't the case. Right.
*  And do they have any film of these crafts from New Mexico?
*  There is film of many craft and not just New Mexico per se,
*  but over many military installation.
*  I got another one for you. I'll provide you.
*  You don't have to waste your time reading it.
*  But the I think you'll appreciate this.
*  Take a look at the date of this and who it's to and who it's from.
*  And I think you'll find the subject line very interesting.
*  OK, which one? What part of my reading here?
*  Just to highlight a portion.
*  So you can see the top of the document, who it's from,
*  who it's to in the date and what the subject line is.
*  Director of Special Investigate.
*  What does it say? It's hard because it's all scratchy.
*  Yeah, it's an old reproduction of official government documents.
*  Bottom line, it's a it's a document from J. Edgar Hoover.
*  Oh, I see.
*  From the director of the FBI,
*  Department of the Air Force, the Pentagon.
*  Yeah, J. Edgar Hoover, director of Federal Bureau of Investigations.
*  And the subject read the subject line of that memo.
*  Flying.
*  God, it's good.
*  It's hard to read because it's all screwy.
*  Flying disks, I should say, flying disks over the savanna.
*  It's there's a sensitive facility that we had where we were doing atomic
*  development.
*  Yeah, flying disks reportedly seen in the vicinity of something.
*  River plant.
*  Savannah River plant. Yes, sir. OK, that's correct.
*  And so that's just. Atomic energy.
*  Yeah. And the date of that being, you know, 1952. Right.
*  So so so this is an this is verified.
*  This is that was released by the government.
*  That is those are all official.
*  All these are official U.S.
*  government documentation that anybody can pull up anytime they want.
*  Did they let you see any of these ancient films, these films from the 1950s
*  of these things? So great question.
*  Our focus was really more modern time.
*  It was more like a picture of where we are now.
*  I mean, wouldn't you want to just like if you if you really think this thing is
*  from somewhere else, the best example of it definitely not being ours
*  is something from the 1950s.
*  Sure. And anecdotally, that that's that's great.
*  But keep in mind on the backdrop of national security, when you go to a general
*  and you clean this up, by the way, you crazy.
*  It's like half the things blotted out and scratching.
*  Yeah, that's Uncle Sam for you.
*  You know, when you go to a general or it makes me suspicious.
*  No, you can find that. I know, I know, I know.
*  But it was just like, yeah, the government released that.
*  I mean, they they admit that that's fucking shitty old 1920 fax machine.
*  Look at that. Well, they remember they were using typewriters back to write
*  and ink smears and yeah, blotchy.
*  And I'm sure the original is probably much, much cleaner.
*  But that's what the government put out online for people to review.
*  So when you're going back to your answer, your question,
*  when you are going to a general or you're going to a military leader
*  about this topic, if you go back to anecdotal stuff like, oh,
*  this is something from 1950s, they're not interested.
*  They're like, look, what is going on now? Right.
*  What is what is the threat now?
*  I've got a carrier strike group out in the water.
*  I'm getting reports.
*  These things are coming in and interrogating the ship.
*  You know what? I want to see that.
*  I want to see the videos. I want to see the reporting.
*  I want to see the deck logs and what the commander says.
*  And I want to the pilots want to talk to the pilots, the radar operators.
*  That's their focus. They're not interested.
*  And by the way, we've tried a few times.
*  And the further back in time we go, the less interested they were.
*  So it was really interesting.
*  Yeah, it was really the current information.
*  What's going on now? I'm not interested in what happened.
*  They're just taking a pragmatic approach. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And it's you know, it's understandable from a military perspective,
*  a national security perspective.
*  The other stuff is interesting.
*  And from the general public's perspective, you know, they're interested.
*  But from a national security perspective, they're like, hey, man,
*  that was three decades ago. Right.
*  I need I need now. So it is understandable.
*  A little frustrating because you want to you want to demonstrate.
*  Look, boss, this is this is nothing new.
*  You know, this is this is a repeated pattern that we're seeing here.
*  But they're more interested in the here and now.
*  So do they have repeated footage because you're seeing three decades?
*  But obviously, we're talking about 1950.
*  Do they have stuff from the 1980s, stuff from the 1990s?
*  There was reporting. Yeah.
*  And again, I got to be careful
*  because some of that stuff I haven't been clear to talk about.
*  But there there are reports
*  we call foreign intelligence, FI, foreign intelligence reports.
*  I can't say where or who or anything like that.
*  But on classified systems where we know without a shadow of a doubt,
*  UAPs were encountered in other countries, adversarial countries.
*  Why? Because we spy on them and we know again, I can't say how we know
*  and whatnot, because I get in trouble, but just.
*  So we know this is not a United States phenomenon.
*  Precisely. It is not a US only phenomenon.
*  And in fact, in other countries, whether it's in Latin America,
*  South America or in Europe or Russia, China,
*  there is an extreme interest in this topic.
*  In fact, the Chinese was in the newspaper.
*  I think it was a China Morning Sun.
*  There's something called the Five Continents Initiative,
*  where allegedly they were trying to broker a deal with the United Nations
*  that would allow China to run all the UFO investigations
*  for the United Nations. Right.
*  So we also know that Russia, they've come out and said,
*  yeah, we're interested in this topic.
*  There were some released old KGB footage that showed MIG interactions
*  with these UAP.
*  And there's also in Latin America, you have the same thing.
*  If you go to Latin America now, they don't have the same level of stigma
*  and taboo associated with this topic like we do.
*  And so they talk freely about it.
*  They have no problem talking.
*  In fact, when I was in in the Patagonia area of Argentina,
*  there is a near town called Bariloche and Las Lajas.
*  One of the chief of police was telling me that I have there's an area
*  there called La Miranda.
*  La Miranda means to see, to view.
*  And they call it that the town.
*  And because UAP are so frequent there, that local law enforcement
*  actually built an observatory, an observation post to look at these things
*  because they were so frequent.
*  So this is not a new phenomenon.
*  This is something that's been around for quite a long time.
*  The problem is, in my opinion, and I could be wrong, but this is my assessment.
*  The reason why it's so difficult to have the conversation here
*  is because our government had placed so much emphasis and interest
*  trying to stigmatize this topic that it almost worked too well.
*  Now we're at the point where we should be having this conversation
*  and people still don't want to because they think it's crazy.
*  You think of tinfoil hats and Elvis on the mothership.
*  But in reality, we're talking about a real national security issue.
*  I mean, these things are here.
*  You have Joe, you have a former director of National Intelligence, Radcliffe,
*  a former director of CIA.
*  Brennan, you have former presidents all coming out and saying,
*  yeah, there's something to it. It's real. Right.
*  Now, what it is, where it's from and all that stuff.
*  I'm not sure we're quite ready to go there yet.
*  But the acknowledgement is, hey, man, yeah, this is real.
*  It's not ours. And we probably should do something about it.
*  So if we go back to the history of the debunking of it, you know,
*  like the Project Blue Book stuff, Jay Allen Heineck,
*  after he had left Project Blue Book,
*  he became a proponent of UFO disclosure
*  during Project Blue Book.
*  He it was his job to essentially dismiss everything
*  and to come up with some sort of a reason, swamp gas,
*  mass hallucinations, whatever it was to attribute
*  all these sightings to something that was very easy to explain.
*  Did they ever is there any documentation
*  or any discussion of why they did that,
*  why they chose to debunk everything?
*  Yeah, my understanding is if you have to look at where America was
*  at the time they were doing these investigations,
*  it was at the height of the Cold War. Right.
*  And, you know, despite what some people think,
*  the Cold War wasn't very cold at all. It was pretty hot.
*  And we had Russia and the United States engaging in these proxy wars.
*  Neither side wanted to let the other side know
*  what we had and what we didn't know. Right.
*  So if you have these UAP coming in and out,
*  the last thing you want to do is tell the other side broadcast.
*  This is what we've learned from it.
*  And more importantly, this is what we don't know about it. Right.
*  And so both sides were keeping this very quiet.
*  But there was an interesting agreement at the classified level,
*  I believe, in the late 60s, where there was this relationship
*  with the United States.
*  We were putting up our northern tier radar system to detect
*  then Soviet Union ICBMs, and they were doing the same thing.
*  Because none of us really trusted each other.
*  But we trusted each other enough to say, look, before you hit that button,
*  if you see something coming over the horizon, before you hit that button
*  and launch, give us a call, because it might be a UFO. Right.
*  And we don't want to start World War Three because either side mistakes
*  the UFO for an ICBM. Right.
*  And that's how serious they took the topic.
*  I mean, that's real. That's a real memo that that that existed
*  between the United States and Russia.
*  So that's that is an indicator
*  how much both sides took this topic seriously. Mm hmm.
*  Jesus. And so when Philip Corso was dismissing
*  all these different things, did they have anything,
*  any film footage, any any stuff from that time, from Project Blue Book
*  that was like definitively not ours?
*  I'm not privy to what I'm aware of the fact that people say it does exist
*  and people have been briefed on it.
*  I wasn't privy to that.
*  I was, again, more focused on the here and now. Right.
*  I was aware of people who had attended certain meetings,
*  very senior level meetings where that was discussed,
*  where they saw certain footage.
*  But that's I'm hearing that secondhand.
*  I I did not see the old footage.
*  My my focus was more on the on the current what's going on now.
*  But back to your point, why was this effort to try to create
*  so much stigma and taboo?
*  I think it was because of that.
*  I think because you had Russia and US at this weird stalemate
*  where neither one wanted to tell the other side what we know
*  and what we didn't know about UAP.
*  And really, I think the focus from a national security perspective,
*  let's say you're a general and I'm a general.
*  Look, we've got a real Cold War going on here right now.
*  As long as these things aren't coming in and zapping my people,
*  that's going to be my focus right now.
*  That's that's a real potential threat that I have to deal with now.
*  I've got Russia pointing nukes at me and I'm pointing nukes at them.
*  At any time we could launch, let's focus on that.
*  Russia than the other stuff.
*  And that was that is that has been my observation on why
*  they didn't want to address the the the problem, the challenge
*  openly with the general public back.
*  And they also were worried there was there was several studies
*  that suggested that most people would be very uncomfortable with that idea,
*  that there's something else in the cosmos potentially or even right here on Earth.
*  And that it would create some sort of societal disruption.
*  Right. They didn't want to cause panic.
*  They were afraid that people would kind of like think of a run on Wall Street.
*  Right. When people get panic, they do kind of strange things sometimes.
*  And I think the government was very worried about that.
*  What's the most compelling modern thing that you've seen?
*  Oh, my God. I can't talk about it, unfortunately.
*  That's what that's this is my frustration, Joe, because I know what I've seen.
*  I know my colleagues are seeing right.
*  And to this day, there's there's video that's coming in on a regular
*  routine basis that is very, very compelling.
*  And if they had this stuff from the general public.
*  Well, we have classified systems behind a lot of it.
*  But how is it how is it getting filmed?
*  Is any of it getting filmed by the general public or is all this military stuff?
*  So let me backtrack a little bit.
*  This there is there there's a general public that is filming stuff.
*  But from a Department of Defense perspective, our focus now
*  arrows a different story.
*  But when I was in the government, we had to be very, very careful
*  of something we called intelligence oversight.
*  Back in the 60s and 70s, the U.S.
*  intelligence apparatus, particularly in the Department of Defense,
*  was kind of naughty.
*  They were doing things they shouldn't do.
*  They were spying on students and they were spying on American citizens.
*  You don't say crazy.
*  So it isn't so.
*  So Congress passed some laws and said, OK, you can no longer
*  do this kind of stuff on on on on American citizens.
*  Right. You can't conduct intelligence operations on American citizens.
*  You can't do it. It's illegal. Right.
*  So you have executive order, one, two, triple three and all these other rules
*  and laws and duty, 50 to 40.1 that all come out and say no mass.
*  So the Department of Defense is supposed to focus on military.
*  That's it. You don't you don't bring in U.S.
*  persons information and adjust them into a Department of Defense database,
*  especially a Department of Defense intelligence database.
*  That's a super no, no. That's called U.S.
*  persons information. And it's pretty much for Bowdoin.
*  So our focus was looking specifically at military sourced information.
*  I was not focusing at all on what the private citizens were seeing,
*  because at the end of the day, we couldn't use it.
*  You can't you can't do anything.
*  And it seems like you got plenty of compelling footage from the military.
*  Overwhelming, overwhelming.
*  It's there's absolutely no doubt that we didn't have to look at civilian data
*  because we had better collection sensor systems from the military
*  that was looking at stuff and giving us better insight.
*  If you can't tell us about can you give us some sort of an understanding
*  of like what you're talking about?
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Without being specific.
*  Yeah, let me see.
*  OK, yeah.
*  There is a video, high resolution video
*  of I can't say what platform was taken from.
*  I can't say where was taken from.
*  OK. But an object that, you know, do you know how large a an offshore
*  shore oil derrick is? They're huge.
*  Yeah, they're like almost like a small city, right?
*  They're like one city block.
*  They're huge. They're enormous things.
*  There is a video that shows one of the most important things
*  that shows one of these objects underwater
*  that goes by the speed was calculated between 450 and 550 knots underwater.
*  And it was bigger than the offshore derrick that it was passing,
*  because you could see in the video the offshore derrick
*  and you could see this thing zip right by it.
*  Jesus. Yeah.
*  So that's a lot of them, right?
*  A lot of them are reported as being transmedium.
*  Right. So exactly why?
*  Why do we use the term UAP? Right.
*  Now it's unidentified anomalous phenomenon because it's all domain.
*  Initially, was UFO unidentified flying object.
*  And for several reasons, they changed the name, one of them,
*  not just because of stigma, like people think,
*  but because the word flying object means flight.
*  And you have to have wings to fly. That's flight.
*  And these things don't have wings.
*  So that term, we're not even sure is even accurate anymore
*  because they're not necessarily flying.
*  We see them underwater.
*  We see them super high altitude.
*  So the term was changed to unidentified aerial phenomenon.
*  But again, that did not encompass all the observations we were seeing.
*  So now the term UAP, I think the latest
*  description of it is unidentified anomalous phenomenon
*  to help describe this multi-domain or transmedium characteristic
*  that we are beginning to see and record that these things can do.
*  And that is I'm going to, if I can digress for a second,
*  because that's super important, Joe.
*  We have transmedium vehicles, right?
*  We have things like seaplanes, and it's a plane and it can float on water.
*  But let's face it, a seaplane is neither a really good plane
*  or a really good boat because it's a compromise.
*  It's a design compromise between an object that you want to perform
*  in the air and in the sea.
*  And that's why it's neither really good at both.
*  Same thing with, for example, the space shuttle
*  goes out into space and it can glide down, but it's not a very good airplane.
*  Comes down like a brick, you know, right, because there's design
*  compromises and performance compromises.
*  But what we are seeing doesn't have any of that attributable compromise.
*  It's not these objects aren't slowing down.
*  They're not changing their their their performance capabilities.
*  They can do the same thing that we're seeing in the air
*  and possibly in space and even underwater.
*  So that is a that is a fundamentally different type of technology
*  than we are used to dealing with.
*  Is the assumption that they are doing something with space,
*  time and gravity around them?
*  Rather than using something like a jet propulsion engine
*  that blasts fire out the back and it makes it go fast forward, right?
*  They're doing something that alters the gravity around them.
*  Yeah. So that's why they can go through everything.
*  Yeah. So we had some of the best scientists on the team,
*  folks like Dr.
*  Hal Pudoff and some other folks that I'm not allowed to say their names,
*  Dr. Davis and some others that were doing the calculations,
*  mathematical calculations on how this is possible.
*  And the consensus was by by the scientists, not me,
*  because I'm not a physics expert and I'm not an astrophysicist.
*  They were saying that.
*  So let me back up here.
*  Initially, the government for years was trying to identify
*  the different exotic technologies that could explain
*  the different performance characteristics.
*  And it was during the eight years that the scientists had this consensus
*  that if you had one type of technology, if you could do one thing,
*  all these other observables now become possible.
*  Kind of think of like a unifying theory.
*  And so if you had the ability to to create this bubble
*  around you in a localized area
*  that insulated you from the effects of Earth's gravity.
*  Now, what is gravity?
*  People think that, you know, when I drop my glasses, that's gravity.
*  That's not gravity. That's an effect of gravity.
*  Gravity is the warping of space time.
*  And that's important because people don't they you hear the term
*  thrown around a lot, but they don't realize that space and time are actually connected.
*  They are they are they are one of the same.
*  They're opposite sides, if you will, of the same coin.
*  And so you can't have one without the other.
*  And so you have this ability to create a bubble around you
*  that insulates you from the warping of space time,
*  let's say in this case, Earth's gravity or something like that.
*  Then the way you experience time inside that bubble
*  is perhaps fundamentally different than the way you might experience
*  space time outside that bubble, because you're not you're not subject
*  to the effects of gravity, which would explain potentially,
*  why things don't need wings and why they don't need propulsion systems like that.
*  Right. So it's it's a completely different way of looking at
*  at how we understand physics and how we as humans
*  move about everything we do is fundamentally force equals mass times acceleration.
*  F equals MA, right? Mass times acceleration and your force.
*  This may be something a little bit different.
*  This is this is not using a set, again,
*  conventional thrust or if I put in a Newtonian, right, if I if I push this way,
*  I have an equal and opposite reaction that way. Right.
*  That's how there are any theories as to how it's accomplishing this.
*  There is actually Dr.
*  Hal Pudoff about three years ago gave a speech on this,
*  a very interesting talk lecture about this technology.
*  And if you ever have the chance, you really should have him on
*  because he's a he's a he's incredible human being.
*  He's also the one who helped start the government's remote viewing program
*  and a bunch of other stuff for the government.
*  He's been involved in a lot of our nation's probably most most classified efforts.
*  But he was working with us on ATP as one of our scientists.
*  And he gave a lecture about three years ago to some other scientists
*  about the specifics on how this is possible.
*  I am not a scientist.
*  I definitely not going to speak on behalf of how put off,
*  because I'm sure I will muck it up.
*  But I do recall a time when he came into our skiff
*  and gave us about a three hour lecture on this unifying theory.
*  And at that moment, it was very much for us, the epiphany
*  that a lot of us had been searching for.
*  He's like, look, at the end of the day, this is how it's possible.
*  And that was kind of this wow.
*  So it's really not.
*  Can you give us a moron's view of how it's possible?
*  Yeah. Explain to someone like me.
*  Yeah. Well, I'm in that category, Joe. So, you know,
*  speaking the same language. Yes, sir.
*  Yeah. Single syllable grunts, right?
*  Yeah. So you have you have an object like this cup.
*  On your table.
*  And you want it to be insulated from the effects of Earth's gravity.
*  So you you create this bubble artificially using a
*  certain energetic source at a certain frequency
*  and interacts with certain material, certain metamaterial.
*  And again, I got to be careful exactly what I say, but
*  certain skin of the craft, this aluminum, the cup here.
*  And all of a sudden, you have this bubble around you where
*  what you see on the outside is not necessarily what you see on the inside.
*  In fact, may do it. Sure.
*  More drawing. OK.
*  Forgive me. I'm not an artist.
*  So I'm going to do this upside down for you.
*  And then I'm going to kind of scoot this just a little here.
*  All right. Let's do this.
*  So. Unfortunately, I know your audience can't see this, but actually, it's OK.
*  Some people can. There's a video form of it.
*  Well, I'm sure this will get on a little bit on YouTube as well.
*  It's probably good that they don't, because I'm not an artist.
*  But let's say this is a two dimensional representation
*  of a three dimensional space. OK.
*  And in essence.
*  So what you've done is essentially you've created a three dimensional looking grid
*  stacked, looked like stack boxes on top of each other.
*  Yeah. Right. And so you have this.
*  You have location A and location B.
*  And let's say go from Los Angeles to Baltimore. OK.
*  And it takes me five hours to fly at 500 miles an hour.
*  That's a function of distance over time.
*  And in essence, you can mark that linearly like this.
*  So I fly. Takes me five hours.
*  There I am. OK. If you had the ability to compress
*  space time and not a lot, just a little bit, and you were able to
*  allow these points to be a little closer together.
*  Now, in essence, what took you, let's say, five hours
*  and 500 miles an hour to do it.
*  You can do it in one hour and you can do it in much less time.
*  But to the observer outside, we're still in the same universe.
*  We would see something like that.
*  We would see this incredible hopscotching ability to to, if you will,
*  take a shortcut through space time.
*  And so what would appear to be instantaneous acceleration,
*  hypersonic velocity and other things
*  now becomes a reality.
*  And so that is that is fundamentally
*  what what the scientists had discovered.
*  And so it seems like science fiction.
*  But when you understand the mathematics and some of the theorem
*  that they propose, a lot of these other observables become possible.
*  So these are essentially just theoretical explanations
*  of how these things are moving.
*  Yeah. And again, I'm not I'm not a scientist.
*  I want to be very careful.
*  You know, I don't want to misrepresent anything.
*  There's a whole lot of other stuff that if you can do that,
*  all of a sudden now makes sense and may describe the observations
*  that people are are are seeing and why they're kind of hard to see.
*  And they seem obscure. Right.
*  And so I think from from a from a governmental perspective,
*  that it was kind of a revelatory moment for for for the folks in our in our program.
*  So they realized one of the reasons why these things are weird looking
*  is because they're literally creating one light.
*  Do you mind? I'm sorry.
*  Thank you.
*  So. The back thing, the other side, push that down.
*  There you go.
*  Thank you very much. No problem.
*  So how how much of this is theoretical
*  and how much of this is observed from recovered vehicles?
*  I am not allowed to talk about what the government may or may not have in its
*  possession, other than that I have.
*  So I went through a very lengthy Pentagon review process recently.
*  I wrote I won't talk about it here, but I wrote something
*  and I had to go through Pentagon to have a review process.
*  And it took almost a year
*  in this this thing I wrote.
*  I I talk about up to the led up to the part I can talk about.
*  And they approved for me to talk about up to that point.
*  When it comes to what the government may or may not have in its possession,
*  all I can simply say is that there is very compelling evidence
*  to suggest that the U.S. government is in absolute possession of exotic material
*  that is not made by humans.
*  Now, beyond that, I can't really expound upon.
*  I haven't been given permission to talk about it.
*  But what I can say is what I've already said for the record,
*  which has been approved by the Pentagon.
*  Won't get in trouble by saying it.
*  Is that that that we are there's very compelling
*  data to suggest that we are in possession.
*  Why is the Pentagon teasing us?
*  Why do they tell you why are they allowing you to say
*  we are in possession of something that was not made by human beings,
*  but not allowed to elaborate, not allowed to show these very compelling
*  videos that you're talking about that you've seen?
*  I don't think well, two reasons.
*  I don't think they have a choice.
*  I think with now the introduction of cell phones and ring cameras,
*  the cat's out of the bag.
*  It's the worst kept secret at this point.
*  Two, there is a faction, unlike before in the Cold War.
*  I believe there is a faction of people inside the government
*  that do want this conversation to occur.
*  But equally, there's still a faction of people that are very mad with me.
*  They do not want me having this conversation and mark my words
*  just by me being on your show.
*  It is going to cause an absolute storm
*  inside the Pentagon.
*  And I am sure the other shoe is going to drop.
*  I promise you, it's going to be you're going to hear all sorts of stuff.
*  People make stuff up about me trying to discredit this topic,
*  because as many people are in the government that want this topic
*  to be discussed now, there's still some people that do not want this.
*  Could you steel man their position?
*  Say again, steel man their position, meaning could you argue it
*  from their perspective? Absolutely.
*  Like why would be a good reason to keep this stuff quiet? Sure.
*  And I want to preface here, I'm not I'm not fear mongering.
*  No, no, but look, if I was if I was a military person, right,
*  I would look at this from the perspective of there's three options.
*  They're good. They're neutral or they're bad.
*  So let's go down this road for a second.
*  Let's say they're good. Right.
*  Well, we've got nothing to worry about.
*  The problem is there's nothing to suggest that they truly are benevolent.
*  People say, well, you know, they're like they don't want us to nuke ourselves.
*  Well, you know, I discuss it in what I wrote that there's no there's no
*  there's no data to suggest that they didn't stop us from dropping
*  atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and vaporizing 500000 living souls.
*  They didn't stop us when we started developing nuclear weapons
*  from the atomic age.
*  They didn't stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
*  They didn't stop the testing in the Nevada range of atomic and nuclear weapons.
*  And now how many countries have atomic weapons and nuclear weapons?
*  A lot. Right.
*  They didn't stop Chernobyl.
*  They didn't stop Fukushima.
*  They didn't stop Three Mile Island.
*  So to say that they're here to help us, I'm not sure there's there's data.
*  People say, well, you know, in in in Minot and in North Dakota and Montana,
*  they the UFOs came in and they stopped.
*  They interfered with our nuclear weapons and they brought the entire
*  echo flight offline, which, by the way, I have the government report on that,
*  if you want it.
*  But in Russia, a lot of people don't know they turned them on. Right.
*  So that's equally scary.
*  They're interfering with our nuclear capability, whether to attack or to defend ourselves.
*  So when you say they turned them on in Russia, this is a Russian report.
*  Yeah. So this is a I don't know if you remember the
*  hearing congressional hearing that occurred last year where the
*  no, the other one with Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence,
*  Ronald Moultrie and some people from the Navy.
*  And I think it was Congressman Gallagher that asked the very specific question.
*  And he said, Are you aware of
*  UFOs interfering with our nuclear capabilities?
*  And the response was something like, no, not really familiar with it.
*  Never heard of it.
*  And then the question was, I think we asked specifically at these locations.
*  And the government's response was, no, not familiar with it. Well,
*  here's the actual report from the Department of Defense.
*  This is the actual intelligence report that was released through FOIA.
*  There's a there's a gentleman out there who runs a site called the Black Vault.
*  His name is John Greenwald.
*  He's probably the world authority on Freedom of Information Act.
*  And he has a wealth of data that is out available to the public
*  that he has received from the government. This is one of those documents.
*  This is the document that our own government has no idea apparently exists.
*  I like how they write it in all caps. Yeah. Yeah. That's the old reporting.
*  So obviously there's some people that don't want this to be released.
*  And obviously there's some people that think that the general public has a right to know.
*  I believe so. That's that's my that's been my observations in my experience.
*  Well, that makes sense. You know, I mean, like when everybody says the CIA does this,
*  like, OK, who will win the CIA? I didn't finish though the other parts. Right.
*  So if they're not here for friend, if they're not, it's not friendly. Right.
*  That leaves them neutral like us. Right. Or benevolent. Benevolent.
*  Now, from a military perspective, and I just want to caveat, I don't agree with this,
*  but I can respect the understanding you, sir, are a general.
*  And I say to you and I say,
*  we cannot prove that they're not here to do something bad.
*  But what we do know is that they can interfere.
*  They're very interested in our military capabilities.
*  And they have interfered with our nuclear capabilities. Right.
*  From a military perspective, that looks an awful lot like something we call IPB,
*  initial preparations of the battle space, or perhaps even ISR,
*  intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance.
*  Whenever we're going to go into a foreign country and invade,
*  we do long range surveillance.
*  We want to know how the enemy operates, how they react.
*  So even if there's a 2% chance, 5% chance that these things are
*  are here to do something malevolent. Right.
*  Then we probably should not tip our hands to the fact that we are aware of it
*  publicly, because what happens the moment that the bad guys in a foreign country
*  find our surveillance team over the border? We've got 12 hours.
*  We got to invade because the element of surprise is now over.
*  So some may feel under government, the mere fact of acknowledging this,
*  if there is some sort of malintent may push up artificially a clock
*  that exists somewhere for these things to say, Oh, okay. The,
*  the foolish humans are now the cat's out of the bag. They know where, where,
*  we're here. We need to go in now for whatever reason they may have.
*  So that is the military mindset potentially of some of these individuals who want
*  to keep this secret.
*  Cause so they're worried about an actual invasion. Well, but, but they have to be,
*  that is, that is the role of our national security apparatus, right?
*  Even if there's a 1% chance, right,
*  they have to consider that in their planning and in the decision making matrix.
*  So again, going back to what I said, I respect that. I don't agree with it,
*  but I can respect that. If that is the reason why, then I would say, okay,
*  look in your heart, you really do have the best interests of the American people.
*  You are a patriot. I can accept that. Again,
*  I don't think it's your decision to make. I think needs to go to Congress.
*  I think initiative to the president, let the American people decide. I think,
*  I think America can handle the truth.
*  I think America deserves the truth and let the American people decide if,
*  if it's in their best interest.
*  But I also could see it from their perspective,
*  like they're probably insanely busy already.
*  And the last thing they want to do is get involved in this thing where now they
*  have a PR campaign when they're trying to let people know about this thing and
*  not cause mass panic.
*  That's right. That's right. But you know what though,
*  I'm also very optimistic Joe,
*  cause you and I are having this conversation and people aren't making a run on
*  wall street. People are still paying their mortgages,
*  going to PTA meetings.
*  And after the 2017 New York times report,
*  which was probably one of the biggest moments in UFO disclosure,
*  because it was in the New York times. And then you see something like that in the
*  New York, especially in New York times in 2017, people really respected it.
*  It's like, this is, this is a real story.
*  Well, and this is, this is apolitical. I mean,
*  how many topics can you go to Congress and have that's not polarized? Right.
*  Right. Right.
*  This is one of the only ones where you can have literally have Congressman
*  Bershett and, and, and Congresswoman AOC side by side,
*  agreeing that this, this is important. Right. This is, this is,
*  it's a very rare opportunity. And so, you know, my concern,
*  I'm doing this because I believe it's the right thing to do.
*  And my concern is that we're at a point now where I've said before, you know,
*  secrets aren't like a fine wine where the longer you keep a cork on it,
*  the better it gets. I think secrets are perishable.
*  I think they have a shelf life.
*  I think they're like vegetables in your refrigerator.
*  And there comes a point where if you leave them there too long,
*  they start to rot and they start to stink and it becomes a big mess to clean
*  up. Right. And so that's my perspective.
*  And what I'm trying to do is give the government an ability to work its way
*  out of a corner that it's put itself into for the last several decades and with
*  no seeming way out. Right. Right. You look around like, well,
*  how do we get ourselves out of this trip?
*  Is there an issue of legality, like of, of spending and like,
*  a hundred percent, a hundred percent.
*  There's people that would be liable for not being straightforward with
*  Congress. And I know people want their pound of flesh.
*  I know there's people out there you, we've been lied to for decades.
*  And I want, and then they make it a political issue. Right.
*  You go after someone for, yeah.
*  And I think that's the wrong approach. I think, you know,
*  there was a time where we needed to keep this secret.
*  And I think what you do is you, you, you give those guys awards,
*  give those guys and gals awards who did it. Don't, don't make them enemies,
*  make them friends and say, okay, look, but those were different times.
*  Now is the time to, to, to come clean, talk to the members of Congress,
*  forgive all the past sins. Yeah.
*  A hundred percent.
*  And let's just get clear with all this and understand that it was all in good
*  faith that you did it in the first place. One hundred percent. Now,
*  all in the interest of the United States security,
*  you talk about legal issues.
*  The problem is there are the real legal issues. So let's say you have, again,
*  these cups forgive my analogies. You have two aerospace companies,
*  company a company B and let's say I am in the department of defense back in the
*  50s, sixties. And I come across this interesting technology.
*  I have no idea what the hell it is. It just came out of the sky.
*  And I go to company a and I said,
*  tell me what you can figure out about that. Right. Ten years later,
*  company a becomes a multi-billion dollar aerospace company.
*  Company B goes bankrupt, 200 people lose their jobs.
*  And now people who have stock investors in that company lose their money.
*  Right. Unfair advantage. Keep in mind,
*  you're supposed to have fair competition in the U S government.
*  So if you give an unfair advantage to company a to B,
*  you're talking a serious liability. There's SEC violations there.
*  There's all sorts of concerns one has to pay attention to because someone
*  somewhere gave an unfair advantage to one company over another. So there,
*  there are legal liabilities that we have to, we have to recognize.
*  It's not just clear cut. Okay. Forgive and forget. You know,
*  there's going to have to be some,
*  some additional protection and understanding for if,
*  if that occurred, we need to figure out how we deal with that as well.
*  So that would be an impediment to release. That makes a lot of sense.
*  Yeah. These are big companies, right? With deep pockets and a lot of lawyers.
*  Well, I mean, also this is a discussion that we've had on here before.
*  If you did find something, who would you bring it to?
*  You bring it to the people that build your fucking jets. Like, Hey guys,
*  what the hell is this? Like, you know,
*  you make some sort of a top secret agreement.
*  You bring it to them in some sort of a undisclosed facility.
*  That's the brightest.
*  You're best in bringing the guys in and go, what the fuck is this thing? Yeah.
*  You kind of have to otherwise like how, what else would you do? You know,
*  I mean, how else do you find out how these things work?
*  And if you were going to do it in a secretive manner,
*  you would have to bring it to defense contractors because those are the only
*  people that are capable of making things. They make your jets. They make,
*  they make the, you know, every stealth bomber, every,
*  well whatever the fuck it is, they make all that shit.
*  Going back to, you know, a colleague of mine made the comparison. He said, look,
*  Lou, imagine being during the days of DaVinci and all of a sudden bringing
*  DaVinci a garage door opener. You have no idea what it's used for.
*  I've never seen plastic before and you don't even understand electromagnetic
*  radiation, right? And, and, and infrared, you know,
*  where do you start on the analysis and exploitation of a technology that the
*  physics hasn't even been discovered yet? Right.
*  I mean garage door openers seem like magic. It really does. You know,
*  I press a button and a door opens like magic. Wait, where's the horse?
*  Where's the strings? What's that? Right. Yeah. So it's kind of bananas.
*  You press a button on your car and all of a sudden your door opens, right?
*  And you drive in and you press another button and it closes.
*  And it's all done through the air, right? Which is bananas magic,
*  but we're just accustomed to it. That's right. Yeah.
*  So this kind of technology I'm sure you're aware of the Bob Lazar story.
*  I'm aware. I don't know Bob. I've never met him. You never got into that.
*  I've, I did not. How could you not with your line of work?
*  Because, you know, I always wanted to be insulated from prejudicing the jury.
*  And I know it sounds kind of strange, but I didn't ever make sense. You know,
*  it's, it's, it's, it's kind of something I impose on myself because I didn't want
*  to have any preconceived notions of going in. Most people kind of,
*  I suspect would be tempted to say, well, I'm gonna learn everything I can about,
*  you know, UFO lore. I wanted the opposite.
*  You're a better man than me.
*  I know. Well, I love them very, you know, I think, um, I just,
*  I just wanted to be very,
*  very careful to preserve the investigative integrity,
*  right? And we're, look, we're all humans. We're all biased.
*  There's no way around it. We all have some degree of bias.
*  Let's, let's be honest and truthful here. It doesn't matter what type of bias it is.
*  We all have some sort of bias somewhere,
*  whether it's food or the people you like to date or whatever. Um,
*  I wanted to avoid that as much as possible. And so I,
*  I always kept it very, very focused on the here and now. And you know, what,
*  what can we see today?
*  Right. You're aware of the story though, right? The basic,
*  tangentially that he worked at a particular facility and at that facility,
*  he was exposed to some sort of, uh, UAP technology.
*  Right. That thing, that thing right there, the sport model,
*  and that he was brought in, um,
*  as a propulsions expert and to try to,
*  they didn't know how it exactly worked, but they,
*  they sort of just said, tell me what this is. Roger.
*  And then along the way he realized, Oh, this isn't even ours. Yeah. I'm,
*  I'm aware of, again, the overarching story.
*  I don't know any of the details and I've, I've never met him personally. So,
*  I'm a very, very interesting guy.
*  I had dinner with them with my friend Andrew Schultz and Jeremy Corbell. We,
*  we went to dinner and you know,
*  informally talked and had a fascinating conversation.
*  Jeremy is a great guy. He's a great guy. He's really, you know,
*  he's done a lot. He said to say hi.
*  He's pumped that we're talking. Yeah. He's done a lot. He's a UFO nut.
*  And he got me really way back in with his documentary, um,
*  of Bob Lazar flying saucers, whatever, wherever the actual title of it is.
*  But that, that documentary is fantastic.
*  And it's essentially going over Bob Lazar story from the 1980s to today,
*  which he's told the exact same story,
*  which is nuts that you have one giant lie your whole life. Like, come on.
*  There's a lot of weirdness to the story, obviously. Um,
*  like there is with everything.
*  There's a lot of people that want to discredit his, um,
*  his background and all sorts of other things.
*  But the reality of what he's saying is essentially what we're seeing in these
*  crafts, which is very strange.
*  So he described how these things worked and how they moved and how they would
*  turn sideways and sort of like project this,
*  whatever this reactor that they have inside of them.
*  And he talked about this element, element one 15,
*  they have a stable version of it that was essentially theoretical at the time in
*  1980. No,
*  no one really knew whether or not that thing actually even exists 89 or whatever
*  it was. And that they would douse this thing,
*  project radiation upon it. And it would create this warp, this gravity warp,
*  this, this thing that allowed this,
*  this craft to move in ways that defied our understanding.
*  It's a hell of a lucky guess.
*  It's hell of a lucky guess in 1989.
*  Wow.
*  And he drew it,
*  he has diagrams of what this thing looked like and you know how it worked.
*  And it essentially looked exactly like that little model that's on the desk
*  there. And that he felt like the whole, it didn't make any sense.
*  He said the whole thing, it didn't have any seams,
*  which now we understand 3d printing, right?
*  So now we know that we can actually,
*  but only now, not back then, right? Everything had rivets.
*  The skin of a craft was the skin of an aircraft, rivets and had nuts and bolts.
*  Exactly. You know, but now, you know,
*  obviously now we have carbon fiber,
*  we have a bunch of different ways of constructing things. But back then,
*  he didn't know what the fuck that thing was.
*  He said it looked like it had all been melted, like into place,
*  like that it had been like almost like smooth, like wax, like melted wax.
*  And that it had no instrumentation inside of it.
*  And it was designed for very small things,
*  like something that was like three feet tall.
*  And that all these things seem to operate through the,
*  the being itself had some sort of connection to the craft,
*  some sort of strange way of interfacing with the craft that didn't have anything
*  to do with pulling levers and moving things.
*  But Joe, is that really that much of a stretch? Let's, let's look at this.
*  You know, we have,
*  we've done experiments where we've had pilots be able to control aircraft
*  thousands of miles away with a helmet that interprets thought, right?
*  So it's, you know, again,
*  How does the helmet enter? Is it similar to like a Neuralink setup?
*  Have you seen the new video of the second Neuralink patient?
*  I have not.
*  Is this video of him playing Counter-Strike? Is it Counter-Strike or is it a,
*  is that it? So Counter-Strike, which is a very popular online,
*  a 3D game.
*  And this guy who does not have use of his body has this Neuralink implant.
*  He's the second Neuralink patient. And apparently with each iteration,
*  it gets more and more sophisticated and better. So this is a,
*  from this person's point of view,
*  he's playing this video game entirely with his mind.
*  So he's better than I can with my hands.
*  Anybody can can be, because the first guy who,
*  the first Neuralink patient we had him on and he said essentially it's like
*  having an aim bot because you don't miss.
*  You look at the thing you're trying to shoot at and instantaneously your cross
*  hairs go there. Yeah. So he's, all this stuff is taking place entirely.
*  This is all him doing this entirely with his mind.
*  But is that right? So if we can do that now, right? Right.
*  Is it really that far of a stretch to think that, you know,
*  someone who's a little more advanced than us, right?
*  Our friends from out of town realize that's the way to do it.
*  That's more efficient, right? The speed of the processing of the brain,
*  the processes of the brain is much faster.
*  It takes us longer to then have to mechanically use our hands and manipulate and
*  do things. This is almost not quite, but almost instantaneous.
*  You don't have that lag, right? Of course. So that would certainly make sense.
*  You know, modern warfare, not the game,
*  but actual modern warfare is beginning to turn to that.
*  And we're using AI and all these other augmentation to enhance performance.
*  And so I, I don't think that's out of the realm of, of possibility.
*  No, certainly not. I mean, just go from garage door openers to, you know,
*  500, 600 years ago to today. And then cell phones,
*  the ability to send video across the world instantaneously,
*  all the sophisticated stuff that we've just completely take for granted because
*  it's become a normal part of our everyday life.
*  That's, you know, I used to, I used to give a briefing to some folks.
*  I'm so glad you mentioned this because it's,
*  this goes back to the whole stigma and taboo issue.
*  I used to have a slideshow and I still have it somewhere. And I would,
*  I would discuss the word, the Latin word prefix of para,
*  P A R A and it means above or beside. And so what I would do is show up,
*  I would say the word parachute and I'd ask people,
*  what do you think of when you hear the word parachute?
*  And people would describe obviously something that deploys over your head and
*  hopefully you hit the ground with a, with a thump and not a thud, right?
*  But something that's normal we use every day. And then I say,
*  what about the word paramedic? And then people would look at it and say, well,
*  I think of a first responder, someone goes some, you know,
*  some sort of medical lifesaver that's going to,
*  going to be there for your benefit. And then I say the word,
*  when I say the word paranormal, what do you think?
*  And people will stop for a second.
*  Maybe they kind of give you a little sly smile and say, what do you mean?
*  So what do you mean? I mean that paranormal.
*  The only reason why you're reacting the way you are,
*  because you've been conditioned that the word paranormal is, is cookie stuff.
*  When in reality in science, by definition,
*  everything is paranormal until it becomes normal.
*  The cell phone that I use every day, 50 years ago, absolutely paranormal.
*  And so I would go through this exercise of things that were once considered
*  paranormal. For example, when the Inca first saw the Spaniards,
*  the conquistadores coming from the reconquering,
*  they saw them on the shores of the beach and they saw these,
*  these humans in armor riding on a horse and they assumed,
*  cause they'd never seen a horse before. They assumed it was a single entity.
*  It was a single monster. And that for them was paranormal.
*  They didn't understand it was actually a human riding on a horse with metal
*  skin. Same thing with acupuncture.
*  I remember a time when I was growing up as a kid,
*  people thought Eastern medicine acupuncture was nonsense.
*  Well now at the veterans administration, the VA, for some of my guys in combat,
*  they actually prescribe acupuncture as therapy. It's not paranormal, right?
*  And so there's all these examples in history where we think something is kooky
*  and weird when in reality it's not, it's just, we don't understand it yet.
*  And we have done such a good job of stigmatizing this conversation
*  that the moment you even say the word paranormal or you say the word UFO,
*  anything like that, people are conditioned without even thinking about it.
*  It's reflexive to react a certain way.
*  And we have to first deprogram ourselves first a little bit before we can start
*  moving forward. Okay. Let's how do we just de-stigmatize this conversation?
*  Well, first of all, what's kooky, you know,
*  what do you think is kooky about something that's in our airspace that's
*  performing in ways that we can't replicate, you know, that people say, well,
*  you know, we, wait a minute,
*  we spend millions if not billions of dollars putting a probe on Mars to try to
*  find microbial life. And by the way, it looks like that may happen.
*  It looks like there actually may be some evidence to suggest that we spend lots
*  of money trying to find techno signatures of intelligent life,
*  radio signatures in our own Milky way, right? Well,
*  is it possible within the four and a half billion years our planet's been here,
*  that maybe intelligent life maybe found us first? Is it possible?
*  Could be, you know, we, we, we have to stop putting these, these limitations.
*  Joe, when I was, when I was in the medical program,
*  when I was learning to be microbiology and immunology in college,
*  we learned from our professor that homo sapiens sapien as a modern species has
*  been around roughly between 100,000 to 200,000 years. Now, I'm not an expert,
*  but that's, that's what they say.
*  It was only the Greeks 2000 years ago that introduced the idea that there's only
*  two types of life forms on this planet. And either you are either a,
*  a plant or B you're an animal. And it wasn't the last 300 years.
*  So if you look at a 24 hour clock,
*  roughly the last five minutes in the 24 hours towards midnight,
*  we discovered another form of life that is neither plant nor animal that's been
*  here with us on this planet. And that is the world of fungus.
*  During the Renaissance and the days of Newton,
*  we discovered that there was this other life form we've been sharing all along.
*  And we, so we pat ourselves on the shoulder and it wasn't the last 120 years.
*  Think about it. The last 10 seconds of our existence on this planet,
*  so to speak in a 24 hour clock as a modern species,
*  we actually discovered the true dominant life form on this planet.
*  And in fact,
*  if you take all the biomass of every plant and the biomass of every animal and
*  the biomass of every fungus and add it all up together,
*  it still will not equal the biomass of this hidden kingdom of
*  life. That's actually the dominant life form on this planet.
*  And that wasn't until we were able to curve glass and look through a little
*  steel tube and famously shout little beasties, little beasties,
*  did we discover the world of microorganisms that yes, live inside of you. And yes,
*  live on the skin of the ISS space station. Yes.
*  Live miles underneath the Arctic ice, right?
*  That is the true dominant life form on this planet. And it always has been.
*  And it wasn't in the last until the last 120 years, we discovered that.
*  So is it possible that there's something else that is just as normal to this
*  world? Is it possible? Well, the answer is a resounding yes, of course,
*  it's possible because we're always discovering new, new, new,
*  new ways life can exist. When I was growing up as a kid,
*  I was told absolutely as a matter of fact,
*  all life form is derived from photosynthesis.
*  Ultimately when you go all the way down, it turns out that's not true.
*  It wasn't until we discovered the, in the deepest,
*  deepest depths of our oceans where these things called black smokers,
*  we discovered there are creatures that thrive with no light and they thrive off
*  of something called chemo synthesis,
*  a completely different way to metabolize energy to sustain life. Right?
*  So every time we put mother nature in a little box,
*  she always finds a way to wiggle her way out.
*  And I think that's important when having this conversation,
*  because if there's one thing we know as human beings,
*  we're usually wrong at first.
*  Well, we exist and we do send things to other planets.
*  So we do send things into space.
*  It only makes sense that something far more intelligent than us that would be
*  doing that. And if they did, they'd probably watch an emerging civilization,
*  which is essentially what we are. Right. And like you said,
*  200,000 years, which is nothing, the existence of homo sapiens,
*  they've gone from things that use stones and Flint map to things that can fly
*  things through the air. I mean, if you look at Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright,
*  when they flew the first airplane, you go from that to the Apollo 11 launch.
*  That's only like what? 50 years. That's right. Something crazy like that.
*  That's right. That's nuts. Right.
*  And you just take that and everything moves exponentially.
*  You take that and you would imagine a civilization that's been around 10,000
*  years longer than us, 100,000 years long, a million years longer than us.
*  Something that doesn't exist. How about a hundred years?
*  We have evolved more in the last 150 years than we have in the last 150,000
*  years. Sure. Yeah. So, you know, and then you have the other, other,
*  for me, I find when people say, well, the space is so huge and, and you know,
*  is it possible that things are coming from outer space?
*  My response has always been the same. Look, I, I don't know where they're from.
*  I just know that they're here and, and could they be from outer space? Sure.
*  They can be from inner space or even the space in between.
*  And, and I say that because the universe is far more complex than,
*  than we give it credit for. Every time there was a time we had Newtonian
*  physics, we thought that was a solution. Then all of a sudden Einstein comes
*  along and we realize that wait, space and time are actually connected and then
*  everything's relative. And all of a sudden now you have quantum mechanics,
*  which is, you know, this spooky action at a distance, right?
*  Where the whole universe is behaving in a way that it shouldn't.
*  And yet that looks like the real way the universe works.
*  I often tell people we are as humans, we,
*  we have five only five fundamental senses that we can base our reality upon.
*  And if you can't touch it, taste it here, it's smell it, et cetera.
*  We can't interact with it. And so where I live in Wyoming,
*  we have these beautiful night skies kind of kind of like you have here in your,
*  in your studio here, 300 days of unaccluded night skies.
*  And as beautiful as those night skies are,
*  if you were to look at that same portion of the night sky through a radio
*  telescope, you would see a whole different reality around you.
*  You'd see nebula and you'd see things in different spectra that we can't pick up.
*  You pick an ultraviolet and infrared. So you would see a whole different reality,
*  just like our cell phones, right?
*  If you could see in cell phone vision and see in wifi and 5g and GPS,
*  you would interact with your environment completely different because you would
*  see reality.
*  So we can only interact with a very small sliver of the
*  reality that we can perceive because we're humans.
*  But most of reality is actually beyond that. And then of course,
*  you have scalability issues.
*  The universe is immensely huge and what scientists are now saying,
*  if you look in any direction, you can see roughly within the visible,
*  let me emphasize visible horizon of our universe is about 13.9
*  billion light years plus or minus.
*  So that means in any direction I can see 13.9 billion light years with the right
*  equipment. What's a light year? Well, it's as fast as light can travel in a year.
*  Well, light travels pretty fast. In fact,
*  it travels at 186,000 miles per second.
*  So seven and a half times around our planet in one second.
*  So imagine how far you can go in a year.
*  Now multiply that by 13.9 billion and that by scientists
*  estimation. So if the universe end to end of our visible,
*  we're stuck in the middle is roughly 27 billion light years.
*  Scientists are now saying that's only possibly only 10% of the known universe
*  because the universe is so big and so vast and so far light will never have time
*  to reach earth. So that's, that's a hunt at a minimum of 100 billion light years.
*  Right. And so we are this little speck in the middle.
*  And as, as, as crazy as that is to even try to conceive,
*  if you compare one atom inside the, you know, one hydrogen atom,
*  Avogadro's number, right? One times 10 to the negative umpteen all the way down.
*  Uh, it is roughly the same level of scale
*  as we are to the universe,
*  meaning that Adam is the size of a human as we are the size of the universe,
*  as we are a human to the size of the universe. So there is this,
*  and we as humans can only interact plus or minus with one order of magnitude up
*  or down. Otherwise the universe is simply too big or too small,
*  meaning most of the universe and reality lies in those scales.
*  We live in this little tiny, tiny sliver.
*  And so you hurt my head.
*  We live in a tiny sliver and the idea that we're alone,
*  I think is preposterous. I really do.
*  And I know people they constantly chime in with this.
*  So where's the evidence of, you know,
*  Elon's famously said if the aliens are real, they're very subtle.
*  I don't know why he says that though. I think,
*  I think he probably says that cause he doesn't want to sound like a kook while
*  he's working with NASA and SpaceX, you know,
*  I'd probably say some stuff like that too.
*  Well, let me ask you this as human beings, right?
*  How many times do we fly over the Serengeti in a helicopter, right?
*  And let's say you want to monitor the health of a particular, you know,
*  a herd of elephants, right? And so what happens are wildebeest, we fly over,
*  we pick one, we, we shoot it with a tranquilizer, it falls asleep, we go down,
*  we do some tests, pull its blood.
*  Now think about it from the perspective of the wildebeest, right?
*  It wakes up kind of meanders over to the watering hole and says, Bill,
*  you're not going to believe this man,
*  but something out of the sky came down and all of a sudden they were touching me
*  and you know, I woke up in my butt hurt, right? What the hell was that?
*  To this day, even in China, when we were into a zoo, right?
*  And we have the panda bear exhibits. What do we do? We put,
*  so we don't disrupt the pandas. We wear panda suits. Now it sounds silly,
*  but you can actually get online and see zookeepers wearing panda suits because
*  they don't want to scare.
*  They want to interfere as least as possible with a natural flora and fauna
*  there inside the exhibit. Right.
*  Do you think then could you, was it reasonable to theorize that there's
*  aliens amongst us?
*  When you say, well, two things. So I don't want to be evasive. Let me,
*  but I also want to be very specific when we say aliens and then we also, are we,
*  are we saying something from another plane or are we saying non-human
*  intelligence that looks like us moves around with us?
*  So is it possible? Well, we're doing it already with the panda bear. So, you know,
*  it's not that we do it all the time.
*  It seems like a strategy that'd be very simple.
*  Sure. And especially if you have the technology now as far as,
*  the panda bear. Carrying little baby pandas.
*  Boy, those are shitty panda bear outfits too.
*  They're fucking terrible looking.
*  They're pretty terrifying aren't they actually?
*  Put that in front of my dog. He's going to bark. If like a dude,
*  your dog costume, he'd be like, Oh, that ain't a fucking dog.
*  Yeah. Well that's a wild panda bear. Not, no, that dude's not a panda bear.
*  That's crazy. See that. Panda terrorists. That looks like a fucking alien.
*  Like it was really dark out and that guy grabbed you and zapped you with a
*  tranquilizer. You'd have an alien story.
*  But yeah, my point is that we, we always, you know, use camouflage. Right.
*  For obvious reason. We do it in military, right? We camouflage,
*  I would camouflage uniform, I stealth aircraft, you know, for camouflage.
*  Sure. You do it when you go hunting. Absolutely. I do. Absolutely. So,
*  so it's not,
*  it's not a stretch of the imagination to suggest anything coming here that
*  doesn't want to provoke us. Probably wants to blend in. Now, of course,
*  do I have any type of empirical evidence to suggest that they are living among
*  us? I don't want, I can say definitively that whatever it is, it's here.
*  And by the way,
*  you already have very senior people in our government that have said it's here,
*  whatever it is. But these things could also be from under the water.
*  These things could be something that is as natural to earth as the little
*  beasties were, right? When we first discovered them, maybe,
*  maybe they've been here all along. Right. So the,
*  the ocean is largely undiscovered.
*  One of the things that people need to understand is that most of the
*  exploration of the ocean is really essentially around the outside edges.
*  It's around the shores. Less than 10%. So which is nuts. A buddy of mine,
*  90% of the ocean. That's right. Like what?
*  We know more about the moon than the bottom of our own ocean. And so,
*  so crazy. Yeah. That's fact.
*  And these underwater crafts like this enormous one that apparently was
*  near this oil rig. How many of them have been,
*  has there been more than one of those videos?
*  So let me tell you what I can say from open source. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um,
*  and then I'll tell you about a conversation I had without attribution cause I
*  don't want to get in trouble. Um,
*  everybody's when I say everybody,
*  a lot of people are familiar with the air force's program called the fast walker
*  program, which is a program that was, uh,
*  started by the air force among other things was to detect UFOs. That's a fact.
*  It's actually, that's part of their mission to detect a lot of things,
*  adversarial technology. But UFOs was one of them.
*  It was called the fast walker program. There was, uh,
*  some information that was released publicly, uh,
*  about a similar program. The Navy has, I can't talk about it cause I,
*  I don't have approval to talk about it. Uh,
*  but obviously they're interested because they have equities underwater.
*  They're interested in if there's anything underwater that can perform beyond
*  anything we have. And I remember speaking to one individual, uh,
*  who pulled me aside very privately and he said, Lou, uh,
*  we were tracking this thing doing,
*  and I won't say the exact speed, but hundreds and hundreds of knots underwater.
*  And it was bigger than our own submarine. Right?
*  And you know how big our submarines are, right? They're huge. I have some,
*  naively, I just kind of came out, what do you do when you encounter that?
*  And he just said very honestly, he said, we go around just like that.
*  We go around.
*  Have there been interactions with these things?
*  I, I, I would not have lived to discuss any details about that.
*  That's not for me to discuss. Um, you know, I, uh,
*  I'm a lightweight, you know,
*  let's go have some whiskey, find out what the fuck is up.
*  So this thing is bigger than the sub and they,
*  they followed it for hundreds of miles.
*  Let me give you another, a great, great, um, event that occurred.
*  And I'll talk about this because it's not classified. Um,
*  the portions that might be, I don't know about, so I should be fine. Um,
*  there's an individual who I'm aware of who was a helipilot, a helicopter pilot,
*  back in the late nineties, uh, in the Caribbean,
*  and they were doing missile recovery.
*  So what happened is that the Navy would test fire missiles and then they kind of
*  run out of fuel. They hit the water and they sink that a predetermined time.
*  They, they popped to the surface. We grab it with a helicopter,
*  bring it back to shore and we,
*  we test it for telemetry and make sure that the, you know,
*  this cruise missile was doing what it was supposed to do.
*  So they're out there in the helicopter, um, frogmen hanging down the line. Uh,
*  you got the helo pilot,
*  you got the crew chief and a other co-pilot looking all down at the bubble.
*  And as they're about to grab this, this cruise missile out of the ocean,
*  something huge and round.
*  And what was described to me as black as a devil starts to rise to the surface.
*  The water begins to churn very much like David Fravor's description of the
*  Tic Tac incident and the roiling water. The frogman is so freaked out.
*  He's literally trying to climb the line back up.
*  He's like total panic at the disco, right? And the helicopter's like,
*  do we do it like an emergency ascent? What the hell's going on here?
*  And right as this thing is about, and by the way,
*  it's the size of a small island and round,
*  right as this thing is about to break the surface,
*  it sucks the missile down and disappears. And that was, yeah.
*  And, uh, Dave Fravor could probably tell you that story a little better than I
*  can. Uh, but when you compare that to other things, you gotta say,
*  imagine being that guy hanging from that line.
*  No, thank you. We call that bait.
*  Yeah, but it didn't do anything to him. No, I would have loved that experience.
*  Yeah. So that was, uh,
*  that was one of the anecdotes that was revealed to us by one of the
*  who's that guy that was hanging from the frogman. I don't know.
*  I only know the bro. Come, come talk to me. Please.
*  I only know the pilot. Well, put you in a panda outfit.
*  Disguise your voice. Tell me what the fuck you saw. I want to hear that story.
*  Oh my God. Small island. Yep.
*  Black is the devil in a small island and round submarines look like this,
*  right? They're not round. Right. So, yeah. So that was, uh,
*  that was one of the anecdotes that was shared with us. Um, you know,
*  obviously Puerto Rico with the, uh, other,
*  there's been some UAPs that have been recorded off there.
*  Everybody knows about the Aguadilla incident. I don't know about it.
*  Oh, I'm sure you do. You don't know. Tell me. Wow. Trust me.
*  So you can look it up online.
*  There's a video taken by a DHS helicopter of a very interesting object.
*  At first it appears to be like a, perhaps a balloon,
*  but then it does all sorts of weird stuff. And as you're tracking it,
*  it enters the water without making a splash. You can track it underwater.
*  Then it comes up and splits into two and it's called,
*  and it's been analyzed over and over again by a lot of experts.
*  It's called the Aguadilla incident.
*  Maybe I have seen this. Is it kind of blurry looking night vision?
*  That's it. Oh wow. And so keep watching that.
*  And I'll tell you a little story about this. Uh,
*  this is a customs and border protection release this.
*  How fast is this thing going?
*  Well, so if you look here, they're looking at this through a form of night vision.
*  I don't know the exact velocity. All that is available,
*  but if you keep watching this, something interesting happens. So here it goes,
*  you're going to see this thing enter the water here. There he goes underwater.
*  And then it pops back up and splits into two, keep their track and it see no
*  waves, no wake.
*  And then it surfaces and then, uh, does something pretty,
*  pretty interesting here. So keep watching.
*  So it's going high speed through the water underwater. That's underwater.
*  Then it breaks the surface of the water again. Keep watching. Boom, underwater,
*  over water, boom underwater,
*  underwater. And then you'll see it split into two. So,
*  I didn't see it split into two. If you watch the rest of the video, the video,
*  there it is. Yeah. The video is actually really long, but that's just one example.
*  Um, you know, this is, uh, these are, you can see all these videos. They're,
*  they're prevalent everywhere. You see that the eight,
*  the aircraft on the bottom, right? You see the UAP on top that's tracking it.
*  Yeah. No wings, no control services. Uh,
*  and it keeps up with the eight 10 and does all sorts of interesting maneuvers,
*  right? So that's an eight 10 warthog.
*  And this thing is just following it. Yep. Like it's nothing.
*  Do you think they're trying to let people see them?
*  Like if you had to guess, you know, I, I don't know. I mean,
*  could it be a demonstration of capabilities? We do that, right?
*  Every time a Russian surveillance aircraft comes by,
*  we launched two F 22s and we get real close to it and say, Hey, you know,
*  right. But not even from a military perspective,
*  like if a civilization was trying to alert another civilization about its
*  presence, wouldn't it like go towards whatever military vehicles it has and,
*  and show itself.
*  And then I would imagine that if they understand human beings,
*  they understand our psychology and they understand that some giant size of an
*  island, black as the devil circular craft that lands next to the Pentagon would
*  fucking end the world. We would freak out. No one would know what to do.
*  That would be stock market crash, mass chaos.
*  No one would know what to do.
*  I think the way to introduce yourself,
*  I would imagine would be gradual over a long period of time to allow these,
*  this civilization to accept the fact these things exist and then slowly but
*  surely show versions of themselves.
*  Yeah. We call that sensitive sensitization. You sensitize,
*  the population or environment. But you know,
*  the counter argument to that is that's a very human thing, right? We have,
*  as humans, we, we always, it's, it's almost innate.
*  We look at everything through anthropomorphic eyes. We, we look at,
*  you know, our, our pet dogs and we give them human names and we do things like
*  that because we assign human value to things because we have intentions and
*  motivations. But most of nature isn't that way. Like for example,
*  when a shark bites a surfer, he's not wanting to hurt the surfer.
*  He's just hungry. The shark's hungry. I don't care if you're a seal or whatever,
*  you know, I don't want to, I'm not trying to inflict pain.
*  I'm just want to feed my belly. Intent and motivation is a very human thing.
*  And we have to, we have to,
*  I don't want to say resist the urge because it's almost impossible to do it,
*  but we have to recognize that there are,
*  there are things that may exist that aren't, don't have human motivation.
*  Meaning maybe they don't care about sensitizing us. Maybe they do,
*  but maybe it's like a, like a computer, right? Maybe it's binary.
*  Maybe there's some sort of binary thought process,
*  just information in and, and information out. So that's the one,
*  one of the aspects I've always been very careful with is to assign human traits
*  to something that is very likely not human, right?
*  But would you have to assign human traits to it or would you have, if you,
*  you could look at it from the perspective of these things are aware of our
*  psychology.
*  They're aware of how we function and they're aware of the fragility of our
*  worldview. No, great point.
*  You don't have to have human intention to have a strategy for
*  doing the least amount of harm to this emerging civilization.
*  Touche. In fact, there's examples of that.
*  Let me reinforce your point because there's examples of that in my background
*  being science in nature. You know, when lionesses stalk the zebras,
*  you know, they get very low into the grass. They don't want to be seen, right?
*  They're not motivated necessarily cause they don't want to spook the herd,
*  but they do it. It's, it's, it's a, it's almost instinctual, right?
*  It's part of their DNA, part of their wiring to have a low profile,
*  low observability and to get closer to their target,
*  whether it's prey or anything else. So you're right. That mean there is,
*  there are examples in nature that also can suggest that. So it's,
*  it's a very good point.
*  Yeah. I mean, it just makes sense that if it understands us, if it's absurd,
*  look, we understand the behavior characteristics of sloths, right? Right.
*  We, we've studied them. We know what they do.
*  And it would just make sense that if they're studying us,
*  they would understand our behavior characteristics.
*  I mean, the tiger recognizes the behavior characteristics of the zebra,
*  doesn't it? Right. Exactly. It studies it.
*  And so it knows what it has to do to get close to the zebra. So yeah,
*  there's no way they would come here with ignorance.
*  And I think also it's very likely that what we are exists in many,
*  many places in the universe and that what we are is what they used to be.
*  So they probably understand what we are.
*  Well, we do that in the Amazon, don't we? And in, in, in African tribes,
*  there's lost tribes that are remote, right?
*  Separated by outside human contact. We study them. We study them from afar,
*  but we do the same thing. Yes. Yeah. No, no question. And obviously,
*  if they are the super intelligent creatures,
*  they evolved to become super intelligent creatures.
*  So there's probably some sort of a universal process that takes place amongst
*  all intelligent creative life that has a lust for innovation.
*  They consistently make better and better versions of these flying crafts until
*  they figure out how to make this warp drive thing that these things apparently
*  have.
*  Another thing that's odd is that you see the same kind of things that Kenneth
*  Arnold saw in 1950. You see the same kind of things today.
*  It's almost like, you know,
*  going somewhere in the 1950s and seeing a 55 Chevy and then in
*  2024 seen another 55. They're still driving around in 55 Chevys. Like,
*  what the fuck? Well, they do do that in Cuba, right?
*  But that's just because they don't have access to other cars.
*  Really good mechanics. That's your people.
*  It is. It's my, I'm really resisting the urge of continuing to smoke this thing
*  right now. Okay. I feel terrible. Don't feel terrible.
*  My wife is going to give me hell for this because I told her anything wrong with
*  cigars, man. Like I was saying before,
*  I never heard of a single person dying from cigars. You don't nail them.
*  Take a little bit of smoke in your mouth. It's pleasurable.
*  It's nice. Um,
*  I would just think that that's what they would do because that's what we would
*  do. And I think that's what intelligent life would do.
*  We've recognized something that wasn't quite as intelligent as us.
*  We don't rush into these, you know,
*  remote tribes and vaccinate them. What do we do? We don't give them,
*  but the thing is like they have done some things like they gave Starlink to this
*  one tribe and the kids all started watching porn. You hear about that?
*  Yeah. It became a real problem. They're all lazy,
*  hanging out on their phones all day, which makes sense. That's what we do.
*  Yeah. But tribal leaders are not happy.
*  You bring up another very interesting point.
*  Is there a natural glide slope or a natural evolution
*  to evolution? Meaning any species that reaches a certain point,
*  is there a natural progression of any intelligent species to progress to the
*  point? Like his all life is expansive. Right? Life doesn't contract.
*  Life expands, whether it's bacterial life, whether it's animal life or human life.
*  It is, there are certain biological functions to procreate, multiply,
*  and continue to expand. Right? So is that a, is that a universal norm? That is,
*  is, is that part of like fractals and geometry throughout the universe?
*  Is that part of the blueprint of all life or is it only specific to life here on
*  earth? And that's a great question because there's probably arguments to suggest
*  that, yeah, there probably is a natural,
*  there's a natural blueprint for physics in the universe.
*  There probably, since life has to abide by physics,
*  probably a natural, potentially natural blueprint for the evolution of all life,
*  whether again, bacterial or animal or human or anything else, non-human.
*  It makes sense.
*  It makes sense that everything moves into greater levels of complexity from
*  single celled organisms to human beings that pilot drones.
*  It just keeps going in the same general direction observably here.
*  And if the universe is infinite,
*  that means there's infinite versions of what we're seeing here with us that
*  exists throughout the cosmos and probably in infinite steps along the way.
*  Right? Right. A hundred years from now, thousand years from now.
*  Well, not to make light of it, but I'll tell you recently, so I've,
*  I've learned over the years it's, it's,
*  there's nothing more expensive than a, than a cheap lawyer.
*  So I've got a couple good lawyers that I,
*  that I work with on just contractual stuff.
*  And one of them is named Ivan Hanel. I call him the bull.
*  And I've learned to appreciate the, shout out to Ivan,
*  the infinite complexity of law and legal. Right? So, right.
*  So if there is this natural progression, as we're talking about life, I mean,
*  we even see it in our, in our own human interactions, right? This, this,
*  this intricate complexity of how things work and how,
*  even in the way we behave with each other socially, right?
*  You look at a, when I was in the, in the government,
*  you could look at a terrorist link analysis and that link analysis still
*  follows those fractal patterns that the patterns in our, our, our lungs,
*  the patterns of lightning, the patterns of super medulonic clouds and galaxies,
*  super clusters of galaxies all have that same pattern.
*  And it's not just a physical pattern. It's a social pattern. Right. And so again,
*  I not to make joke of it, but I've, you know, I'm learning that it's,
*  it's beyond these patterns are beyond just physical patterns, you know,
*  even in something as, as, as, as silly, but fundamental as law,
*  there are these patterns that continue to spin off and whatnot. So, um, yeah,
*  I can appreciate that. I think,
*  I think we're at a point now as a species where we probably should be having
*  these conversations. And I'll also say this, Joe,
*  there are parts of this conversation.
*  I don't feel the government has any place.
*  There is definitely a national security conversation here,
*  but the conversation we're having as you can tell is far beyond national
*  security, right? We're talking philosophical, psychological, sociological,
*  theological implications that I'm not sure I want my government necessarily
*  dictating for me what I should think about this.
*  Well, the government's supposed to be working for us ultimately,
*  and they are supposed to be us, you know,
*  and the problem is when you have access to information that's above and beyond
*  the normal person's realm that could affect everyone on this planet,
*  this understanding that we are not alone, but not only that,
*  we're probably not even alone here. It's not even that something is visiting us.
*  Something's probably here all the time, you know,
*  and this is the main thought about these underwater vehicles.
*  Well, life is abundant on this planet, isn't it?
*  And it thrives in places that we thought life could never thrive before.
*  It's it's everywhere. It's almost seems like a natural function.
*  If you have certain situations and circumstances on a rock somewhere,
*  then life pops up.
*  It seems like if we can actually find it on Mars and they're like you were
*  saying before,
*  they may have found some sort of an evidence of microbiological life.
*  If we find it on Mars and we find it somewhere,
*  they think maybe Europa underneath the surface. That's right. That's right.
*  And Europa probably is powered by volcanic vents the same way the bottom bar
*  ocean is. There might be some sort of life form there.
*  Chemosynthesis, not photosynthesis.
*  And this is just what we know about here. You know,
*  imagine all the different potential realities in terms of what a planet's
*  atmosphere could be like. You know,
*  you're dealing with larger planets that have more gravity.
*  You're dealing with different kinds of temperature variations.
*  Look at Titan. It's got a meth, it's methane. And by the way,
*  that's organic chemistry. It's got methane clouds. Right. Right.
*  So there are things that thrive in these types of environments.
*  They have cow farts up there too.
*  Yeah, there are too many. But yeah, I mean, you're, you're,
*  you're absolutely correct. I think we have, again,
*  this goes back to the original point of every time we try to put mother nature
*  in a box,
*  she always finds a way to wiggle her way out of it and prove us wrong.
*  If the one thing we're right about is that we're always wrong. Right.
*  How much, I don't know if you could talk about this,
*  but how much of an effort is there to try to detect things under the surface of
*  the ocean?
*  I would defer that to the United States Navy and maybe Noah,
*  no oceanographic. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  I mean, no, I mean, that far back national oceanographic and, uh,
*  and atmospheric speaking to going that far back. I mean, how much of,
*  I gotta think that when people are delving into the stuff,
*  they look at ancient scriptures and ancient,
*  these different depictions of things, whether it's the Vyamanas,
*  uh, in the Hindu texts and whether it's the, in the Bhagavad Gita,
*  there's all these different stories of in Ezekiel in the Bible.
*  There's things that seem to,
*  if I was a person living thousands of years ago and I encountered a flying
*  saucer or encountered some spaceship from another planet,
*  I would probably describe it in a way that they're describing it. Yeah. I mean,
*  I mean, like just like sort of the, the Aztecs today's magic is,
*  is tomorrow's technology, right? Um, so I can tell you, when I went to Italy,
*  I spoke to one of the senior, I think it was a Monsignor,
*  one of the senior Vatican academics. And he said to me, he says, look,
*  the Vatican doesn't have problem with this topic. This is something in fact,
*  in the sixth up into the 1600s,
*  it was heretical to presume or assume that mankind was the only,
*  if you will, incarnation of God, representation of God. It was actually,
*  but in essence,
*  you're putting limitations on the dominion of what God can and can't do.
*  And there are these scrolls in fact,
*  that are in the Vatican archives that discuss,
*  it's a conversation between a Roman soldier and a Roman general where they
*  describe there's something called Eclipse. Eclipse in Latin means, um,
*  like sun eclipse, right? It's the shape of the Roman shield.
*  And they talked about these flaming Roman shields in the sky that would follow
*  them from battle space to battle space.
*  And Mr Jacques Vallee could probably expound much more upon that than I can,
*  but this was just a brief conversation I had with, with someone there.
*  Jacques Vallee is very slippery. Very slippery.
*  He don't commit to anything. He looks at you sideways.
*  Yeah. He, uh, you know, he's, he did a lot of, a lot of good stuff.
*  And he's an incredibly smart guy. Great, great researcher of just phenomenal,
*  you know, big brain.
*  He's the reason that guy in close encounters with the third kind, the guy,
*  he's the inspiration for the French guy.
*  I heard that. I never had the guts to ask him. I figured he gets tired of that.
*  I'm sure it's when you're talking to him, the guy, the guy, but, um, you know,
*  there's, there's, there's a lot of, and when you look at what the Vatican is,
*  I mean, really it's probably the world's oldest,
*  most capable intelligence organization because they have priests around the
*  world that people will report miracles to, right. And,
*  and confessions to, and eventually that gets filtered up to the Vatican. So,
*  you know, talk about, you know, the world's first CIA and KGB, it was,
*  it was Vatican baby. Those guys had a, had it going on. And so no wonder,
*  they have all this archival, excuse me, archival information.
*  And some of it relates to UAP.
*  Wow. Yeah,
*  it only makes sense that these things, if they're here now,
*  they've probably been visiting us since back when we're on horseback. Yeah.
*  And probably quite a bit before then.
*  And maybe that's the scariest thing for people.
*  They might be responsible for us being humans in the first place.
*  Well, you remember the stories, right?
*  If even Christopher Columbus coming over to the new world,
*  there were some interesting accounts when they're on the water of potentially
*  some sort of UAP interaction. I did not know that. Yeah.
*  You can look it up online. This is all open source, but you can type it up.
*  And there were some very interesting accounts and even, you know, old, old,
*  old sailor accounts, you know, of, of, you know, people say, well, you know,
*  old sailors also talked about, you know, big giant crack and stuff like that,
*  but there was always an element of truth to it. Now we realize there are giant
*  squid of the Pacific.
*  Well not only that crack ins they think likely did exist. Yeah. Well they,
*  because octopus when they brought, they don't leave anything,
*  but they did find fossilized suction cups from the still do.
*  It's called the great squid of the Pacific. We find you. Yeah, that,
*  that for sure. But they think maybe perhaps even an enormous octopus.
*  Yeah. That probably actually did go after boats. You know, we call it,
*  we, we called them sea monsters back then, but really, you know, we,
*  we laugh about it now, but it turns out there are sea monsters.
*  There's just called great white sharks and you know, that's a fucking sea monster.
*  Right. You know, the real thing of great white shark is now, I mean,
*  absolutely go swimming with a great white shark and tell me that's not a monster.
*  Right. Exactly. So, um, you know, it's, we just realize, Oh,
*  it's just part of nature. It's part of our existing paradigm.
*  Tigers are monsters. Right. Absolutely. You know,
*  especially at night when you don't have a flashlight,
*  that thing behind the bush, that's monster. Right. Right. Um,
*  did you find anything on the Columbus stuff?
*  One thing I'm seeing is from my ancient aliens episode.
*  You know, it's legit. It's all crashed. Something crashed into the water,
*  but I can't find. Yeah.
*  There was some reports of some interesting lights that the crew had reported and
*  it was actually, he put it down in his log book, something about some interest.
*  Now some folks will come back and say, well, that's St. Elmo's fire,
*  which absolutely could be, you know, St. Elmo's fire is a static charge.
*  It occurs on the wingtips of aircraft.
*  Even the old sailors would report it in certain environmental conditions.
*  There was this weird greenish blue plasma glow that will often
*  sometimes be seen on the tips of wing tips on aircraft. You could,
*  it's actually, there's some really good pictures of it online.
*  And even on the old Mariner ships up towards the sails and the mass,
*  and they believe it's, it's, um,
*  it has to do with a static charge and under certain environments, um,
*  it creates this, this energized plasma and you can see it. And so,
*  is that similar to like ball lightning?
*  Well, it could be, here you go. So, um, and they call it St. Elmo's fire.
*  See that fucking bad-ass. Yeah. And so that's, yeah,
*  it's either around the cockpit of the aircraft. Whoa.
*  And by the way, you see the patterns, it's fractal, right? Look at that ship.
*  So very, very interesting how St. Elmo's fire, you know,
*  can cause some people to, you know,
*  perhaps see things and say it's also, they might be seeing that. Yeah.
*  They might, right? But there,
*  there are some accounts of ancient Mariners who report strange, bizarre things.
*  Yeah. Again, it makes sense. Um,
*  that was one of the more weird parts of Bob Lazar's, uh,
*  story was that, uh, they've always been here and that they,
*  they view us as containers.
*  Containers. Interesting. Yeah.
*  And he said there's a very thick document that relays to the,
*  the implications that it has on religion and like what, what they,
*  the way they talk about us. Well, religion calls us vessels, right? Yeah.
*  Religious scripture and a lot of different religions refer to humans as,
*  as vessels. You know, I'm certainly not a religious expert, so I, you know,
*  I don't want to pontificate here and say something that's inaccurate, but you know,
*  that, that doesn't surprise me. Well, I think that the term was,
*  I think they were saying vessels for souls,
*  but if you imagine that a being transcends its physical limitations of
*  biological reality, right?
*  So the biological evolution that led us to become homo sapiens over the course of,
*  you know, X amount of millions of years, that's a very slow process,
*  but technological innovation and technological progress is very quick,
*  very quick, especially when you add in artificial intelligence,
*  exponential.
*  So if something comes along that is a life form that exists outside of biology,
*  like something that we create, which it seems like we're doing right now,
*  like AI, right? When does that become sentient? Now is that a life form?
*  You know, not biological.
*  That thing in order for it to ever occur,
*  maybe that thing needs a thing with a soul that has a creative desire that has a
*  a lust for innovation and continues to make better and better things.
*  And maybe that thing only exists in biology and maybe the problem with artificial
*  life is that it has no motivation and that we have,
*  it's especially if it's self programmable, right?
*  So one of the very bizarre things that was recently discovered about artificial
*  intelligence,
*  artificial intelligence,
*  they gave artificial intelligence a certain amount of time to,
*  to code something, to figure something out.
*  And when it didn't have enough time,
*  it changed its code to give itself more time.
*  Fascinating.
*  Yeah. Like what the fuck you talking about?
*  It is deciding that it doesn't like its limitations.
*  So it won't have any of the biological motivation we have,
*  right? It won't have ego.
*  It won't have materialism.
*  It won't have a desire for status.
*  It won't have all the things that lead us to do some of the horrible things that
*  human beings do.
*  I could not agree more.
*  And also some of the great things that human beings do,
*  but maybe it also doesn't have any desire to create.
*  And maybe the only way for its kind of life to exist is for a human being,
*  a biological thing that's super intelligent in comparison to the rest of the
*  animals on this planet that innovates to the point where it creates this
*  artificial life.
*  I'm going to share something very, very personal with you.
*  And I know when I say with you, I know it's with everybody else,
*  but you know,
*  part of my struggle is I can't,
*  I can't urge the government to be transparent and I'm not transparent myself.
*  Right. It's hypocritical.
*  So let me share with you a very personal story because you bring something up
*  that I think is fascinating.
*  I'm a human being,
*  but if for whatever reason I get into a car accident and I lose an arm,
*  I'm still Lou Elizondo. Right. In fact,
*  if I lose my legs and all my arms, I'm still Lou.
*  So my body doesn't define who I am and my intellect, right.
*  If I suffer a traumatic brain injury,
*  let's say I'm in Afghanistan and a TBI and my,
*  my, my brain is compromised.
*  I'm still Lou. And so, so what makes Lou, what makes Joe Joe?
*  Well, it's not, not your physical self and probably not even your intellectual
*  self. My, my mother, I was very close to my mother.
*  My mother was, was, was incredible human being.
*  And I'll share this story with you and take away with it what you want.
*  I was very young, maybe two, two and a half, three years old.
*  And I remember watching a show with my mother, one of my very first memories.
*  And in this TV show, I don't remember what show it was,
*  but I remember that a shark had eaten a dog and I was shocked.
*  My first understanding that what death was.
*  And I looked at my mom and said, mom, what just happened? And she said, well,
*  son, the shark ate the dog. So what does that mean? She says, well,
*  the dog's not coming back. The dog died. And I said, well, does everything die?
*  She said, well, yes, son, everything dies. I said, well, mom, you're not,
*  you're not going to die. You're a mom, right? You gave me life. She says, no,
*  son, one day I'm going to die. And I remember spending from that day forward,
*  as God is my witness, I spent every single day of my life knowing one day
*  my mother was going to die. And it terrified me. I was very,
*  very close with her. And
*  one day that day came, my mother was diagnosed with cancer.
*  And she started,
*  her body started failing. And despite the best efforts, she,
*  we knew she wasn't going to make it. And you know,
*  when you love somebody sometimes,
*  it doesn't sound right, but sometimes you deceive them. You know,
*  they want to know they're in a bad state physically and mentally and say,
*  you know, am I going to make it? And you say, yeah, of course you're going to
*  make it right. Knowing full well that there's probably not good chance you're
*  going to make it. And so we're in the hospital and
*  my mother had at this point been in probably a state of coma for about a week.
*  And it was just me and my wife and a couple members of the family.
*  A very, very sad moment. And
*  my mother began this process of death called, you know,
*  when someone's going to die, there's something called a death rattle.
*  And it's when the mucus begins in the back of the throat to,
*  to congeal and it makes breathing,
*  it can be very unnerving for the people who have to witnesses. It's very,
*  very common. It's called a death rattle.
*  It's the body beginning to shut down.
*  And I knew something told me my mom,
*  my mom was going to go very quickly within the next 30 seconds to a minute.
*  So long story short, my mother's body was at that point,
*  it was a husk and empty husk. It was broken.
*  Her brain had shut down and yet the very moment she passed away within five
*  seconds, I knew it. It was just something weird. Something reached and said,
*  this is it. She's going.
*  And I reached over the bed and I looked at my mom,
*  her eyes all of a sudden opened up and she looked right at me.
*  And even though her brain had been compromised and wasn't working,
*  her body was, was, was nothing anymore. And she was a beautiful woman. She was,
*  she was, she was, she worked for Playboy.
*  She was a beautiful lady at one time, a model. She was,
*  her body resembled nothing of what she did.
*  She looked at me and she passed,
*  but we communicated and I knew there was something else at that moment more to a
*  human being more than just a body, more than just a brain.
*  There is something that is,
*  that is beyond the physical and even intellectual part of what it means to be
*  human. And I felt it and everybody in the room felt it. It was undeniable.
*  You can call it a soul and it achieve whatever, you know,
*  you can put a label on it. I don't know what it's called.
*  I don't know what it is, but I do know that was the essence of my mother.
*  And the moment she passed,
*  it was this weird feeling because as my mother laid there dead in the bed,
*  it wasn't my mother anymore. That essence, whatever made my mother,
*  my mother, and you could see the light in her eyes.
*  It was like someone turning off the light switch is very,
*  and I've been around death a lot. It'd never be, you know,
*  it's a terrible, horrible thing, especially in warfare, but,
*  but this was something, something visceral.
*  This was something far more intimate. This was this cut to my soul.
*  And I could recognize it and she recognized me and I recognize her,
*  even though that the brain functions were gone. So,
*  so I guess my point is I absolutely believe there's something more to the human
*  experience and simply a tangible body and in a brain.
*  And I, and I witnessed this firsthand.
*  Now people can say all sorts of stuff they want to, you know, I don't care,
*  you know, I got enough haters out there anyways, you know,
*  if they want to think that I'm trying to, you know,
*  hope that my mother has a soul and she goes somewhere.
*  I'm just telling you what I experienced and other people experience too.
*  And it was, it was proof for me at that moment that there's much more to,
*  to us as, as, as human beings.
*  I had a very similar feeling when I went to my grandfather's funeral and I saw
*  him in the casket.
*  Cause it was, it was an open casket and I knew he's gone.
*  I'm like, that's not him. That's right. It's just a shelf.
*  And you can sense it.
*  You feel it. Yeah. It was a very strange feeling. Yeah. You know,
*  and obviously he's wearing makeup because they've got him in a suit and the
*  whole deal. But I was like, that is not my grandfather. He's not there anymore.
*  And it's not like you're trying to override this acknowledgement that they're
*  dead. You know, they're dead. It's just that whatever made that person,
*  that person, it's not in the body. Right. It's gone.
*  There's a bizarre feeling that we have that you don't,
*  you don't think his words for it.
*  Yeah. No, I, it's a feeling. It is. And you can, and it's, again,
*  it's not an intellectual or even a physical thing. Yeah.
*  That the idea that we're containers for souls is just so goddamn creepy.
*  This is a farm of souls.
*  I'm not familiar with that hypothesis, but it sounds interesting.
*  Also scary perhaps.
*  Well, it's scary for us because you know, but
*  like you w you gotta wonder why we are so different than every other creature in
*  that we have this insane insatiable desire to change our environment,
*  constantly build bigger skyscrapers and to move the earth and we're constantly
*  inventing new technology. I mean,
*  it seems to be an instinct that's a part of us.
*  And I agree this gradual progression of life is life goes from intelligent
*  biological life to super intelligent, whatever it is, whatever,
*  whatever kind of technology creates it,
*  that life is not as simple as
*  this natural selection model that we have here that we think applies to life that
*  this is a type of life and then there's a life that this thing creates.
*  Well, you know, evolution isn't just a physical thing, is it?
*  Evolution is, is the ability to change within one's environment over,
*  over time. And that's a, that's a,
*  that's a fascinating concept you bring up because some speculate that it is
*  inevitable that human beings will eventually evolve into something.
*  We're just a link in a much longer chain and that's a,
*  a much longer chain and that all intelligent life potentially goes through
*  this process and that this is a natural process where eventually we actually make
*  ourselves extinct, not, not in the way where we kill ourselves,
*  but we wind up creating a life form,
*  whether it's AI or we start enhancing ourselves with more and more machine
*  interface and, and, and, and, you know,
*  life doesn't have to necessarily be organic, right? You could have potential.
*  I mean, Silicon is very, very close to carbon in some cases. So, you know,
*  is it possible that, that life it is,
*  it is destiny for all life eventually to evolve itself out of existence and
*  bring in or usher in a new type of life form? Is it possible? I mean,
*  certainly from a technological perspective, I mean, ask Elon Musk,
*  it seems that we're, you know,
*  we're making a lot of advancements right now to augment the human experience.
*  And given, as you said, how technology progresses exponentially,
*  very quickly in the next 200 years, I mean, we might be there.
*  Is this sort of conversation being had in the government about what these
*  things potentially are?
*  I not to my knowledge, and I sure hope not,
*  because I don't think the government, this is a conversation.
*  This is where I go back to,
*  this is a conversation that involves a lot of people, you know,
*  whether it's your, your priest or your rabbi or your imam,
*  or it is your philosophy teacher at the university. I think,
*  I think we're getting into an area now that is beyond national security.
*  And I'm honestly, Joe,
*  I'm not comfortable with my government taking that aspect on because
*  frankly, I don't trust my government to manage what I should think about
*  something. Tell me what is I'm okay with. Right.
*  Don't tell me how to think about it. Don't tell me how to process that,
*  you know, because now you're, now you're overstepping your bounds.
*  It's also other human beings. The government is just human beings.
*  Human beings shouldn't have this insane knowledge and keep it from other human
*  beings. Well, in fact, it's, it's not, it's illegal, especially in our democracy.
*  There's this type of stuff is supposed to be discussed with certain members of
*  Congress and certain elements of the executive branch. And when somebody,
*  I don't care if you're in the government or in a religion or anything like that,
*  this goes to the, to the fundamental pillar of something that,
*  that agrees me, which is corruption. Now, when I say corruption, let me,
*  let me backtrack a little bit. My father recently died. This, this, uh,
*  last father's day, not this one, but the one before. And, um,
*  I had the privilege of, of knowing he was sick.
*  And so we took a road trip down to Miami, um,
*  about a month and a half before he died. And he never told me he was sick, but,
*  but I knew something was, wasn't right. I knew my father for a long time and
*  something wasn't right. He started losing weight and I could see he wasn't
*  eating as much. And there were telltale signs and he didn't want to tell me.
*  And I asked my father almost, almost flippantly. I said, dad,
*  I think we're probably somewhere by St. Louis. And I said, dad,
*  what is the greatest threat to humanity, to humans? What is the greatest threat?
*  Now I say flippantly cause I'm thinking, you know, terrorism, right?
*  And this and that my father thought for a second, he looks at me and says, son,
*  it's corruption. I said, what do you mean corruption? Like, like, like,
*  financial corruption, governmental corruption. He says, no,
*  corruption at its heart is when you are willing to
*  bypass your own moral code, your own ethics for something else.
*  And whether it's, it's financial corruption, religious corruption,
*  governmental corruption, or even moral corruption.
*  When you start to compromise on your own values,
*  it's a very quick downward spiral to, to utter chaos.
*  And he know that firsthand cause my father was in the Bay of Pigs invasion.
*  He was a political prisoner of Castro.
*  He actually fought with Castro against Batista.
*  And then when Castro went communist,
*  my father joined the folks here and the friendly folks at the CIA and was part
*  of the invasion of the Bay of Pigs.
*  He spent two years in Castro's prisons being tortured.
*  So when he came to this country,
*  this country offered us opportunities that no other country could or would.
*  And the reason why Cuba failed was because of corruption. And he said, look,
*  corruption will be the end of all. And, and if,
*  if it's a very quick downward spiral with democracy,
*  that if democracy becomes corrupt, you now have tyranny, right?
*  And so every time someone in the government is willing to compromise a little
*  bit on the value of what it means to serve the American people,
*  and they forget that they become corrupt.
*  And that actually erodes the very essence of what democracy is and what this
*  country is about. And that is why it is so important.
*  That the individuals in our government that don't want to have this
*  conversation and don't want to talk to Congress and are making the unilateral
*  decision on your behalf and the American taxpayer in my behalf, that's wrong.
*  They don't have the right to do that.
*  There is a process of rules and laws we have in this country that we've all
*  agreed to are going to abide by. And that includes them.
*  And they don't have the right to bypass that.
*  Even if they think they're doing it for the right reason, I disagree with that.
*  I think, I think this democracy only works because we all agree it works.
*  Right. And the moment you begin to compromise on that, all of democracy is
*  at risk. And I mean that sincerely.
*  It's not a slow downward spiral.
*  It's quick. And you can hit rock bottom very, very quickly.
*  And the only reason why this government works is because we all have faith and
*  commitment to what we consider are the American values and serving the American
*  people and for the people by the people.
*  So I think it's very dangerous when elements in the government.
*  And I don't want to I don't want to villainize the whole government because
*  the government's full of great people. They do great things.
*  They keep us safe. So I'm talking about the minority few.
*  Some of these people who have actually gone after me and will probably continue
*  to come after me to try to discredit me and everything else, despite the volumes
*  of documentation that I have in my possession and others, because they don't
*  want to have the conversation and they are happy with the status quo.
*  And to me, that is a greater threat than any UAP could ever have on humanity.
*  It's it's the greatest threat is how we perceive ourselves and what we are willing
*  to do to keep this a secret in violation of the commitment and and and what we
*  have done to we've sworn in some cases to uphold the values of this country.
*  And I think that's a concern for me.
*  And that's why I don't want certain elements having this conversation of what
*  this means. You know, the bigger macro level conversation, because I don't think
*  they're qualified. I'm not qualified.
*  I know that. I'm damn sure they're not qualified here.
*  So this is why I think this type of national level conversation is so important.
*  At the end of the day, it's not up to me.
*  People say, Lou, what do you think? You know, it's hell what I think.
*  Doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what you think.
*  Here's the information. Here's the data.
*  You figure it out. Don't ask me for what this means, because I'm not entitled to
*  that. I didn't I didn't earn that privilege.
*  And I would definitely never take it away because that is that is that is sacred.
*  That's you. That's up to you to decide for yourself.
*  And this is this is part of my frustration with this overall conversation,
*  because there are elements that don't want you to have this conversation.
*  Well said, Lou. Thank you very much, man.
*  Thanks for being here. I really enjoyed it.
*  Really enjoyed our conversation.
*  Joe, this has been fantastic and truly, truly an honor and privilege.
*  You have one hell of a responsibility.
*  You are you are. Look, I got to tell you, I don't ever get nervous doing an interview.
*  You were the first one and probably the only one I will ever have been
*  nervous coming in just simply because not because of me, because of you,
*  the responsibilities you have on your shoulders to have a communicate.
*  You reach a global audience.
*  People are listening to this conversation right now.
*  And by the way, they're part of this conversation.
*  Very much so. Right.
*  That is an enormous responsibility.
*  You have a voice in some cases that exceeds presidents.
*  The technology you now have available to your fingertips and this wonderful staff
*  you have, you are influencing the world.
*  And I can't imagine that type of responsibility.
*  I mean, there are world leaders that don't have the voice you have.
*  And so for me, it is a profound, profound honor and privilege to be with you here
*  today and your wonderful audience.
*  You know, if I never see you again, I wish you the best of luck.
*  You are you're doing America a great service.
*  Be honest, be candid, speak your mind.
*  That's all I can say as a little chicken here in the United States.
*  You you've got big shoulders, man.
*  You got a big weight on a lot of responsibility on your back.
*  And I mean, that's freaking me out, man.
*  Tell you. But thank you very much.
*  Thanks again. I really appreciate everything you've said.
*  And I appreciate your everything you said about disclosure and how important it is.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  Joe, it's been my honor and privilege sincerely.
*  My honor, too. Thank you very much. Yes, sir.
*  All right. Bye, everybody.
