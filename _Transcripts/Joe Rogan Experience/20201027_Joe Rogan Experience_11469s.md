# Joe Rogan Experience #1555 - Alex Jones & Tim Dillon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVso9FSkmE)
*  Joe Rogan Podcast, checking out the Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day.
*  Young Jamie, back in the fucking saddle.
*  How you feeling? Very well, thank you.
*  Covid free, four days in a row now. I've kicked it.
*  Yeah, and now you still can't taste anything?
*  Well, I started to come back today, but yeah, like 5% taste.
*  Yeah, it's got to be.
*  Pickle juice doesn't even taste like anything.
*  Really? It just tastes like water?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  Whoa. Very weird.
*  But you don't have any residual symptoms? Nothing wrong?
*  I'm good. I can breathe everything.
*  Good to see you back.
*  Oh, too. Good.
*  We're a little worried about you.
*  Thanks.
*  We're a little worried about you.
*  Not worried about you.
*  Alex Jones.
*  This is the most anticipated thing I ever did.
*  I've probably had, no exaggeration, two or three thousand people in the last year and a half ask me,
*  when are you going back on Joe Rogan?
*  And I'm always saying, I don't know, I don't know.
*  And then I learned you were moving here like three, four months ago and now we're here and this is exciting.
*  I don't get butterflies anymore, but I actually have them here and this is great.
*  It's good to have butterflies after about 20 years.
*  Didn't get it the last two times I was on.
*  Didn't get it when I interviewed Trump.
*  Didn't get in a lot of things, but I've got butterflies here today.
*  Tim, motherfucking Tim.
*  Yeah, I'm just a kid in a candy store.
*  Me too.
*  Thank you for making this dream come true.
*  This is what I've always wanted to do and we've made it happen.
*  This is my make-a-wish. I can die happy.
*  Well, I'm happy you're here.
*  Yeah, I got my free Ghislaine shirt because I believe all women.
*  Is that how you say it?
*  It's, I think so, yeah.
*  I thought it was Ghislaine.
*  I thought it was Ghislaine.
*  It might be Ghislaine.
*  It's Ghislaine.
*  Do you know?
*  Look at me.
*  No, I'm...
*  Ghislaine?
*  It's Ghislaine.
*  Ghislaine?
*  That's a ridiculous name.
*  Yeah.
*  Her father was a famous MI6 Mossad spy that reportedly used sex operatives to control people.
*  He died being thrown off a yacht in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
*  And of course, she got caught in that farmhouse on the East Coast and she was really the pimp
*  over Epstein in a giant sex network ring over scientists that they were compromising
*  so they could control not just government but industry and science.
*  And so that was the master blackmail operation they were running.
*  And her sisters are big in tech.
*  Like Isabel Maxwell, she has sisters that are in US tech companies.
*  I think two of her sisters were part of the creation of Magellan, which was that big search engine.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  They are a very powerful family and they have all kinds of different operations.
*  Her dad was the biggest publisher in England and also the biggest owner of private TV stations in England.
*  And when he died, it turned out he was a front basically for intelligence networks.
*  Now let me right off the bat say you were telling me about Epstein and this island years ago.
*  You were telling me long before anybody, I think you told me about him before his first arrest.
*  A long time ago I talked about how they have these islands, they fly, they compromise children.
*  But I learned all this from Ted Gunderson 20 plus years ago.
*  He was in line to be the FBI director.
*  He was the head of the FBI in Los Angeles.
*  He was a very famous FBI agent, even ran Cohen Telpro.
*  It's a civil rights movement.
*  He apologized for that before he died in 2011.
*  But he came out and he was the one that explained to me about how they use these blackmail rings, elements of the CIA, and foreign intelligence groups,
*  and how they would basically make people have sex with children to be part of these clubs and these cults they were setting up.
*  So I knew about all this from Ted Gunderson.
*  Were they young girls that, did they tell them these girls were underage or did they look like they were older?
*  Like this, the Borat movie where they supposedly got...
*  If you haven't seen it, it's very disappointing.
*  They set him up, I saw it.
*  They did set him up, but nothing happened.
*  They made it look like Giuliani was jerking off in front of this girl.
*  He was taking his mic off.
*  He would have to be the biggest savage on earth to jerk off in that situation.
*  And they also said that he inappropriately touched her back.
*  When he touched her back, I am not exaggerating, it was like this.
*  Right.
*  It was a couple of light taps on the back.
*  While she was close to him taking off his mic thing, he goes,
*  And he goes,
*  Thank you very much, dear.
*  And he goes,
*  Yes, I just need your name and your phone number.
*  And then she takes off his mic and then he leans back and he's tucking his shirt back.
*  Because he just pulled the mic off.
*  Right.
*  But he's lying on the bed to do it.
*  Now, if you're an old man, and I'm sure he's probably got a bad back, like that's probably how you would do it.
*  But any of us that have had to put the mics on our side and then you put it in your pants, up your shirt,
*  and then you've got to get it out.
*  That's what you do.
*  But it's worse than that.
*  Remember when he was playing the, who was the gay character he played like 10 years ago?
*  Bruno.
*  Bruno.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember Congressman Ron Paul at the time had run for president.
*  And he's in the hotel.
*  He goes, Oh, the light broke.
*  Please step into this room.
*  So there's no chair.
*  Ron Paul sits down and he's reading a newspaper.
*  And Bruno comes in and pulls his pants down and says, I want to have sex with you.
*  Now, that would be sexual assault if that was a man to a woman.
*  Ron Paul pushes him out of the way, goes out of the room.
*  And so this is what he does.
*  He's done this to other people.
*  It's his specialty is to say you're being interviewed.
*  Listen, let me just, before we go any further, I fucking love Baron Cohen.
*  I love him.
*  Comic genius.
*  I think he's brilliant.
*  I think he's amazing.
*  But his interpretation of what happened in the room with Rudy Giuliani, it's not accurate,
*  in my opinion.
*  Well, listen, I mean, in Who is America?
*  He's tapping her while she's touching him and removing his mic.
*  He does this little tap on her waist, but it's not creepy.
*  It's like an old man, like a little tap, tap, tap.
*  Right.
*  Like if you want to take it out of context, like, I don't know if there's more to it than
*  what we're seeing.
*  But let's go further.
*  Let's go further.
*  Right after this happens, Barat, Sachsberg Cohen runs in in panties and a bra saying,
*  have sex with me.
*  He's 15, she too old.
*  So this is, and Giuliani's like, what the, I'd have already, like, what is this?
*  Listen, my fucking 12 year old sense of humor loved it.
*  But the thing about it is they're making it seem like Giuliani was jerking off in front
*  of her.
*  And that's not, like, he lies back and he's tucking his pants.
*  Like, can we show the whole thing so we can look at it?
*  They put it out as promotional material.
*  What's that, Jamie?
*  We can watch it in here, but I'll be on because.
*  Well, let's just.
*  I mean, I think Jamie's right.
*  Because you're a big show.
*  They'll try to tag you.
*  But they're making it seem like it's not as promotional material to be promoted.
*  They put it out on Twitter.
*  The clip is on Miss Pat's.
*  Give a shout out to Miss Pat.
*  Jamie's technically right, though, on Instagram.
*  It's on her Instagram.
*  If you want to let me drop a bombshell on you, Joe.
*  Okay.
*  A bombshell?
*  No, no.
*  I've been a big fan of Sachsberg Cohen until I learned he spoke at the ADL last year and
*  called for my arrest for free speech and he called for Jeff Zuckerberg's arrest.
*  Mark Zuckerberg's arrest.
*  And for Mark Zuckerberg's arrest for free speech.
*  He wants to work in Hollywood.
*  You got to do what you got to do.
*  Let's go further.
*  I don't agree.
*  But I mean, he said arrest people for their free speech and he supports Internet censorship.
*  So how does he make his money being this avant-garde, cutting edge, really over the edge comic
*  that does things that could technically be seen as illegal?
*  I support his free speech.
*  And then he says, I don't deserve it.
*  Well, it's really dangerous.
*  He's flawed like many great artists.
*  Until they come for him, he's not going to understand the slippery slope of censorship.
*  And this is another thing that people have criticized me for being friends with you and
*  for talking to you.
*  And they also criticized me for not supporting a lot of these people that got banned and
*  deplatformed.
*  My take on it has always been the best way to counter wrong speech is correct speech.
*  When someone says something that's wrong, or someone says a conspiracy theory that's
*  not accurate, the best way to counter that is to do better speech, to have people say
*  the accurate information and to let the truth rise to the top.
*  When you start censoring people, the problem is it's a fucking slippery slope.
*  And there's a reason why we've been so steadfast in supporting the First Amendment in this
*  country.
*  And people think it doesn't apply to tech because these tech institutes are private
*  businesses and they should be able to do whatever they want with their private business.
*  The problem is that fucking slippery slope has gone from censoring you, from banning
*  Alex Jones off Twitter a year and a half ago, to getting the White House press secretary
*  banned off Twitter because she posted something from the New York Post, which is crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's a 200 and whatever year old newspaper.
*  America's oldest newspaper.
*  And what she said, the post, what they printed and put out there is accurate.
*  Well, let's go further.
*  Let's go further.
*  They're denying that it's a real story, but they don't ever say the emails are fake.
*  They just say it's a smear.
*  No, it's a real laptop.
*  The videos have been released.
*  It's confirmed.
*  But just think about this.
*  It is a smear in that they're putting it out there.
*  They're timing it.
*  Sure, but they're not denying it's real.
*  No, it's real.
*  It's real.
*  How did the laptop, how did this laptop become this big story?
*  That's where it gets tricky.
*  Yeah, I'm curious.
*  Because supposedly he dropped it off at a laptop repair shop in Delaware.
*  What an idiot.
*  I mean, who's doing that?
*  Well, Crackhead.
*  Right, right.
*  Good point.
*  The guy's smoking crack.
*  I keep forgetting he smokes crack.
*  Well, he did at the time.
*  Apparently he's kicked it.
*  So congratulations to him.
*  But the guy had some problems.
*  This is self-admitted.
*  And they have the receipts.
*  And here's the thing.
*  He calls him dozens of times.
*  Everybody knows when you bring a laptop or anything in, they say, if you don't pay for
*  this, we're going to wipe it and sell it.
*  And so three months goes by, six months goes by.
*  Nobody ever comes and gets it.
*  The guy goes to look at it at the repair shop, the owner, and there's all these 25,000 files,
*  what looks like underage girls and all the rest of this crazy stuff and him smoking crack
*  or God knows what.
*  He gives it to the FBI.
*  Ray does nothing.
*  The director hides it from Trump.
*  And so people, let's just say inside that had copies of that, they leak it to Rudolf
*  Giuliani, who then now has started to put it out.
*  So instead of facing up to it, they just say anyone promoting this, whether it's the House
*  or Senate committees that we're linking to it or the New York Post or the president's
*  press secretary, you're now banned, which again shows it's election meddling.
*  It's gatekeeping to cover this up.
*  But I'll tell you what else has come out now.
*  His daughter, Biden's daughters, reportedly, reportedly, and they've not denied it now,
*  this broke three days ago, left her diary in a house that she had rented.
*  And the diary talks about all the same stuff and everything.
*  What the fuck is wrong with this family?
*  Hold on.
*  When I was looking into this, the thing I keep seeing people say is that he lived in
*  California.
*  That is true.
*  That's what I keep reading.
*  But they fly back and forth to Delaware.
*  These are jet setters.
*  They fly to Ukraine.
*  Well, that also might make sense that that's why he didn't go back to Delaware to pick
*  up the laptop.
*  Because when you're cracked out in California, it's really hard to make the flight.
*  Right?
*  Tim is the only one here who's probably smoked crack.
*  Guys, the FBI confirms they have the laptop now.
*  I will confirm it's not an easy flight coming down off cocaine or crack.
*  Yeah.
*  Have you smoked crack?
*  No, I have free-based cocaine, which is close.
*  How close is it?
*  Not as close as where I ever went and made shady deals in the Ukraine.
*  Well, that's the other thing.
*  By the way, that's in the emails.
*  Finally, where it's like, yeah, I mean, 30 million, part of it goes to the big guy.
*  They're like, okay, we want to meet with your dad.
*  And there's photos of them meeting and playing golf.
*  So let me tell you, this is real.
*  The FBI has the files.
*  They admit it's real.
*  It's a big deal.
*  But it's a real problem to ban this stuff from Twitter.
*  Putin rejects Donald Trump's criticism of Biden family business.
*  Well, because it's Russia's bribing Hunter Biden.
*  3.5 million through Putin, through the Moscow mayor who he's friends with to get the
*  Trump administration to be friends with to Hunter Biden again.
*  Well, if I was Putin, I would deny it too.
*  Listen, Putin has got to love this.
*  If I was Putin sitting back watching these fucking people eat themselves alive and
*  destroy the First Amendment, destroy democracy, and I'm sure they have a hand in it.
*  I'm sure China has a hand in it.
*  I'm sure Iran has a hand in it.
*  This is what the intelligence communities have been telling us for a long time now,
*  is that it's not just one foreign company or foreign country that's trying to fuck
*  with our democracy.
*  It's multiple.
*  Yeah, the idea that the Russians have a monopoly on this.
*  I mean, if the Russians were an NFL football team, they'd be like the lower third.
*  The US and China are the top teams.
*  And we should say the United States does it too.
*  It's 100% confirmed.
*  The idea that Russians got Trump in is asinine because here's what happens.
*  Notice they tried to impeach Trump just nine months ago for stuff in Ukraine because
*  whatever they are worried about, they project.
*  Okay, so Trump doesn't have Russia connections.
*  Trump doesn't have those connections.
*  Trump doesn't have those outside connections.
*  You can't buy him.
*  He doesn't have lobbyists.
*  The problem is he then has family and people around him that basically become lobbyists
*  for themselves and Trump isn't really even aware of it.
*  And then that's going on.
*  And I mean, even junior aides now, you'll find out have people given the millions of
*  dollars just to say something to the president.
*  Is this standard shit?
*  Is this just how politics have always been done?
*  It's just now we're seeing it?
*  Well, it was standard, let's say 200 years ago that you'd go out for the wife or the
*  brother or somebody that works in the White House.
*  It got organized the last 100 years with lobbyists.
*  Trump literally cut the lobbyist off, but all it did was now make everyone around him
*  a lobbyist, even though they're not officially a lobbyist.
*  How did he cut the lobbyists off?
*  He just stopped meeting with them and stop and just said, I want briefings on what's
*  going on.
*  I'll decide.
*  So that's why he pissed official Washington off.
*  Not that he's even perfect, but that he actually became the president for making decisions
*  himself instead of having consortiums and lobbyists pay him for policy.
*  That's why he says Biden's raised more money than me.
*  Of course, I can call up all these companies.
*  They'll give me any money I want, but I got to do what they say.
*  But it would put him in a compromised position.
*  Yes, but I'm being honest about it.
*  The vacuum and the blind spot is that then everyone around him in his cabinet and everyone
*  that works there, even down to mid-level people, are now getting multimillion-dollar contracts
*  for companies like AT&T and stuff just to even mention something to the president.
*  Hold up.
*  Before you go any further, you said AT&T.
*  Has it been proven that it's AT&T, or are you just saying AT&T like companies?
*  Let's just say, I'm not saying AT&T is bad.
*  I think AT&T is overall a good company.
*  But is AT&T doing something bad?
*  No, I was mentioning that as a Fortune 500 company.
*  Okay, but it's not AT&T.
*  No, it's not AT&T.
*  So we shouldn't say that.
*  See, this is why you need someone that's like a fact checker right next to you.
*  Well, no.
*  Go ahead and slow down.
*  The media will say I'm wrong about that, but okay.
*  No, no, hold on.
*  His personal lawyer, the one that ended up going to jail, actually-
*  Michael Cohen.
*  Michael Cohen was getting money from AT&T.
*  Go ahead and pull it up.
*  I was just trying to give you a gestalt quick analysis.
*  I understand.
*  But I just want to, I've told you before, what you really need on your show is like a legit
*  journalist who's right next to you with a laptop going, Alex, hold on, hold on.
*  Just slow down.
*  But I think you're right about that because-
*  But you get so much right, but when you get something wrong, that's what people jump in.
*  But what you've got to understand is-
*  AT&T confirms it paid Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's company.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember that.
*  See, Joe, they're always saying that I'm making stuff up.
*  They're lying.
*  Right, right.
*  Now, every once in a while, my memory used to be photographic, but from everything I've
*  done, it's not as good as it used to be.
*  It moves really quick, okay?
*  So when I'm saying stuff, it's just data knowledge, okay?
*  And then I can like, okay, yeah, did I say that?
*  Yeah, it's real.
*  Check it out.
*  But I'm not trying to make stuff up.
*  99% of the time.
*  Here it is.
*  AT&T confirmed Tuesday evening that paid President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in
*  2017 for, in quotes, insights into understanding the new administration.
*  Insights.
*  I love that.
*  So how much they pay him?
*  200,000 bucks and four separate payments of 50 bucks in late 2017, early 2018.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, but he got paid, I think the number was 10 million total from an early 2017.
*  Yeah, but he got paid a total from a handful of companies.
*  And by the way, AT&T is-
*  You did it shady.
*  Look, Avenatti alleged that Essential Consultants, a shell company set up by Cohen before the
*  election to pay Stormy Daniels, was paid by several corporations, including AT&T.
*  At the time, AT&T was seeking government approval for its acquisition of Time Warner, CNN's
*  parent company.
*  It's a merger.
*  It's a dirty world.
*  Yeah, but I'm telling you, AT&T is a sweetheart compared to Google and Facebook and Twitter
*  and all these people.
*  So I wasn't attacking them.
*  I was giving the example of how everyone in his entourage becomes a lobbyist because he
*  thinks, I'll just cut lobbyist off.
*  He's not taking any money.
*  But then everyone around him becomes a lobbyist.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Do you worry about the influence of people like Jared Kushner have?
*  Because I know that a lot of biggest, his supporters, like Ann Coulter, who's Trump's
*  biggest supporter, goes, I don't love the idea that he hired his children and that they
*  have a lot of connections to-
*  I can tell you this.
*  I can tell you this.
*  People were really pissed who were patriots in the intelligence community and in other
*  areas, but also enemies of Trump that Kushner had so much influence.
*  But now Kushner's gotten a lot of respect because he's actually gotten a lot of huge
*  peace deals done that nobody else could do for 50 years.
*  That's interesting how little press those peace deals have gotten.
*  Yeah, they're getting none.
*  No press.
*  Yeah, it's really concerning.
*  So now, I mean, they were pissed like, who's this kid?
*  And now everything he touches turns to gold.
*  But he looks like the omen.
*  We've covered this multiple times.
*  He looks like a little devilish.
*  It looks like gaming.
*  He paid twice what it was worth for like 666 Park Avenue.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  That's not good.
*  That's not great.
*  Why would he want that?
*  Why would he want that?
*  I think it was more than twice.
*  Look up 666.
*  Is it Park Avenue?
*  Listen, maybe he's a Satanist.
*  He's getting good deals done in the Middle East.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's getting good deals.
*  They say the Antichrist gets good deals in the Middle East.
*  If you're going to be a Luciferian, at least make peace in the Middle East.
*  How about that?
*  Maybe Satan's the only one that can do that.
*  AT&T's a really good cell phone company.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Hey, hey, it's the way it works.
*  I mean, you want to when I mentioned AT&T.
*  It's an example that popped in my head of unofficial lobby.
*  Well, I was happy that we called you on it because then we found out it's correct.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, you've been correct about a lot of shit.
*  This is my point from jump.
*  I found out about agent provocateurs from you, from your nine eleven road to tyranny
*  video where they use them at the World Trade Organization protests in Seattle in the late
*  90s.
*  Like I had no idea that it was a common practice to send in masked people to start smashing
*  things during peaceful protests.
*  So then they could go away.
*  I can give you the straight dope on Antifa.
*  If you want to do that.
*  Go ahead.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Hold on a second.
*  Six, six, six Park Avenue Project have been a black hole of cash for years until a sovereign
*  wealth fund made a substantial investment for the property after Kushner was already
*  serving as Trump's top adviser in the White House.
*  Wow.
*  OK.
*  Might be a nice building.
*  What does it say?
*  The Kushner Company?
*  Is that what his company is called?
*  Yeah.
*  His dad went to prison.
*  The Kushner Company's 666 Park Avenue Project.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I think that's beautiful.
*  His dad went to prison for, I believe, setting up his brother with like a prostitute.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  That's they're a fun family, the Kushner.
*  Wait a minute.
*  Wait a minute.
*  The dad set up the brother with a with a prostitute, with a court.
*  OK.
*  We are we are step by step.
*  We're going to fact check everyone.
*  No, no.
*  This is well known.
*  I understand.
*  But we need to have this for the people like me and Alex.
*  Don't just spout off.
*  I have the facts.
*  I know you have the facts, but I want to make sure.
*  I don't know.
*  Chris Christie, Jared Kushner's father, committed one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes
*  I prosecuted.
*  Wow.
*  Wow.
*  We fact check all of this is crazy.
*  We make that bigger for my old eyes.
*  Look at this.
*  Where does it say?
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  A court of law.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.
*  I'm going to make sure I get this.

*  that this was going on before what she'd already alleged.
*  Okay, as part of the plot, Kushner hired a prostitute to lure Shoulder into having sex
*  in a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel room.
*  First of all, if you find yourself in a Bridgewater, New Jersey motel-
*  You're fucked.
*  Run.
*  As the hidden camera rolls, a tape of the encounter was then sent to Kushner's sister
*  and Shoulder's-
*  Look, I know the whole story.
*  Just trust us.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  We tried.
*  I just made a comment that you start thinking about who's running the-
*  You start thinking about these stories and then Hunter Biden's running around with underage
*  people on the laptop.
*  You start going, why does everyone work for a Ukrainian gas company?
*  Who are these people running the country?
*  It's a little strange.
*  Yeah, the West controlled Ukraine, so they just used that as the money laundering off.
*  It's not the Ukrainians running us.
*  They use it as that.
*  But let's expand on this, Joe.
*  What I'm getting at here is I didn't bring up AT&T.
*  They're a good company overall.
*  They're not the one censoring and stuff.
*  It's the big tech.
*  The reason I raised that was just the one that popped in my head, the first one.
*  It's massive what's going on.
*  I'm just being honest that Trump's tried to-
*  It's only a couple hundred grand.
*  I mean, as much as that sounds like a lot of money-
*  Yeah, but the bigger ones, like he's talking about Google.
*  Communist China.
*  Amazon.
*  Communist China's even bigger.
*  It's bigger than big tech.
*  It literally spends hundreds of billions of dollars buying us off.
*  It owns Hollywood.
*  It owns a lot of the big telecoms.
*  It owns the majority of our debt.
*  And I've got articles in the LA Times and New York Times I brought for you where they
*  say Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America.
*  He was our leader.
*  And then at the Davos Group, he said three years ago, I will destroy Trump.
*  I will work with Hollywood.
*  I've got all his quotes right here.
*  And Xi Jinping said, I want to overthrow American democracy.
*  I want to repudiate it.
*  I want to discredit it.
*  And Xi Jinping admits he admires Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
*  Okay, but isn't he doing that because-
*  That's crazy.
*  That seems crazy.
*  You can pull it up.
*  I understand.
*  I'll show you.
*  Step by step.
*  Isn't he doing that because of Trump's trade deals?
*  Like the trade deals that Trump wants to do with China are not nearly-
*  Well, they're not one-sided for him.
*  Here's what happened.
*  Special interests in the US went in and opened up China in the 70s when most of them didn't
*  have running water or electricity.
*  They're hardworking, smart folks.
*  But by one-sided trade deals where we have higher tariffs on them than they own us and
*  all the rest of it or vice versa, through those deals, they use the slave labor of China
*  to then take over manufacturing worldwide.
*  And so China is a client state of the globalist.
*  And so now the Washington Post, the LA Times, the New York Times, I brought you the articles
*  here, Dreams of Red Emperor, the Relentless Rise of Xi Jinping.
*  And it says in these articles, he must destroy American Western Christian values.
*  We love him and we accept China as our master.
*  I have the goddamn articles.
*  This is treason.
*  The freaking-
*  Who's saying that?
*  Right here.
*  Washington Post.
*  But who's saying that quote?
*  Who's that quote?
*  Here, I'll give them to you.
*  This is the Washington Post.
*  There's a huge article, LA Times.
*  I understand, but the quote that you just said about he must destroy-
*  Just like I said, AT&T gave money unofficially lobbying, he pulled it up.
*  I read the article.
*  I'm not giving you the exact-
*  I understand what you're saying.
*  But what I'm asking you is who you quoted someone, but who did you quote when you said that?
*  I'm quoting from when I read these again this morning before I came here, what I remember,
*  David Don Durie, Durley-
*  Oh, that guy.
*  And this Chinese lady that-
*  I think he's talking about the prevailing sentiment of what they feel they must do.
*  I understand, but when you quote somebody, it's best to have this.
*  I just said in these articles, well, look at the headline.
*  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him from weakened America.
*  I mean, Xi needs to destroy Trump.
*  The Chinese dictator needs to destroy our president.
*  So do you think that they're doing that because Trump wants to change the trade deals with
*  China?
*  You know what Trump said?
*  Trump didn't start a trade war.
*  He ended our surrender.
*  We surrendered for 40 years with China where they don't take our goods, but we take all
*  of theirs and they manipulate their currency, but we haven't manipulated ours, where we
*  have carbon taxes that Obama put in to shut down over half our coal plants that are clean
*  and our electricity prices went up where you could not run a factory here competitively
*  against China.
*  So when Joe Biden says, we're going to cut off all the fossil fuels, not just fracking.
*  If you did that, we wouldn't just go bankrupt.
*  We'd starve to death.
*  75% of our power comes from fossil fuels.
*  I understand.
*  Let's step by step again.
*  Are coal plants really clean?
*  100% clean.
*  How is that possible?
*  I'll tell you.
*  Please.
*  There's two different types of major power plants.
*  When he says clean coal, I roll my eyes every time when Trump's like clean coal, clean.
*  Well that's because the engine is so damn good.
*  Is it?
*  I'll tell you.
*  Please.
*  They had old fashioned coal plants.
*  China doesn't have one scrubber or filter on their coal power plants and China doesn't
*  have clean burning coal.
*  There's one place in the United States that has major deposits of coal that is such pure
*  carbon you don't even need scrubbers.
*  Nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and water.
*  Well they know we know water's not bad so they list carbon dioxide.
*  People think it's monoxide.
*  It's like in studies if you say the scientific name of water, most people in Penn and Teller
*  skits on the street will say, man, dihydrogen monoxide.
*  If you go out on the street, Joe Rogan, and ask 100 austenites, dihydrogen monoxide is
*  everywhere.
*  If you get too much of it, you can die, drowned.
*  And most people will say, I want to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
*  That's the scientific name of water.
*  Same thing if you do the scientific name of salt.
*  Sounds scary.
*  So hydrogen monoxide is the bad one.
*  Hydrogen dioxide is a good one.
*  That's the life cycle.
*  On earth there's light, there's water, there's oxygen, and there's carbon dioxide.
*  Those are the four things you've got to have for life.
*  And so they've gotten people convinced to say coal is dirty.
*  It puts out carbon dioxide and water vapor.
*  And so until about the 70s, we were still burning dirty coal full of mercury, all of
*  it.
*  They found huge deposits of clean burning coal out west.
*  Enough in Utah to run the whole world for over a thousand years.
*  Well, what's the difference between the coal?
*  Well, let me tell you.
*  One coal is so damn pure, and it's only in the United States in major deposits, that
*  basically you don't even need to put scrubbers on it.
*  But our scientists in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, because they realized that dirty coal
*  has mercury in it, has all these horrible toxins.
*  They put scrubbers on it.
*  This one you drive by a coal plant.
*  It's this big, huge buildings and wires and hoses and big, huge steel.
*  Looks like an alien spaceship.
*  That's because it's called distillates.
*  They know how to burn it and then take off all the chemicals, all the toxins and make
*  plastics and make chemicals and make pesticides and make everything else that comes out of
*  that and then out of the stack comes nothing but water.
*  They have sensors on it.
*  Nothing but water and carbon dioxide.
*  Totally clean, totally pure.
*  So that's what's going on.
*  So carbon monoxide is what everybody's worried about.
*  Carbon dioxide increasing in the environment has no negative effects?
*  Let's talk about it.
*  They've done ice core samples, okay?
*  All over the Antarctic and the Arctic.
*  They've done mud core samples in all over the world, but mainly in Siberia and Wales
*  for some reason.
*  Jamie, I hope you're Googling.
*  I haven't got some decent stuff to pull up, but he's better right now.
*  So what happens is they can go back 20,000, 100,000, 200,000 years at least in the ice
*  and they know that they've also done spectrometers into stone.
*  They can scan it until it was there.
*  Carbon dioxide was over 500 times stronger in the time of the T-Rex, okay, in the Jurassic
*  Age.
*  That's why plants grew so fast.
*  Things were so big.
*  There was a higher oxygen level.
*  Just like Mars lost its atmosphere.
*  It used to have an ocean.
*  They've now gone and proven.
*  It lost its atmosphere as a smaller planet couldn't hold it.
*  Truth is the Earth's losing its atmosphere.
*  So what's crazy is we come right along at this time, pump up all of this juice and all
*  this carbon that was produced on the surface with plants and animals that ran down and
*  cracks into the Earth.
*  We're now pumping out all that carbon saved from millions of years ago and actually terraforming
*  the planet, putting more carbon dioxide in that we actually need right at this time.
*  Like aliens figured this out or something.
*  But hold please.
*  Isn't carbon dioxide responsible for an increase in the temperature of the Earth?
*  But they said that we would have a seven increase.
*  They said that by 2013 all that LA would be flooded and New York would be flooded.
*  All that's lies.
*  Okay, but let's forget about what they said in the past.
*  What they're saying now is that carbon dioxide increase is responsible for an increase in
*  the temperature of the Earth.
*  Which we hope it does.
*  Because we hope it increases the temperature of the Earth?
*  The last Ice Age.
*  Hold on, but hold on.
*  The increase in the temperature of the Earth is responsible for the increase in hurricanes,
*  the frequency and the power of the hurricanes.
*  If you look up the spectrum in the last hundred years, hurricanes have gotten weaker.
*  That's all media hype.
*  But let me just tell you.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  Joe, Joe, Joe, I swear to God.
*  I swear to God I can prove all this to you.
*  This is so for your audience.
*  Are you a carbon dioxide salesman?
*  Listen, well they always say I'm getting money from oil companies.
*  I'm not.
*  But can I please tell you what's going on?
*  Yes, please do.
*  You are a carbon based life form.
*  Let me show you what I came here with in my notes.
*  I have right here in my notes the carbon conspiracy.
*  And that is specifically what I wanted to get into here with you in my notes.
*  Because this is everything.
*  Are you a climate change denier?
*  Well, see, imagine.
*  Imagine how that's how they use that term.
*  Are you a climate change denier?
*  It's like a 9-11 denier.
*  No, the towers got blown up.
*  Our government had prior warning.
*  And they've been funding Al Qaeda and all that came out later in Senate reports in the
*  28 pages.
*  Let's not go there just now because we're going to go down a rabbit hole.
*  That's true.
*  But let's go to carbon.
*  I agree with you there.
*  OK.
*  What is Joe Rogan made up out of?
*  Carbon.
*  Carbon based life form.
*  We are literally stardust.
*  It's a song, right?
*  Exactly.
*  What are trees made out of?
*  Tree stuff?
*  Carbon.
*  Carbon.
*  Yeah, carbon based life forms.
*  It's most of the things on the planet.
*  And so this is the carbon cycle.
*  This is in the mainline textbooks.
*  I understand.
*  So just like they come out in assault reality now and say a little boy is biologically a
*  girl.
*  I don't care if he grows up once he's a girl.
*  Again, rabbit hole.
*  Let's not go down these rabbit holes.
*  But I'm saying it's not science.
*  They go the science is settled.
*  There's not two genders.
*  Be fucking ass.
*  OK, hold on.
*  Let's not go down that road.
*  Do you want to go to that road in the future?
*  We will.
*  No, no, no.
*  I'll do it.
*  Let me tell you.
*  Right now, I want you to talk about carbon.
*  I don't want to get off track here because isn't there a delicate balance with the temperature
*  on Earth and the rising sea levels and the melting in the ice caps?
*  This has all been established by a lot of they say they say the science is settled.
*  But very concerned environmentalists have said that an increase in the temperature of
*  the Earth could be disastrous power grab civilization.
*  It's power grab.
*  Are you sure it's a power grab?
*  I am absolutely fricking literally.
*  But how do you how do you know that it's not all how do you know that because they're arrogant
*  and they've all written white papers on that I've read that could give you white papers?
*  Yeah, it's not what you see in the news.
*  They're called white papers.
*  And Joe, just like Joe.
*  This is why people get banned from the Internet.
*  These kind of conversations.
*  We better ban it right now.
*  Let's not ban it.
*  I'm just not.
*  I'll throw that out.
*  Let's just not certainly not ban the YouTube page.
*  Let me tell you the story.
*  Fantastic, by the way.
*  What your YouTube page?
*  Thank you.
*  Let me tell you this right now.
*  It'll be up for another 24 hours.
*  They have called in the European Union for the arrest of scientists that question the
*  cause of anthropogenic warming or if it's manmade.
*  OK, but there is a contributing factor.
*  Scientifically it's been proven that increased carbon dioxide has an effect on the temperature
*  of the earth.
*  You agree with that?
*  It depends on the models they use.
*  Sometimes actually more carbon dioxide can cause a cooling effect, but generally could
*  cause a heating effect.
*  It depends on potash, the atmosphere, volcanic ejections at the time, and also solar maximum
*  and minimums.
*  If you have sunspot activity is the main generator of planetary climate.
*  But the wide, if you had a giant swath of scientists that are examining carbon dioxide
*  in the atmosphere, would you agree that the majority of them believe that it's a contributing
*  factor to warming of the earth?
*  Joe, it's a mantra where they say the majority of scientists agree that climate change has
*  caused by humans.
*  I agree with climate change.
*  The only thing that's constant is change.
*  Of course the climate is changing.
*  What I'm telling you is carbon dioxide was 50 to 500 times, depending on the time period,
*  higher millions of years ago than it is now.
*  But you also realize that that was before we got hit by an asteroid.
*  What do you think the motivation is for them to present the evidence in this way?
*  Like you said, this is a fraud and everything.
*  Because I've heard you talk about this before.
*  What do you think their goal is by linking all of this climate change to manmade activity?
*  What's the goal?
*  The goal is a centralized world government that can then monitor all carbon and control
*  it as a toxic bad thing.
*  That didn't work so now it's, oh, you have a cold, you're dirty with COVID, we've got
*  to track you and tax you and control you.
*  So the new thing is COVID to cut the carbon footprint.
*  Before we go down the COVID rabbit hole, the environmentalists are not in bed with the
*  industrialists.
*  The environmentalists are not in bed with all these people that think that they can
*  control the world.
*  Actually BP and ExxonMobil are the biggest funders of the climate change movement.
*  They're the biggest funders of it.
*  Contrary to what you hear.
*  How so?
*  All right, Joe, here's the thing.
*  I understand this is, and you're a smart guy, and I understand you want to go over each
*  piece of this.
*  Let's go through.
*  Well, we have to.
*  We have to.
*  I agree.
*  Let's go through each piece.
*  But understand, you understand that the way you talk, and I enjoy the way you talk.
*  It's fast.
*  But the way you talk is fast and you go on these long tangents and then you go to frogs
*  being gay and a lot of things happen.
*  I want to do it.
*  And people can tell.
*  I'm putting a record out.
*  Yes, but I want to do it step by step.
*  All right, let's do this.
*  Let's do this.
*  Most people, the vast majority, here we got here, BP commits $100 million to fund new
*  emissions reductions projects.
*  But let me just go back for a second.
*  I appreciate you backing me up.
*  Yes.
*  Let me break down.
*  Are frogs gay?
*  You want to get to the frog stuff now?
*  Connect it all.
*  That is by the way.
*  Why do I feel like I'm stoned and I haven't smoked my pot?
*  Yeah, I wish.
*  If he's not going to smoke it, I'm going to smoke it.
*  Oh, God, it's sober October.
*  Break the goddamn rule and then go an extra day.
*  I cannot.
*  I cannot.
*  I'm like George Washington.
*  Well, on election night, we're going to get hammered, right?
*  Election night.
*  I'm getting hammered.
*  But you're going to pop in.
*  You can pop in.
*  But we've told everybody now that we're doing a live election night show.
*  Kyle Kalinsky, Tim Dillon, me, Al Shones going to pop in live.
*  It's going to be fun.
*  It's live.
*  So while you're watching the world burn.
*  Yeah.
*  All right, Joe, here's the thing.
*  It's just like I don't explain to you because I love you.
*  And dude, it's just like when you said, what's the AT&T deal?
*  And I went, oh, look it up.
*  But listen, we did look it up and we found this information.
*  This is bigger.
*  OK, let me let me get my brain focused here for a minute.
*  Let me just try to explain.
*  I've literally interviewed probably, it's not exaggerate, 200 top scientists from petroleum geologist, astrophysicist to astronauts to quantum mechanics to petroleum.
*  Buckle up because I have to.
*  I know.
*  Moron.
*  I know.
*  OK, you're a moron.
*  Yeah, they're not.
*  Trust me.
*  Joe, you're a smart guy.
*  And I'm at his cover.
*  He is smart.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  I'm a smart moron.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  OK, let me tell you what's going on.
*  I'm going to say it again.
*  You can go to any major study.
*  Just type in carbon dioxide levels were hundreds of times higher in Earth's early past.
*  Well, I understand that.
*  But also, I understand.
*  You can look at the ocean models then.
*  Yes.
*  You can look at the ocean models.
*  Right.
*  And it's true.
*  The oceans didn't cover more than they do now.
*  Jones, human beings weren't alive 65 million years ago and the environment wasn't compatible
*  for us.
*  We put out a fraction.
*  We hadn't developed yet.
*  Well, we were moles.
*  We had shrews.
*  Shrews, yeah.
*  But my point is, you're right.
*  Is that.
*  Last time CO2 was this high, humans didn't exist.
*  Last time there was this much carbon dioxide, CO2 in the Earth.
*  CO2 levels are far higher now than they have been for any time during the past.
*  And oil, a single CO2 milk, who can remain in the atmosphere.
*  What did you do?
*  Oh, I see.
*  I understand.
*  OK.
*  OK.
*  So, let's just go to what this says.
*  And what is this paper that's.
*  Is this climatecentral.org?
*  OK.
*  The last time there was this much carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans
*  didn't exist.
*  We had bigotoo sharks, proud of the oceans, blah, blah, blah.
*  All right.
*  As we near the record for the highest CO2 concentrations in human history, 400 parts
*  per million, climate scientists worry about what, where, about, excuse me, about where
*  we were then and where we're rapidly headed now.
*  According to the data gathered by Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, dope spot, the 400
*  ppm mark may briefly be exceeded this month when CO2 typically hits a seasonal peak.
*  Sure.
*  And I've had top scientists on, I've had climatologists on about the Keeling curve.
*  I can tell you all this.
*  Here's the threshold according to Ralph Keeling, the researcher.
*  Carbon dioxide is the most important long-lived global warming gas.
*  And once it's emitted by burning fossil fuels.
*  It helps us keep our atmosphere.
*  Hold please.
*  Hold please.
*  Once it's emitted by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil, a single CO2 molecule
*  can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
*  Global CO2 emissions reached a record high of 35.6 billion tons in 2002, excuse me, in
*  2012, up 2.6% from 2011.
*  Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases warm the planet by absorbing the sun's energy
*  and preventing heat from escaping back into space, which means it enhances the atmosphere.
*  But the sea levels didn't go up like they said.
*  So aren't they melting?
*  But it's a process.
*  Al Gore said by 2013.
*  Al Gore.
*  Joe, listen, this is one guy's take.
*  I know, but Al Gore's out there flying around.
*  I know, I know.
*  You found a guy admitting that it used to be higher than it is now.
*  I'm telling you, it used to be way higher than it is now.
*  Right, but then the asteroid hit the Yucatan, killed all the dinosaurs and changed the entire
*  atmosphere of the planet.
*  I don't want to, with a dark winter.
*  Yeah, it was very bad for everything.
*  Caused by atmospheric dust.
*  For a long fucking time.
*  One major volcano like Mount St. Helens, they estimated, put out more dust than decades
*  of human dust.
*  And human dust is what helps cause nucleotide form to cause storms.
*  So we are affecting our environment.
*  But most of the astrophysicists and most of the physicists I've talked to, most of the
*  climatologists I've talked to, they have broken down that the sun by magnitude is 98% of the
*  driver of what happens.
*  That's why when the sunspots take place, it's an eronal ejection.
*  From the sun.
*  And one of those shoots radiation in our direction.
*  It'll be clear blue sky.
*  But they know when we get hit by that, it hits our magnetic field and causes an ionization
*  of the atmosphere and electrification of it.
*  And so that causes the giant storms.
*  So the main driver of climate is the sun.
*  And I think everybody, doesn't it be a scientist to know what's the main thing that Earth living
*  off of?
*  The sun, the sun.
*  And so they're telling us that carbon dioxide does this.
*  What happens is, is carbon dioxide goes up.
*  They said can be in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.
*  It's normally absorbed by plants immediately who they've got studies.
*  They have found giant crocodile skeletons from just 10,000 years ago in the central
*  Sahara, when hundreds of square miles is nothing but dunes.
*  10,000 years ago it was lush jungles and beautiful, but they had goats and they ate all of the
*  plants and killed birds.
*  Well, there's also the Younger Dryas theory of asteroid impacts that ended the ice age.
*  12,000 years ago.
*  Yeah, 10, well two impacts.
*  I believe there's 12 and then somewhere between the 11 and 12.
*  But the answer is we don't know.
*  And so they've now looked at all these big models saying that it's all carbon dioxide
*  and it's not.
*  It's the sun, it's asteroids, it's tectonic, it's electromagnetic from the Earth's core.
*  I understand all this, but isn't CO2 emissions the one thing that we can control?
*  So human created global warming gases like CO2 emissions.
*  If we can put a cap on that, wouldn't you agree?
*  Let me ask you a question.
*  But if we continue to put that stuff in the atmosphere and it continues to get higher
*  and higher and higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, wouldn't that?
*  It's going to make, the studies show, it's going to make deserts become green again and
*  plants are going to absorb the carbon.
*  What studies are these?
*  You can look them up.
*  Okay, let's find out.
*  And that's why the left even says.
*  But if you're going to say something like that, and I'm not arguing with you, but if
*  you are going to say something like that, that's a very bold thing to say, you should
*  probably not just say look them up.
*  There should be something.
*  Let's type it in.
*  Let's type it in.
*  There's hundreds of them.
*  I actually brought like over 50 articles right here.
*  Do you have something that you've read that makes you so confident that you can say this?
*  I actually know what the plant studies show, where in greenhouses they grow plants with
*  higher carbon dioxide.
*  And plants can grow up to three times faster.
*  They live longer.
*  Of course.
*  Plants live off carbon dioxide.
*  And what do they put out more?
*  Oxygen.
*  Well, this one thing that has been proven is that there's more plants now than there
*  have been in a long fucking time.
*  There's a global greening happening, countering us losing our atmosphere up until this point.
*  The earth has less atmosphere than it did a million years ago.
*  And it's like God did this or something where we discovered all this oil, which is blind
*  luck that we are terraforming the planet back to an earlier, healthier state by taking ancient
*  carbon that was under the ground and putting it back into the atmosphere.
*  But isn't the problem that along the way we're also increasing the temperature of the planet
*  and we are not aligned with a higher temperature?
*  You can.
*  Here's the truth.
*  We don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  But in 1963, the Club of Rome came up with a limits to growth plan and they had models
*  and actuaries.
*  And I have copies of this in my film, Endgame, seminal film.
*  It's free online.
*  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement predicts a virus release to lock things down.
*  Everything's not happening because it's in their own documents.
*  And in the 1963 Limits to Growth Club of Rome plan, they said, we believe there'll be a
*  global ice age by 2020 because the last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago and we're
*  set for that.
*  We're going to tell the public that actually carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is bouncing
*  solar radiation off the earth because we've seen volcanoes cause this darkening effect
*  and freezing.
*  So we believe, our scientists believe, that carbon dioxide is going to make the earth
*  freeze by 2020.
*  And so we've got to have a global regime to take control of all the factories and all
*  the energy and put a tax in for global government in the name of stopping the ice age.
*  Then by about 1987, they went, actually, we think it's going to heat up instead.
*  So they flipped the propaganda.
*  Ask anybody you know.
*  Okay.
*  But don't you understand that science back then didn't have as much data as they have
*  now.
*  And what they had predicted in 1963 is faulty compared to the information they have in 2020.
*  Just like Foushee said 2.5 million would be dead from COVID.
*  It was 200,000.
*  But worldwide, what is it?
*  Worldwide tuberculosis killed 20 million people, 1.4 million here last year, but nobody cares.
*  COVID killed a lot of people worldwide.
*  COVID has not even killed a million worldwide.
*  What?
*  Not even a million worldwide.
*  No, is that true?
*  Yep.
*  Come on.
*  Yep.
*  Oh, we use UN models.
*  Again, they're our boss.
*  Since when did the WHO say the lockdown has to go on?
*  Now they go, oh, we're against the lockdown.
*  Your nation states that it's their fault because they know millions are starving to death from the lockdown.
*  That is true and very underreported.
*  The WHO has now come out against lockdown saying that the reaction can't be a worse effect than the actual disease itself.
*  So let me back Alex up with the climate changes.
*  There's certainly, you know, we are contributing to manmade global warming.
*  But also, what are you going to do?
*  What are we going to do?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, that's the other question.
*  What are we going to do?
*  Why does his mic sound weird?
*  Is it hot?
*  Is he on it?
*  Or is it how I'm hearing it?
*  I'm hearing like a breakup of his mic.
*  Sounds good to me.
*  Sounds fine to me.
*  That's weird.
*  Okay.
*  I'm sorry.
*  It must be me.
*  Jamie's really low.
*  You sound great.
*  He sounds good.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So we're talking about the idea of using climate to contribute because as you said with COVID and we talked about this, we give up a lot of rights, right?
*  In the name of coronavirus.
*  Exactly.
*  What it looks like, there's real issues.
*  We don't really know what's going on.
*  They want to be able to track all carbon and tax it with an AI surveillance grid with a social credit score over it.
*  Yeah.
*  And they admit all of that.
*  Joe, they tell us.
*  Okay.
*  I understand that.
*  I understand that the environmentalists who are concerned are not, there's a giant amount of them that are legitimately concerned that we're ruining the earth.
*  Yes, I understand the greenhouse effect.
*  The fossil fuels.
*  I understand the greenhouse effect.
*  But these people, the reason why they're acting, the reason why they're trying to get people on electric cars and trying to get people off fossil fuels, hold up please.
*  They're legitimately concerned.
*  Like I don't believe that these actual environmentalists are going on something.
*  Sure, I agree with you.
*  But I mean, here's the deal.
*  The new Hummer looks badass.
*  Here's the deal.
*  Here's the deal.
*  But I'm not getting one because I don't want to contribute to global warming.
*  You don't want to contribute to global warming?
*  Listen, be serious.
*  Did you know, did you know that on average more carbon is spent for electricity into a car than 93 octane gasoline?
*  Well, I would believe that because I would think it takes a lot to make a fucking electric car.
*  But once the car is made.
*  No, no, no.
*  No, no, no.
*  You lose up to half of transmission and most of it's coal powered, brother.
*  So most of the electricity.
*  Per megawatt, it's more.
*  So when I'm plugging my Tesla in and I think, because that's how I like to think, I'm a good guy.
*  I'm plugging my Tesla in.
*  I'm helping save the world.
*  I'm not because I'm contributing to power.
*  No, you're driving, you're contributing to putting carbon dioxide back in and oxygen and re-terraforming the planet.
*  You're doing a badass job.
*  The biggest energy guzzlers.
*  Electric cars are bad ass.
*  They are putting out more carbon than anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't come out the tailpipe.
*  They come out the power plant top.
*  But what about electric cars?
*  Carbon?
*  Yeah.
*  Team Carbon.
*  Carbon.
*  How do you feel about carbon?
*  OK. How do you feel about nuclear power?
*  I absolutely hate it.
*  Why do you hate it?
*  Isn't it clean?
*  Oh, 94.
*  I'm not trying to tear you up.
*  Don't tear me up.
*  I don't know anything.
*  I told you I'm a moron.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I used to be for nuclear power.
*  Oh, what happened?
*  I actually did research.
*  What research did you do?
*  They're always saying it's totally clean, no problem.
*  But then you can look at the UN zone numbers, which I believe, International Atomic Energy Agency.
*  Look this up, CBS News.
*  94% of nuclear plants are leaking at dangerous levels.
*  Look this up.
*  Pause.
*  Jamie, 94% of nuclear power plants are leaking at dangerous levels.
*  Isn't the problem that we're using old tech?
*  Yeah, see, you're smart.
*  You always know everything, Joe.
*  The average power plant age is 36 years.
*  Almost all these power plants are, life is 20 to 35 years.
*  Fukushima was already a decade older than it was supposed to be a general electric model using plutonium.
*  Radioactive leaks found at 75% of US nukesites.
*  Yeah, it's worse than that.
*  It's 94%.
*  OK, well, that's not good.
*  I don't know why 94 doesn't pop up at something you report.
*  But wouldn't it be possible with innovation that they currently have access to?
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  You talk about corrupt companies.
*  Listen, if people actually ran these right, and the executives, here's an example, BP.
*  I think oil is great, it has toxic problems.
*  We should clean it up.
*  We should find alternatives.
*  There's all sorts of clean energy we should go to that isn't.
*  Solar is great, whatever.
*  They've got fission, fusion, a bunch of stuff coming down.
*  Take one of the best films out there because it's so accurate.
*  Because I had lawyers on from the, I read the transcript of the trial, the event horizon with BP.
*  They literally have all these degree engineers out there, and BP calls them up from England to Houston and says,
*  you're spending $25 million a day on this super deep experimental well.
*  We've decided to not pour concrete, they call it mud, in on top of this.
*  The executives say, we'll save $25 million a day if you dump water.
*  And all the engineers went, we have mathematical equations, just like water boils at a certain amount.
*  Okay, or we have a certain number of chromosomes.
*  This is fact.
*  And they, on record, go, you're fired if you don't, order them to dump water into it.
*  So they follow the order, dump water in for five days, and it blows up.
*  Because water didn't have enough pressure to hold what was going to be coming out when they finally hit that giant oil and gas deposit
*  down there at 20,000 feet under the ground or whatever it was.
*  Super deep well, it was deeper than that.
*  So you watch that movie with Kirk Russell and the rest of it and Marky Mark.
*  Wasn't Event Horizon the one where they find...
*  I'm sorry, Event Horizon is where they go...
*  Event Horizon is a spaceship.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm sorry.
*  I'm trying to remember oil in Event Horizon.
*  I'm like, wait a minute, what?
*  Lawrence Fishburne, right?
*  Yeah, I think.
*  They go to hell.
*  Here's my brain.
*  Deepwater Horizon.
*  Pull up Event Horizon, because that's a great fucking movie.
*  I love that movie.
*  It's like they go into hell, they go into new dimension.
*  Also about BP.
*  But see how my brain got that wrong?
*  It was not on purpose.
*  No, it's okay.
*  That's the shit.
*  He pulls his eyeballs out and tells everybody.
*  Yeah, remember that?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great fucking movie.
*  Pure evil.
*  Listen, I'm not trying to rant here.
*  What I'm telling you Joe is it's the same thing with nuclear power plants.
*  Why would the executives at BP order their engineers to do something that was going to blow up?
*  They just said, you engineers are full of crap.
*  We're going to make money.
*  Do you think they might just be arrogant engineers on Adderall and they made a big mistake?
*  Well, no, no.
*  Yeah, that's what happened.
*  Could be.
*  That's what happened.
*  That is what happened?
*  Well, those guys are probably tweaked out, right?
*  Those executives.
*  What I'm saying, it wasn't engineers.
*  It was the executives.
*  Yeah, but executives.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Why do you think they were like, keep pouring water in it, keep pouring water in it?
*  Because they were insane.
*  Right.
*  I mean, that's what I'm saying about these nuclear.
*  So the engineers are at the mercy of these executives who don't have the degrees the
*  engineers have and they made a crucial error and they forced the engineers to do something
*  that was ultimately dangerous.
*  And so I was agreeing with you about we should listen to scientists and engineers.
*  I was just going back to your point that, yeah, we don't know about the warming.
*  We don't know what it's doing.
*  The models they all use on warming factor out the sun.
*  Right.
*  And you can't factor out the sun in an equation.
*  I've had other scientists that factor the sun in and they think, despite all we're doing,
*  that within the next 200 years we're going to a very serious deep eye stage.
*  I think Alex's point is that in all of these things, there are legitimate things.
*  COVID has there are real things people getting sick, global warming, to an extent, I'm sure,
*  is happening.
*  Of course it's happening.
*  But then there are also nefarious characters that want to use that to take away your freedom.
*  There are people that don't want you owning a car.
*  There's all these legacy systems.
*  Whitney Webb, as a journalist who came on my show, said a lot of people didn't want
*  to reopen the economy until they remade the economy and got rid of all these legacy systems.
*  And this is a doc with Eric Schmidt, who was the head of Google, and you can look it up.
*  And they were saying, you know, they were considering these legacy systems like cash,
*  private ownership of cars, you know, things like that, like getting rid of all of these things
*  that are distinctly American ways of life and just saying that like, we don't want you to own a car.
*  This is the most important thing that's been said here today.
*  That's why I'm here.
*  One step at a time, though.
*  Why would they want to get rid of private ownership of cars?
*  Because they want control of people.
*  And if you allow them to drive their own cars and use cash and run their own businesses and live in their own homes.
*  But let's start with cars.
*  Vertical integration.
*  Let's start with cars.
*  Don't you think that maybe the concern is they're looking at the future of autonomous vehicles,
*  which would drastically lower the mortality rate on highways.
*  And they're saying, I mean, are they concerned?
*  Are the people that run this country, Joe, concerned with the mortality rate?
*  I mean, they're bombing other countries to do this.
*  Stop, stop, stop.
*  They want centralized control.
*  Hold please.
*  Steve Wozniak, the former founder of Apple, says the best AIs on the planet.
*  Hold this thought.
*  Hold this thought.
*  Yeah.
*  But hold this thought.
*  The mortality rate on highways?
*  Listen, you can't think that the people.
*  These people are in the woods with hoods on.
*  But the people at Google that are working on autonomous vehicles, they're not the same people that are trying to control governments all outside the world.
*  But it's controlled by those guys.
*  All of those people at Google want to usher in a brave new world.
*  They want to remake the world in the way that they want to.
*  But you're saying all these people, some of them are just writing software to make a better picture.
*  Some of them are.
*  Joe, Joe, I wrote.
*  But there's a lot of them that are not, Joe.
*  Joe, I wrote notes.
*  I feel like I'm the fucking voice of reason.
*  How is this possible?
*  Joe, you know why?
*  They're the tech utopians.
*  I'm not high.
*  I should be high.
*  I'd be right along with you.
*  Yeah, you're very combative.
*  Joe?
*  These are utopians.
*  They want to create a paradise on Earth.
*  Joe, I brought you.
*  Through control.
*  I brought you the documents, Joe.
*  I'm sucking on this cigar.
*  Joe, we have the documents.
*  I'm sucking on this cigar like it's a jelly donut.
*  I'm hoping I can get to the weed on the inside.
*  Hey, Joe.
*  I'm like, I'm licking the outside.
*  What do you got there?
*  A piece of paper?
*  Take it.
*  What does it say?
*  What does it say?
*  What does it say?
*  I think it's confirming what I just said.
*  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
*  What is this?
*  See?
*  Okay, but it's a person who wrote this.
*  It's Adam Kirsch.
*  He's probably got a pistol in his mouth right now.
*  No, that's the Wall Street Journal cover story.
*  I don't really mean that, Adam.
*  I apologize.
*  That's the Wall Street Journal cover story.
*  May I please tell you what I came here for?
*  You came here for a reason?
*  Yes.
*  Hold on.
*  Here it is.
*  COVID-19 has spotlighted the world's most powerful, most powerful, most powerful, most
*  You came here for a reason?
*  Yes.
*  Hold on.
*  Here it is.
*  COVID-19 has spotlighted the promise and peril of transhumanism, the idea of using
*  technology to overcome sickness, aging, and death.
*  Okay, but what is he saying?
*  I used to fall asleep every night listening to Alex talk about this, so I want to let
*  Alex talk about this.
*  Until they took him off YouTube.
*  Okay, but make this look.
*  He was the way I fell asleep every night.
*  Listen, not only did they do that, but do you know they fucking took a Young Turks podcast,
*  Young Turks podcast yesterday off of Facebook?
*  They took it off.
*  Talk about that in a minute.
*  Can we get some weed out of you?
*  Progressive.
*  Yeah, we can get some.
*  We got some on the outside.
*  No, you need it.
*  No, I can't.
*  I'll blow it at you like you got a cat high.
*  Cat, cat.
*  Does that not cheat if I blow it in your face?
*  I can't do it.
*  I'll blow it in your face.
*  I can't do it.
*  Listen, I'm getting kind of high from this cigar.
*  Well, listen, I need to talk to you.
*  I'm a little lightheaded.
*  All right, I'm going to go get some apple juice and I'm going to pray to Jesus.
*  We got some in here.
*  Listen, listen, I need to talk to you.
*  Just go grab some bottles and some ice.
*  Get him some apple juice for the transhumanism discussion, please.
*  Listen, listen, you wonder why I'm so crazy?
*  No.
*  Because I discovered this stuff right out of mainline documents and I've known it for
*  26 years, 27 years.
*  Well, here's another thing.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  I, like, we all know that you've fucked some things up, right?
*  And your biggest fuck up is Sandy Hook.
*  But you've gotten so many things right.
*  And this is why I keep talking to you about these things and why I defend you and why
*  I think that it's fucking dangerous to censor you and to say, oh, this guy, we need to get
*  him deep platform to get him.
*  You're revealing some things that have been proven on the show so far to be true that
*  make people very uncomfortable.
*  Well, the first thing I was going to do was thank you for having me on and have the courage.
*  But I was going to say the fucking Bohemian Grove thing, the Bohemian Grove thing.
*  That was a mate.
*  That was the first time I really got into what he was doing.
*  And that was like amazing.
*  I mean, when you watch that movie, watch that, you know, it's it's paradigm shift.
*  I've had people try to minimize that.
*  I've had people.
*  Yes, they all do.
*  I go, listen to me.
*  I'm not a billionaire.
*  I'll give you the real take on it because I've been there and I think it's just a gateway
*  to things.
*  But let's get into Bohemian Grove in a moment.
*  I really want to give you I want to give you the big enchilada.
*  The big enchilada.
*  OK.
*  Yeah.
*  Just like a mole sauce.
*  Yes, sir.
*  Just like I love mole sauce.
*  I do, too.
*  The engineers and meanwhile, a lot of them have good points.
*  I'm not saying they're wrong about all this stuff.
*  I'm simply telling you, I've read what the globalists have to say in their own establishment
*  communication.
*  OK.
*  And I have it right here in my notes to talk to you about the post human era and the system
*  that they are setting up, where in all of their main publications, they say humans are flawed,
*  humans are bad.
*  But they are.
*  But they are flawed.
*  Right.
*  But then these corporations are saying they're going to take us out of our bodies and make
*  a silicon.
*  And that's what Elon Musk talks about.
*  Beware those that worship AI gods.
*  Well, he's actually talking about Neuralink, which is something where they're going to
*  be able to interface with your brain and increase the bandwidth in which you access information.
*  But go ahead.
*  Well, that's it.
*  And so it seems inevitable, doesn't it?
*  No, it's not inevitable.
*  Already driverless cars don't know a wreck up ahead or what to do.
*  They have more accidents.
*  Steve Wozniak, as I was saying earlier, the founder of co-founder of Apple says the best
*  AI isn't a million percent close to how good an ant's brain is.
*  Right.
*  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
*  When they first developed cars, they said, well, how are you going to take them?
*  There's no roads.
*  Sure.
*  AI powered.
*  They built roads.
*  But do you understand that the AI that's powering these cars now is not as good?
*  You understand the people running the AI are predatory anti-humans that say they want to
*  get rid of us.
*  Elon Musk is not a predatory anti-human.
*  No, I didn't say he was.
*  But I understand.
*  He's working on autonomous vehicles.
*  He said, beware those that speak of AI gods.
*  Yes.
*  A lot of people are worried that Elon is more concerned.
*  Don't give me one of those.
*  You keep that shit away from me, motherfucker.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  He doesn't drink.
*  Thank you.
*  He's sober.
*  Look at all this extra fucking- I'm sitting next to Alex Jones.
*  I'm as high as I can be.
*  Election night.
*  Okay, but listen, listen, election night, we're going to get lit.
*  But these guys who are making this- Fucking Hollywood, this is fake.
*  This is only corn syrup coloring.
*  Do you think this is a good idea, though?
*  This idea that we should be expanding our minds in this way and putting chips in our-
*  Don't think it's good or bad.
*  I think it is the nature of human innovation.
*  I think we take things, we improve upon them.
*  We do that with everything.
*  But at what point do you cross a line?
*  Joe, you're talking about-
*  One point, Joe, can I please tell you?
*  Please, no, one at a time.
*  At one point in time, there was-
*  It is weed.
*  There was-
*  They had Morse code, right?
*  Yes.
*  They went from Morse code to you being able to send me a FaceTime video.
*  Understood.
*  Well, these things happen.
*  Hey, Joe, we're not against technology.
*  This is just part of being human.
*  We're not against technology.
*  May I please say something?
*  We're not against technology, but what I'm saying is if you follow technological innovation,
*  it becomes better and better and more and more invasive.
*  We need to design it where it doesn't make us obsolete.
*  Humans take control of their environment.
*  We build our environment.
*  The globalists have decided to have a post-human future where humans are no longer relevant.
*  This is where you lose me.
*  I can show you their damn clothes.
*  I am globalist.
*  But he's getting me because I-
*  I just gave you an article where they said it.
*  He's losing you.
*  He's getting me because I think he's right.
*  I think the only reason we're still around is because they haven't figured out how to
*  get robots good enough to get rid of all of it.
*  If they had the right robots, there would be no Walmart to get rid of everybody.
*  You don't think that?
*  If they were the right robots, they'd get rid of-
*  They're making us obsolete.
*  They're making us obsolete.
*  They're trying to get rid of the-
*  They need a fucking cooler.
*  I like to go to Walmart.
*  Is that okay?
*  Not, but once you have a robot, you won't want to go to Walmart.
*  Why?
*  Because it's dirty.
*  It's filthy.
*  No.
*  I listen to music.
*  That's why they're doing the COVID is to post human-
*  You're not essential under COVID.
*  Listen, they want to train you.
*  Okay, listen, look how calculators were great.
*  No one knows how to do math now.
*  Look how phones are great.
*  No one knows their numbers anymore.
*  All the statistics show that the science of technology is making us dumb.
*  And that's why they wrote the big article, the co-owner of Sun Microsystems.
*  In 2000, Bill Joy wrote, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
*  And he explains he went to a top billionaire tech conference and they made the decision
*  to not let humans sit around and play video games in the future.
*  That they were just going to slowly phase us out and kill everybody.
*  Stop.
*  They're not trying to kill-
*  Okay, pull up Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
*  But why wouldn't they?
*  But why wouldn't they?
*  Can we reverse engineer the question?
*  Because we're called useless eaters.
*  I don't think they're trying to kill people.
*  I think they're trying to improve what a person is.
*  What I think we're doing-
*  Oh, by chopping our son's balls off?
*  Okay, you're going to go down another rabbit hole, you son of a bitch.
*  By increasing our ability to access information and by becoming sort of a symbiotic creature
*  aligned with technology-
*  And once we're aligned with AI, it can censor everything we do.
*  You think the minute Big Tech got control, they began censoring.
*  And it's the groups behind that are very predatory, Joe.
*  I do agree with you there.
*  There's no firewalls.
*  I do.
*  Here's the problem.
*  The First Amendment currently does not apply to Big Tech.
*  I believe it should.
*  No, they're violating cartel laws.
*  They're organized.
*  I believe that what's happening now with, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or YouTube,
*  these platforms are so big, I think the argument can be made that they are utilities and that
*  they should be regulated like utilities.
*  It should be a human right.
*  I agree.
*  We did not have access to these things.
*  We did not talk about what we're going to cover pre to this, dude.
*  We're going to talk about a lot of things.
*  I'm going to read this.
*  This is what I wrote last night.
*  You ready?
*  The Silicon Cult.
*  I want some weed for you.
*  I want you to take it down a notch.
*  The Silicon Cult.
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  Is this another article?
*  No, I wrote this.
*  Oh, you wrote it.
*  These are talking points.
*  The Silicon Cult, defying the enemy, the war on carbon, announce up front that I am not
*  really a liberal or conservative.
*  I want a pro-human future.
*  Please listen to me and hear me out.
*  Let's stop right there because you get called a neoconservative.
*  You get called an alt-right.
*  You get called a far-right person.
*  When I first met you, you were protesting against George W. Bush and you were saying
*  that what he was doing and what he was trying to usher in was essentially going to be the
*  downfall of Western civilization.
*  Even before he was elected?
*  Yes, I remember that.
*  When people say Alex Jones is a far-right guy, I'm like, he's complicated.
*  He's really against corruption more than he's against any particular party.
*  You just found that the right was less apt to censor you and more apt to listen to your
*  ideas.
*  Exactly.
*  Not stone today.
*  I'd like to.
*  We're being a little aggressive, but here's the deal.
*  Election night, if I'm gracious enough to be here, or if you're gracious enough, I'll
*  be here, we'll get hammered.
*  Listen, let's get into Bohemian Grove.
*  Let's get into the tenocracy.
*  Let's get into who runs things.
*  Let's get into the mindset.
*  Whatever points you want, and I'll try to shut up and go through it.
*  This is Tim Dillon's will.
*  Because you're saying they want mortality on the roads.
*  Look at this thin, young, handsome, boyish, baby-faced Alex Jones.
*  That's 2004, but I knew you in like, 1998.
*  Well, in 98.
*  I met you in 98, but then I got to know you in 99.
*  This was when you were, 98 was when you were protesting.
*  And this is my clip.
*  You guys are welcome to play this.
*  It's really good.
*  Yeah.
*  I'll sign a form.
*  What is going on in this clip?
*  He's interviewing a lizard.
*  No, this is latest.
*  This is the...
*  There's been a lot of different newspapers, and that's the Bohemian Grove.
*  You want to start it over.
*  It's David Gergen.
*  Let me set it up.
*  Let me set it up.
*  96.
*  Let me set it up.
*  Okay, you got it.
*  It's right when he goes.
*  David Gergen, I'm outside.
*  That's the main thing in New York where everybody plays.
*  By the way, this is when Bill Hicks was alive, so I can confirm that you are not Bill Hicks.
*  Madison Square Garden.
*  Madison Square Garden, and here comes David Gergen, the Karl Robb of like four or five
*  administrations.
*  And I knew that he was part of the actual ritual at Bohemian Grove, so I bring it up
*  to him and he blows up at me.
*  Here it is.
*  He's like eight feet tall.
*  Can we just a few questions about the convention?
*  Yeah, well, is there a camera?
*  Yeah, right there.
*  Just about, yeah, I just want to get your permission first.
*  Here.
*  Okay, okay.
*  Just look, I've got...
*  No, I understand.
*  Just about a minute or two.
*  Okay, great.
*  We're talking to David Gergen and he has advised several presidents and of course has written
*  quite a few books and is a, I would call you a political pundit or researcher?
*  Commentarian, over the hill, whatever.
*  One last question.
*  I read a Washington Times article many years ago where you had a comment about the organization
*  and then now it's been in the Wall Street Journal, it's been in a lot of different newspapers
*  and that's the Bohemian Grove.
*  And back in what was it, 1996 when you joined as a Clinton advisor, the Republicans were
*  criticizing you, oh, what about Bohemian Grove?
*  And then you countered them by saying, hey, I don't run around in the woods naked.
*  What did that mean?
*  Here is the before mentioned Washington Times article where he said, I didn't run around
*  naked like they do.
*  I don't know what quote you're referring to.
*  I'm not aware of any quote like that.
*  Listen, I am a happy member of the Bohemian Grove.
*  I like the folks who come there and it's really inappropriate for me to talk about the group
*  beyond that.
*  Thank you.
*  Have you been there for the ceremony with the cremation of care?
*  Frankly, I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
*  Now what we're watching for people that are just listening is a bunch of people wearing
*  robes that are burning an effigy in front of a giant statue of Moloch the owl god.
*  And it's the effigy of a child.
*  Well, I don't know if that it's what it is.
*  I think it's the effigy of a child.
*  It looks like a grown woman to me.
*  It's real mad right here.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Watch this.
*  Frankly, that's that I don't know.
*  Back in the five seconds.
*  We missed it.
*  I said you take part in the ritual.
*  Back in the five seconds.
*  I'm Alex Jones.
*  That's something.
*  Cremation of care.
*  Frankly, that's that I don't think that's something I need to talk to you about.
*  Really?
*  Well, I'm Alex Jones and I snuck in there in 2000.
*  I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the video.
*  It's been on national TV.
*  Well, I disrespect you for that.
*  You do?
*  I do.
*  But it's a lot of big public officials going in there.
*  You don't deserve to know.
*  You took an I don't know anything about you and I don't know anything about your film.
*  But if you go in there with an understanding, you violated that understanding by releasing
*  that film.
*  And I don't respect you for that.
*  Really?
*  You I'm sorry.
*  You took an understanding when you went in there that you would not do that film.
*  And you did.
*  Did you have an understanding when you went in there?
*  No.
*  Did you crash it?
*  Yeah, and it has no trespassing signs there too, doesn't it?
*  No, they put them up after.
*  Oh, I'm sorry.
*  I just walked in.
*  I'm sorry, sir.
*  I've been there before.
*  I know what the circumstances are and I'm sorry you violated the understandings.
*  That was not a gentlemanly thing to do.
*  What about the ritual?
*  Is the ritual gentlemanly?
*  That's all the people, these fucking heads of state and billionaires screaming.
*  Yeah, that's the other thing.
*  They run the world.
*  I don't owe you this comment.
*  I know.
*  I'm sure.
*  This is what's called ambush journalism and I disrespect you for that as well.
*  So thank you and goodbye.
*  Have you ever been in the ritual?
*  That's none of your damn business.
*  Oh.
*  Listen.
*  Oh, it's getting cocky.
*  You go around and make understandings with people and violate them.
*  You ambush people on the streets and that's inappropriate form of journalism.
*  If you wish to practice that, that's fine, but don't ask others to respect you for it.
*  You can do it.
*  You're a free American, like anything you want.
*  If you want to be uncivil and rude and ungentlemanly, that's up to you, but don't expect the rest
*  of us to say, oh well, you're a...
*  You guys are setting policy in there, Mr. Gergen.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Nobody sets policy in there.
*  We try to be gentlemen and obviously you don't belong there.
*  Weaving spiders come out here?
*  Yeah.
*  That is a three pointer.
*  Anyways.
*  That's a three pointer.
*  Listen, you could ignore that if it was like a bunch of poor people in the woods doing
*  that.
*  These guys are...
*  Even then I'd be worried.
*  Even then it would be weird.
*  Are the top of every industry in America.
*  It's at least curious.
*  Who goes in there?
*  Well, people are like...
*  Clint Eastwood's gone.
*  He's not really a member.
*  Look.
*  Look.
*  Is it fun?
*  Look.
*  It's 2,700 acres.
*  It was set up by Mark Twain and it was a liberal deal for hookers and gay dudes and just everything
*  else.
*  It's a big huge...
*  Would you say gay dudes?
*  What?
*  Gay dudes.
*  Oh, gay dudes.
*  I was like...
*  When Mark Twain set up, it was classically liberal.
*  It was partying.
*  It was their own 2,700 acres.
*  It was saloons.
*  They brought in female hookers.
*  There was gay guys in there, everything.
*  It was Bohemian Grove.
*  They called it that.
*  People did whatever they wanted.
*  It was open.
*  They had poetry and they had plays.
*  They had the rest of it.
*  Then by the time Howard Taft became president, the Republicans basically bought it.
*  The reason it's important is the Republicans go there to...
*  They ship in all these private hookers, all these jets land nearby, but they also have
*  a lot of gay sex, which they use then to basically compromise people into the cult.
*  So there's a lot of gay sex.
*  How do you know this?
*  It came out in news articles.
*  No one ever got footage of it.
*  I was in there for one day.
*  I snuck in.
*  I looked good back then.
*  They hit on me a lot.
*  I had people I recognized from TV walking over, hey, let's go right now.
*  It's a big gay hookup deal for Republicans.
*  I'm just telling you what it is.
*  Then they've got this ritual that's only the feeder group.
*  So I'm sitting there during the ritual and I'm like, hey, this is pretty cool.
*  The people go, shut up, I'll kill you.
*  And they're all taking it very seriously.
*  And I'm not saying it's a gay thing.
*  I'm saying some of that goes on.
*  So you were saying it was cool and people were getting angry that you were saying it's
*  gay?
*  No, I mean, I was just quietly going, oh, this is really interesting.
*  They're like, shut up.
*  This is a very important ritual.
*  And they were taking it very serious.
*  This hearse comes in with the body of a child.
*  It is an effigy.
*  They're not killed.
*  Well, it's just a bundle of sticks, right?
*  Well, it looks like a kid.
*  Later, others infiltrated later that worked there and got his photos of it.
*  It's an image of a kid.
*  It's a little kid.
*  Because Moloch in the biblical is who they sacrifice the Canaanites.
*  It's a bull, but they do it as an owl.
*  They do it as an owl, yeah.
*  But that's from the Bible, is you would sacrifice a child to Moloch.
*  Give not your children to the fires of Moloch.
*  And so I've given it to experts in religious history.
*  It's not even, you know, from Christian perspective.
*  It's a Faustian deal mixed with Babylonian and religious stuff from Tyre.
*  It's quirky.
*  Look at that.
*  Look at that owl god and look at the fire underneath the owl god.
*  And there's Ronald Reagan.
*  I mean, if you saw that, if you were in the woods and you just saw that, you would be
*  terrified.
*  And Richard Nixon said, Richard Nixon on the Richard Nixon tape says it's a gay orgy.
*  Richard Nixon said that?
*  You can pull up Richard Nixon talks about.
*  Yeah, Richard Nixon said something about it where he.
*  It's the most goddamn faggy thing you've ever seen.
*  I think it's just allowing.
*  Well, nothing against, that's what I think.
*  I think it's guys that aren't gay that are that are that engage in gay acts in the woods
*  and then they have something on each other similar to Epstein's Island.
*  That's it.
*  That's what it is.
*  It's a rich.
*  It's a it's a it's like a fraternity doing that.
*  You've got to screw it up.
*  So is that pazing?
*  Hold on a second.
*  What is this here?
*  And they don't allow women.
*  No, it says founded in 1872 by a group of male.
*  That's the context that YouTube has been talking about Bohemian Grove.
*  This is the title of the video.
*  See, I told you founded 1872.
*  Richard Nixon Bohemian Grove most faggy goddamn thing he could ever imagine.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes, play it.
*  100% play it.
*  I want to hear the Nixon tapes.
*  Yeah, let me hear this.
*  Let's look at Northern California.
*  Northern California.
*  You know, San Francisco, there's God.
*  It's clear over time, but it isn't just down the right part of town.
*  But the upper class in San Francisco is that way.
*  The Bohemian Grove that I attend, it's not just the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  It's the upper class.
*  One time at a time, the East, the others have come here.
*  But it is the most faggy goddamn thing you will ever imagine.
*  San Francisco crowd goes in there.
*  San Francisco crowd goes in there.
*  It's just terrible.
*  Okay.
*  So weird.
*  The owl and the, it's interesting and I don't know how seriously they take it.
*  I mean, that's a real question, right?
*  Well, yeah.
*  I mean, the whole gay thing is a side issue.
*  Right.
*  The point is, is that I've talked to people that, I mean, according to Ted Gunderson, the
*  first time I ever heard about this was from this former high level FBI agent who was going
*  to be the FBI director, but he wouldn't go along with corruption.
*  So he wasn't.
*  It's on record.
*  Gunderson almost became the FBI director.
*  And he blew up like the things like the Franklin scandal and he's been a, he's the finders
*  and the finders club, which was huge, which were the CIA was caught trafficking.
*  You know, the finders is a cult that was caught trafficking children and the CIA squashed the
*  Florida and then Gunderson got it raided in DC and found a whole CIA facility with the
*  snuff films, everything.
*  And so he told me about all this and I thought he was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Even though he was Ted Gunderson.
*  You told us about it and we actually pulled up one of those stories and I was correct.
*  Yes, you're correct.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  So Ted Gunnerson is the reason I know about this.
*  And he said, he said that they get people interested with, with that ritual.
*  Most there's like 2000 members.
*  They bring about a thousand guests.
*  Not everybody can bring a guest.
*  I want the head of each camp to bring a guest.
*  Most of them are nice.
*  Clint Eastwood goes there, you know, Danny Glover goes there, but it's an all male deal.
*  Who's the other one?
*  Danny Glover.
*  Oh, Danny Glover.
*  I'm just mentioning, who's the weapon?
*  Danny Glover.
*  I saw him there.
*  How the fuck is he in there?
*  They probably like him from the movie.
*  He's just a fun guy.
*  I saw him when I was there.
*  I saw Danny Glover.
*  Interesting.
*  I'm starting to believe this is not, I'm starting to believe we can get in.
*  I'm starting to believe it's not that exclusive.
*  Oh, Joe Rogan.
*  They'd have him in immediately.
*  I mean, not now.
*  Do a podcast in front of the owl.
*  But I just want to say that overall it started out as a truly artsy liberal thing that I
*  think is good.
*  Guys deserve to go off the woods like we've done since humans were humans and party and
*  do whatever.
*  Right.
*  And so, and so it's, but the thing is then the weird skull, here's what happened about
*  1900, Skull and Bones that was at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, that was a German
*  death cult.
*  It took over Bohemian Grove.
*  And that's when they set up that as the central deal.
*  So it's this big inviting fun party.
*  What happens at Skull and Bones?
*  Because that's one of the other rumors about Skull and Bones.
*  I can tell you.
*  They compromise you.
*  They compromise you so that you're always a part of this organization.
*  Before he died, I did multiple interviews with Anthony Sutton, the top congressional
*  advisor to Senator Frank Church.
*  And we only know about Sutton because Charlotte Iserby, whose father was high level Skull
*  and Bones, gave him all of their internal manuals.
*  And she's been a frequent guest.
*  She's retired now.
*  America's secret establishment, an introduction to the order of Skull and Bones.
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  This is a Russell Trust, true Illuminati.
*  Illuminati set up 1776 to counter our revolution by Adam Weissob.
*  It funds the Jacobins.
*  It funds the French Revolution.
*  It's the opposite of a true egalitarian, open liberal revolution.
*  It's the leftist.
*  Always say they're the liberal.
*  Liberal and leftist are two different deals.
*  Leftist is left hand past Satanism.
*  Liberalism is egalitarian, open society, true liberalism.
*  And so the left hand path set this up.
*  They sent all this opium money they had over in 1831 to Yale to set up a German secret
*  society of the Illuminati, which then has become one of the dominant secret societies.
*  And in there, they do actual satanic rituals.
*  They get in coffins.
*  They do simulated human sacrifices.
*  They have gay sex as part of the ritual.
*  They bathe in huge facilities of feces.
*  This was made by Robert De Niro made a movie.
*  Skull and Bones are doing that stuff now.
*  Absolutely.
*  I know somebody broke into it.
*  But wow.
*  Who's the how can this be proven?
*  Well, Matt Damon made a movie called The Good Shepherd, I think.
*  Yes.
*  And in that it's Robert De Niro directed it.
*  OK.
*  And that's super accurate.
*  Where it's got the sword and the devil and they're in these big vats of cow manure.
*  They did leak a Facebook photo album of a bunch of Skull and Bones kids hang on a dear
*  island that kind of look like losers.
*  I know they're not.
*  I know they're not, but they kind of look like losers.
*  I mean, it was kind of like a lot of billionaires look like losers.
*  Yeah, they look like emaciated.
*  You were like, these are the these are the Illuminati.
*  It was kind of like, no, I totally agree with you.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember ABC News because they wanted to get Bush in trouble right before the 2004 election.
*  Another frat was able to because they're all doing this crap, shoot video down into it
*  where they're going devil equals death, Satan.
*  And they had girls they finally brought into the membership.
*  It was all boys before.
*  Yeah.
*  Sacrificing.
*  So of course, it's idiotic.
*  They're not getting wheels for what they do.
*  But inside they go grave rob.
*  They've got Geronimo skull.
*  Yeah.
*  The judge HW Bush stole supposedly stole Geronimo skull.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to do things like I don't know if that but that's that's a legend rumor thing.
*  Yeah.
*  It's what it's been broken into.
*  Yeah.
*  One time the police went in there.
*  But the point is, is that Skull and Bones Order 322 is the Illuminati Germanic death
*  cult that now set up chapters all over the U.S.
*  And it took over Bohemian Grove around 1900.
*  And so that's why Bohemian Grove is still this artisan, you know, deal of elitist artists.
*  But then it got co-opted by the Republican Party in Skull and Bones.
*  And Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, wrote Men in Power as a Political Retrospective.
*  We retired in the late 80s saying, I love our Illuminati rituals that we have in Germany
*  in our own sacred groves.
*  But I think they've taken it to a new level with Skull and Bones at Bohemian Grove.
*  I really enjoy the time we have there.
*  So these are just these elite institutions where, and Skull and Bones, I think they seek
*  to like create close friends amongst people that may not know each other, create loyalty
*  amongst this group of people.
*  That's why they got to tell them all the things they've done.
*  Yeah, you got to tell them all the sexual history, all that stuff.
*  They want these people to be loyal to each other so when they, they're not loyal to the
*  laws of America, they're loyal to this oath that they take with each other.
*  Exactly.
*  And it's like a Team America.
*  Look at this.
*  Descendants sue Skull and Bones over Geronimo's bones.
*  Documents show George H. Bush and George W. Bush's grandfather robbed Geronimo's grave
*  members.
*  Members of the Secret Society allegedly steal valuable things and put them in tomb.
*  Great-grandson says Geronimo should be buried in accordance with tradition.
*  Federal law protects Native Americans' rights to their family members' remains.
*  And let's expand on that, what he just said, because this guy's done his studying.
*  It's like a Team America when the head guy goes, no, no, nobody says, he goes, suck my
*  cock Gary, it's not about sex.
*  In Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, what he said is most of these guys are not gay.
*  It's an act of dominance, like, oh, you're a senator, you want to be president, bend
*  over and like a former president screws you in the ass.
*  And that's what they do.
*  I mean, the ritual is, I'm in charge, bend over.
*  Well, isn't that a thing with fraternities anyway?
*  Like hazing, the jizz on a cracker?
*  Exactly.
*  Next deal.
*  Yeah, but most people in fraternity, I mean, these are the top kids.
*  These are kids that they think are going to occupy leadership positions in the world.
*  And often do.
*  And often do.
*  So even though-
*  Let me give you an example.
*  Even John Ronson saw the photo with me when we snuck into Bohemian Grove.
*  And they had it hanging in, and people say, why don't you get a video?
*  I have a camera hidden right here.
*  It's Henry Kissinger bent over in a woman's dress, sticking his fingers in his ass.
*  Bill Clinton in a blue dress in Jeffrey Epstein's house.
*  Yeah, but that's just an artist's rendition.
*  Do you know that that was just an artist made that?
*  Maybe this was an artist's rendition.
*  We're in a clubhouse.
*  Ronson wrote about this.
*  Oh, so it's a photo or a painting?
*  It looked like a photo, but let's just say it's a painting.
*  I don't know.
*  I mean, it's ancient memory 20 years ago.
*  20 plus, you know.
*  But I mean, Ronson's like, look at that.
*  I'm like, is that Kissinger?
*  Yeah, and it's Kissinger.
*  It's all about being improper.
*  And they all go get caught to compromise each other to be in the club.
*  It's a hazing thing.
*  So that they can trust each other because they're all doing shady shit.
*  Yes.
*  But it's an artist's rendition.
*  Why is Jeffrey Epstein having in his townhouse a picture of the president in a blue dress?
*  Well, because the president flew in his fucking plane 26 times.
*  That's what I mean.
*  And by the way, his wife, Maxwell, is now come out in court.
*  It's getting no attention confirming, OK, Clinton did fly to that island.
*  That broke four days ago.
*  It's gotten zero attention.
*  Yeah, they're not paying attention.
*  We haven't heard anything other than those court documents that just came out.
*  Listen, I told you.
*  Listen, guys, it's not like I'm even that special.
*  My mom's brother was a famous helicopter pilot in Vietnam running black hops into Laos and
*  Cambodia and stuff.
*  And then he I shouldn't tell these stories, but no one's ever heard the stuff.
*  But you know, I remember growing up and telling me this stuff and it was it was true like
*  they were like, I'm not going to do it.
*  Please, please.
*  I just can't do it.
*  What's the danger?
*  You said so much.
*  Well, I mean, let's just say he took the fall for something that was going on.
*  He didn't get in trouble for it.
*  He got promoted.
*  He was involved in Iran, Contra.
*  And that's how people get promoted.
*  They fail upward by taking a lot of times to blame for something or this is that's like
*  common. So I grew up.
*  I mean, I grew up not just him, but other family that was it was like something special.
*  You know, but those Navy SEAL guys, you got security done a bunch of crazy stuff.
*  That's what our military does.
*  It's not what you hear on the news.
*  Right. And and and it's just completely out of control stuff.
*  And I mean, my uncle told me, he said, he said, yeah, I know, I got out of working for
*  these groups and everything as, you know, an army officer that was sheep.
*  Yep. You wouldn't.
*  You wouldn't. You wouldn't wear an army uniform.
*  So yeah. Right.
*  We were talking high level.
*  Yeah. Talking, running the real stuff like special ops.
*  Yeah. Well, he was in charge.
*  You like the command base in Guatemala City, right?
*  Because he was like a top Morse code guy.
*  Yeah. Of course, he had satellites that but nobody could read this Morse code coded.
*  So he was sending stuff to the White House, Morse code.
*  Like he was like when he was a kid, he was a champion Morse coder.
*  So he wasn't just in command.
*  He was like running all the stuff.
*  And he just said, I had to do it because he said it was kids being smuggled out of
*  orphanages by the CIA for sex ops in D.C.
*  Jesus Christ. He told me that.
*  He told me that when he was dying of pneumonia.
*  Jesus fuck.
*  Now, what is it with kids?
*  Why is the way to compromise people?
*  It's the it's the energy to. Yeah.
*  I mean, if somebody will hurt kids and he would if somebody will hurt kids.
*  What else? They'll do anything.
*  But that's what everyone's so terrified of today, right?
*  That there are some sex trafficking and sex cult.
*  And there's 10 times over 10 times the bust people.
*  But that's like and they are, though. But that's a fact.
*  Right. But if you want to get like when on shit gets wild and it's sloppy and messy.
*  And you've talked about that, too.
*  It gets sloppy and messy.
*  And they're not right about everything.
*  But the idea there are human traffic.
*  The the human on is just people on the Internet like playing games,
*  LARPing, acting like they're taking credit for something.
*  And a lot of are good people.
*  It's just that you can give them like bona fide like, look, they just busted
*  a giant child trafficking ring. Associated Press.
*  They don't want that. They want no.
*  There's underground bases and there's dinosaurs.
*  There's a real shit.
*  They don't want the real.
*  So is it that they're just into things that are just huge,
*  more ridiculous than reality? Like what is.
*  Yeah, because it's escapism and Hillary's in prison secretly.
*  Oh, right. I think they just learned about the world over the last year
*  and it melted their mind.
*  Like you've been looking at.
*  When you were on with Joe a few months ago, you crystallized it perfectly.
*  They've been asleep.
*  Now they've woken up and now they think everything's a cartoon version.
*  We'll say like you said. Yeah.
*  Well, it was just like, again, it's like if you didn't know anything about
*  the Frank that scandal, you didn't know about Epstein.
*  You hadn't read these books.
*  You didn't know the stories your uncle told you.
*  And then eventually you just found out there was an island
*  where all these politicians were going to and having sex with kids
*  and they were getting compromised.
*  Your mind would melt and then you would get paranoid.
*  And then you would start thinking that everybody's a pedophile
*  and that there's tunnels underground when the reality is it is bad.
*  But sometimes you have to take a step back and take a breath
*  and realize that like there are good people and not everybody is evil.
*  But there is a lot of evil out there.
*  But you got to take a step back and try to realize like what is what?
*  Well, there's one picture of Clinton getting massaged by this woman.
*  And they were using it as sort of evidence.
*  But the woman's clearly a woman.
*  She's in her 20s and they were saying she'd been working for him
*  since she was like 15.
*  Let's never use Clinton as the example of the QAnon people being wrong.
*  Not even when I'm saying never there is that's a grown woman.
*  She's a grown up. Yeah.
*  So listen, let's be clear.
*  The media did a limited hangout.
*  They went with these whistleblowers instead of all the other people.
*  And the fact that the witnesses reported at Epstein Island
*  in the Caribbean, Little St. George and the other island, too,
*  that boats would pull up the middle of the night, the shacks
*  with with little brown kids.
*  And those are the ones that get disappeared.
*  But who reported this?
*  It's in it's in the it's in major documentaries.
*  It's in Netflix documentaries.
*  It's in all the witnesses we talk to.
*  And they said my witnesses, my people I talked to over 10 years ago said,
*  you remember me telling you about it?
*  They've got an island in the Caribbean.
*  They've got an island in the Mediterranean.
*  They've got ranches in the southwest and that they.
*  Well, he had a ranch in New Mexico.
*  Yeah, that came out later. I wasn't told exactly where.
*  I mean, the idea that these kids would disappear potentially isn't crazy.
*  I know it's not crazy. It's not crazy at all.
*  Here's an example.
*  I was told by a high level source that major Hollywood producers
*  by name ran a cult where they branded women
*  next to their vagina, the Nixxiom thing.
*  But I put out two years before it broke.
*  I was told this by a high level source.
*  I remember you talking to me about it.
*  And then they had a they even had articles going in.
*  How do you post Jones claims?
*  Harvey Weinstein's connected to groups that, you know, do all this.
*  And I was just going off what people told me.
*  And I said, I didn't even say Weinstein.
*  That's what's crazy is they were already trying to cover it in case I said that.
*  They're like, oh, Weinstein's on all the branding women.
*  Well, it never even came out. He was it was the other guy.
*  So it's just like what you said did turn out to be true.
*  Yeah. As fantastic as it sounded, as outrageous, as ridiculous.
*  It turned out to be true.
*  And now it's in the news.
*  First time I ever heard of Ted Gunnarsson, let me pull him up.
*  Ted Gunnarsson, it's on Wikipedia up to be FBI director.
*  He was the head of L.A.
*  Imagine when he learned there, he's telling me he goes, man, I've been the FBI 20 years.
*  I got to be the head of L.A.
*  He goes like this devil worshiping everywhere.
*  Blew me away. You know, pedophilia, you name it.
*  He knew about the Manson thing, really being a satanic ritual.
*  And there's a senator from Nebraska named John DeCamp, who I know he was friends with,
*  who he was friends with. And John DeCamp was a guy who he blew the whole thing wide open.
*  Like he was CIA. He blew the whole thing wide open.
*  Did you see him? You think?
*  But he was what he told me. I was friends with.
*  He was one of the good ones.
*  Like he was involved in Operation Phoenix.
*  And then they kill. Well, well, that was that was his mentor.
*  So DeCamp's mentor was a guy who was a high level CIA guy.
*  Jamie could pull that up.
*  He was in a Phoenix operation and he was killed.
*  And I think in the in the in the in the in the canoe.
*  And you know, the dinner was still on the table.
*  He was killed in a canoe.
*  Yeah. This was a high level CIA guy.
*  John DeCamp was a Nebraska senator who broke open this human trafficking operation.
*  This, by the way, I'm having a hold on.
*  Yeah. No, it's a pedophile cult.
*  It was trafficking kids across America.
*  And it was a senator out of the Omaha federal Omaha federal credit union.
*  He was being run by a guy named Larry King, who was this rising star in the Republican Party.
*  He's probably still alive.
*  He has pictures of Maureen Reagan, all that stuff.
*  These kids were being trafficked to D.C., to L.A., to New York, wherever.
*  DeCamp stumbled upon this stumbled upon the occult, weird ritual shit going on, too,
*  in addition to the pedophilia and all that.
*  And then he went to this guy, his mentor, who we knew from from Vietnam, from the military,
*  who was a CIA guy whose name is escaping me, William Colby, William Colby.
*  He went to William Colby and William Colby basically said to the camp, listen,
*  you're going up force, you're going up against forces that are way too powerful.
*  You don't even know what you're you're knocking on here.
*  And then William Colby, I think, changes mind and said, fuck it.
*  You know what? We should stop doing like let's if we're going to fight this, let's fight it.
*  And then a little while later, William Colby, who was in great health,
*  kind of has a accident in his canoe is found dead
*  in a river right by his house with his dinner still on the table.
*  So it's like nobody nobody gets up in the middle of the dinner to go canoeing.
*  So this has been a common theme forever, whereas if you go against these these people,
*  you find you're dead.
*  He was 76 when he drowned, though.
*  Yeah, but in a canoe while his dinner was still on the table.
*  Sometimes people have heart attacks when they're 76.
*  I understand. I understand that.
*  OK, we're connecting dots here that maybe we don't need to disclose. OK.
*  William Colby, director of Central Intelligence, chose to disclose
*  some of the nation's darkest secrets to save the spy service he loved.
*  Drowned on April 27th in a tributary of talk to folks.
*  They killed him. They killed him.
*  He was 76. How about this guy, Gary Caradore?
*  He was a private investigator hired to get to the bottom of the.
*  It's like Barry Seale, man. They're getting rid of the people.
*  They just get rid of them.
*  All right. So we've done Bohemia Grove.
*  We've done Bohemia Grove.
*  Let me tell you, Senator DeKamp was on record running major level
*  Operation Phoenix, which was a high level CIA torture operation
*  and an execution operation.
*  So Apocalypse Now is kind of based on some of the things they did.
*  But he's on record, highly decorated that I don't want to go too far away
*  from the Epstein thing, so I still have a whole lot more.
*  Let's go back to Epstein.
*  OK. The island itself.
*  Like, first of all, Epstein had this crazy place in New York.
*  Seven story palace that the guy who owned Victoria's Secrets,
*  he gave it to him.
*  Yeah, because of probably blackmail. Right.
*  And then there was other billionaires who it turned out had.
*  And this is like had been glossed over, including Bill Gates.
*  Bill Gates stays there and tried to deny it.
*  But Bill Gates denies staying with Epstein,
*  but confirmed he stayed there and in his Paris home. OK.
*  And this was also he met with him post his first arrest. Correct.
*  Yes, because he was arrested.
*  A lot of people did. Chelsea Handler at dinner with him, I believe,
*  after the arrest, too.
*  I mean, a lot of people looked past that apparently.
*  Yeah, that British royal.
*  OK. Bill Gates met with Jeffrey Epstein many times despite his past.
*  And I got to say, Jamie's really fast.
*  He's the best. He's the best.
*  I mean, so let's let's go back to this.
*  Mary, we're we're getting we're not a huge interest in tech.
*  We love tech. Yes. Yes.
*  And he wanted to he brought scientists and big tech people
*  over his house in New York City. Here's the deal.
*  They were doing I said this over 10 years ago
*  that they were involved in secret breeding programs for cloning.
*  OK, before we get to that, scientists,
*  how were they getting these scientists?
*  Where are they getting all the money? First of all,
*  where's he getting the money? Get the silent.
*  Where is he getting the money to to buy this giant or get he was?
*  We now know that he was a nexus point from the dirty sides
*  of the CIA, MI6 and Mossad, at least. Yeah.
*  And so they were compromising people.
*  And then as he would compromise people, most of them knew
*  they were being compromised.
*  They wanted to be compromised to be let in to then run operations.
*  And we give it even more money.
*  He was also the money manager for a guy named Les Wexner,
*  who's a billionaire who owns Victoria's Secret, the limited, among other things.
*  And that's the guy who was gifting Epstein a property.
*  He gave him a seven.
*  Well, that's where he got some of the first money.
*  Well, Eric Weinstein, who was a legit financial guy, looked at him
*  and said, this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.
*  Of course, he said he's playing a role.
*  And then scientists were like that, too, when they went to his house to go,
*  Oh, Epstein's is like playing a role.
*  Yes, he has no, you know, so whatever he's doing, he's working for somebody.
*  Let me tell you, they want to corrupt the scientific elite
*  to go along with their agenda on climate change,
*  to go along with their agenda on viruses, to go along with their agenda,
*  because they know scientists are respected.
*  So you want to have them compromised.
*  So they go on whatever it is you want.
*  So whatever it is you want.
*  So if you want to do something and manipulate reality to
*  make your agenda go through, you compromise the scientists.
*  And then these elite experts who you have on film
*  having sex with 16 year olds, then you guess.
*  So maybe man make over.
*  Maybe man make level warming is real and really bad.
*  Doesn't matter the solution they have as a global tax, you pay them.
*  So it's a scam.
*  But as big as Epstein was, he was small compared to these other
*  finders groups and other organizations.
*  They even came out in the news at the time in the late 80s, early 90s.
*  And then the communist Chinese, they're running the blackmail
*  rings with Hunter Biden and the Democratic Party and Diane Feinstein
*  and all these people at levels way, way, way above anything
*  anybody else has seen.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I always I always got a bad feeling from Diane Feinstein.
*  I never had any turned out her main her main assistant was a Chinese actual agent.
*  Yeah, that's going Maxwell.
*  Powell pleads for release says jailed heiress
*  starving and humiliating clothes.
*  And that's unfair for her.
*  And I think, I mean, this one elitist statement release, he says, give her
*  a you know, oh, she's I mean, on record, this one was involved in all these
*  horrible things and now, oh, my God, she said humiliating clothes.
*  Why do you think Trump said, like when they asked her about it?
*  Well, I wish her well.
*  He's always smartass, like because Epstein was killed in prison.
*  So he's like, I wish her well, because they want to get data.
*  He's also like a rich guy.
*  He knew her. Right.
*  I mean, well, he later clarified it.
*  I gave you I told you what he said.
*  Do you think Trump's cleaning everything in this?
*  I mean, oh, you want to get the M.O. on Trump?
*  Well, I would like to, because I know that you're I'll give you.
*  No, no, no. Here we go.
*  My only superpower is that I really try to give me the accurate thing.
*  I mean, I'm always right about 95% of the time.
*  That's why earlier we went on that rabbit troll.
*  What I'm saying, listen, Trump doesn't like lobbyists.
*  He fired them all and trying to make the best decisions for everybody
*  in a pragmatic free market to not have one side of trade deals.
*  But his blind side was by him not letting lobbyists in.
*  Everyone around him became unofficial lobbyists.
*  That became a 20 minute rabbit rabbit.
*  What's I'm not bitching about? OK.
*  But let me tell you about Trump.
*  Trump's dad was a super right wing pro-America dude
*  who was actually a huge funder of the John Birch Society.
*  He introduced him to
*  the head of the House Un-American Activities Group
*  that worked for Nixon and Eisenhower that actually ran the Red Scare.
*  Some of it was good, some of it was bad. Roy Cohen.
*  And so his personal lawyer for 25 years was Roy Cohen,
*  who was like Joe McCarthy's best friend, right?
*  Joe McCarthy's chief of staff chief of staff.
*  I mean, he ran it. He ran it. Yeah.
*  He ran House and Senate.
*  He was he was the big enchilada.
*  And so Trump was actually heavily influenced by his father
*  that was anti-communist, acted nice and liberal in New York,
*  but like knew all this John Birch Society.
*  Like, you know, we're talking whole nine yards.
*  Well, wasn't Roy Cohen also involved in some blackmail stuff?
*  Oh, he was huge. OK.
*  Absolutely. And it was the whole gay mafia stuff. Right. Right. Right.
*  Yes. Thanks, Chris. You guys are deep. You deep in this.
*  I know that. Yeah, I know this.
*  Well, it's all a sleep listening to every night.
*  I would fall asleep. I'd listen to about a half hour.
*  And then I would trail off him.
*  All right. Right. Right. The globalist.
*  And I'm full sleep.
*  And now I can't do that anymore.
*  Thank you, YouTube. You can info wars.com.
*  I know I'm half way into this.
*  I should say people ask where people come to me and say, I used to love you.
*  I'm sorry you're off air now.
*  We have record traffic at info wars.com and banned dot video banned dot video.
*  We have videos.
*  I've had videos this week with three million views, two million views, a million views.
*  Yeah. So I predict Ben Avery watches in fours that comic during holidays.
*  You can't be having Christmas.
*  I'm in a room watching it.
*  So speaking of censorship, YouTube and Facebook have now banned
*  all the QAnon stuff, right, which is crazy.
*  Well, this is what's crazy.
*  Like, what's next?
*  You're going to ban JFK conspiracy.
*  Well, if I make a joke about QAnon, am I going to get banned?
*  That's the other problem for comedians.
*  It's like you said, the Young Turks show.
*  Well, it's the first time I've heard is the show that the Jacobins
*  because Tim Dillon had put the the show.
*  He put it.
*  I'm going to send it to you, Jamie, so you can see what it is.
*  I'm going to send you the video that Tim Dillon
*  or Tim Poole sent me.
*  I'm going to send it to you right now, Jamie.
*  So let me explain this.
*  OK, the Young Turks are anti free speech for everybody, including me.
*  And then she goes, but I'm not anti free speech.
*  I just want Alex Jones band.
*  But then they have this new show called the Jacobins.
*  Well, let's talk about evil.
*  The Young Turks were the group that ran the Armenian genocide.
*  They ran the Armenian genocide on record till over a million Christians.
*  They named themselves the Young Turks.
*  They go, oh, we don't know what that means.
*  Now they're called the Jacobins.
*  The Jacobins ran the French Revolution and were the Illuminati.
*  I told you about them earlier.
*  Yeah. So it's like every name they've got is like the Hitler youth, basically.
*  I mean, you know, the Young Turks and that is a very unfortunate name.
*  Well, they also people run around with, you know, the people that watch
*  a lot of those shows walk around with either the Chigavarish shirts
*  or they're unironically calling themselves Maoist.
*  These are like suburban white kids walking around going, I'm a Maoist.
*  I mean, it's kind of a hundred dollar smartphone.
*  It's right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That is a problem, too.
*  I think they're trying to do good and I think they think they are doing good.
*  I really do. I think when they thought that, hey, I'm not
*  anti free speech, but ban Alex Jones. Right.
*  They just don't understand what that means.
*  There's a reason why you can't just go around censoring people.
*  And again, the answer to bad speech is better speech.
*  Right. That has always been the answer.
*  But here's the big problem.
*  Once they silence you, they can then make up whatever they want.
*  Because people all the time.
*  Here's what's worse, Alex.
*  And this is you personally.
*  But the problem is when they silence someone, what they censor someone.
*  And then that person's not the that's that's not the target anymore.
*  They look for another target and they invariably go left.
*  They invariably exactly get on a power trip.
*  But hold on a second.
*  The left is not left enough.
*  So if you are a centrist, they'll call you all right.
*  Yeah, because you need to be compliant completely with the ideology.
*  If you're not compliant, they they will they keep moving
*  what's acceptable and what constitutes racism, sexism, classism, homophobia,
*  transphobia, it's a power grab.
*  But they keep changing it.
*  And they move the line.
*  Orwell talked about this in 1984.
*  Yeah, he was like, if you ban all the words, if you will, you will literally
*  you will you will change thoughts because you can't have all the
*  I forget Orwell's words on on on reducing language.
*  He said he said they want to reduce the language
*  where no one's even able to communicate.
*  And that's the goal.
*  So we think of as a leftist thing that's out of control.
*  No, I paraphrased it and I fucked it up.
*  But the point is what they didn't see, they didn't use hindsight.
*  They didn't they well, they didn't it's called Ingsoc.
*  Well, what they did.
*  It's so hard to talk with you.
*  What they didn't do is they didn't look.
*  Joe, you need to go.
*  I do. They didn't look to where this goes.
*  They didn't understand.
*  They didn't extrapolate.
*  They didn't say or maybe some of them did.
*  And some of them wanted to go.
*  If you start if you start censoring, there's a real.
*  And I know people are saying, no, you should censor people that say
*  terrible things because they influence our children.
*  And you you can't.
*  But Joe, it's a power grab.
*  They get off once they've got one scalp.
*  They're going to scalp everybody including themselves.
*  That's the motivation of the people that are doing it.
*  That's not what I'm concerned with.
*  What I'm concerned with is the problem itself,
*  because you keep finding a new target.
*  You keep finding a new a new person who is doing something that's.
*  That's what I'm saying. They don't want to give up.
*  They want more, more, more.
*  But it's not that they're trying to grab power.
*  It's just you're always trying.
*  Look, you've started a game.
*  Yeah, but they're losers and want to control reality
*  because they're projecting their own hatred of themselves on us.
*  You don't think part of it is that they want power to control the discussion.
*  There's most certainly a part of that.
*  Yeah, that's a part. That's human nature.
*  But Joe, you just said I'm hard to deal with.
*  Well, because you talk over people when they're talking.
*  You don't let them get the full. You've been talking a lot.
*  You get you don't let people get a full thought out there.
*  And Tim doesn't like when he's having his thoughts.
*  How the sensors are good.
*  What I was saying is he's talking and you jump in.
*  And the problem is, I know you have some things to say,
*  but then you fuck with the thing that's coming out of the other person's mouth.
*  OK, explain to me how the sensors are loving people.
*  That's what you're trying to do. Not saying they love people.
*  I'm saying they don't.
*  They're not looking at it correctly because the way they're looking at it,
*  they think they're doing a good thing and they're going to usher forth some
*  utopian world of communication where people are only saying the things they agree with.
*  The problem with that is you don't find out who's right unless you get everybody talking.
*  But I agree. But Joe, it's worse than that.
*  You can't have an echo chamber. It's dangerous.
*  Echo chambers are dangerous.
*  And what tech has done is created these left wing ideological echo chambers.
*  I totally agree.
*  And they're also forcing people into self censorship,
*  because if you don't comply with the rules that they've set forth,
*  then you get banned. So you comply and you you you find you find people.
*  It is a cult. Ideologically, like this.
*  Listen, it is a cult.
*  Joe, I think there's a lot of these.
*  You know what I'm trying to say to you is you've never been not smoking weed with me on air.
*  You know, it's a bummer. We should have had you come in a week.
*  You're angry. You're upset.
*  I wanted you to be on before the election.
*  Who do you think is going to win, by the way?
*  Donald Trump is going to win.
*  You think so? But then the Democrats are going to contest it.
*  We're going to have the 79 days.
*  Why are all the polls showing that Joe Biden is in the lead?
*  Do you think it's all bullshit?
*  Just like last time, they said Hillary was going to win.
*  Yeah, but these are the post post-election polls.
*  Joe, what I want to do is talk to you right now.
*  Why are you talking like that?
*  He's like a funny conspiracy phone sex operator.
*  Talk about what a sexy man you are right now.
*  I am channeling...
*  He's the only one here drunk.
*  This is a real problem.
*  I am channeling Tim Dillon.
*  That's not how Tim Dillon talks.
*  Tim Dillon's looking at you right now.
*  Do you really think that Trump is going to win?
*  Because he's close.
*  No, he's going to win big.
*  Interesting.
*  Really?
*  But they're going to think that.
*  But they're going to...
*  I was not trying to interrupt you earlier.
*  Well, this is how you talk.
*  It's OK.
*  You're an explosive guy.
*  You've got to let it out.
*  Stop passion.
*  Joe, you've talked twice as much in our last four hour podcast.
*  I love it.
*  This is the sober Joe Rogan.
*  Let's get back to this.
*  Trump.
*  What were we arguing about about political correctness?
*  I don't know.
*  But you were saying that we weren't arguing.
*  He was saying that the censors...
*  I was agreeing with you.
*  The censors, some of the censors are trying to do the right things.
*  And that you were saying, listen, it's deeper than that.
*  And then that's where we left off.
*  It's all been scientifically set up where they always say, oh, we're
*  for outliers now and dog whistles.
*  It's all about normalizing centralized control.
*  Big tech knows it's psychological algorithms.
*  It's totally destructive.
*  China that has people in Muslims in death camps, Christians in death camps,
*  Buddhists in death camps, is trying to totally normalize censorship here
*  domestically when the whole left is involved with communist China through
*  big tech and doesn't say a word about them.
*  They have no moral high ground to stand on, Joe.
*  Well, we have a real problem in this society when it comes to tech,
*  first of all, because all the people that are on the moral high ground
*  who are buying iPhones, you know where those things are being made.
*  We all know.
*  Everybody knows.
*  And I admit it. I admit it.
*  I admit it as well.
*  There's no iPhones that are being made in Ohio with highly skilled workers
*  that are paid an excellent wage and they have great health care benefits.
*  That's not what's happening.
*  I don't know why, but that's not what's happening.
*  They've decided that it's better to make them cheaper or better to have a higher
*  profit margin and make them in other countries, or at least they decided
*  that initially and now they're stuck.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Who do you think is going to win?
*  I will be very subdued.
*  Not something bad. Joe Jorgensen.
*  Yeah, I think Joe Jorgensen has a great shot.
*  She's a shoe in.
*  And then Kanye West.
*  I think Joe Jorgensen, Kanye West.
*  I think it's a it's a nail, but it's it's neck and neck.
*  Drives me crazy.
*  Think it's neck and neck. Right.
*  Jennifer Aniston was she made a tweet that said drives me crazy.
*  Is you're saying right now, I love you because you're not drinking.
*  Hold on a second.
*  There was a fucking hilarious
*  response by Kanye West.
*  She said Jennifer Aniston put on Twitter, hey, it's not funny to vote in for Kanye.
*  Don't do it.
*  And he goes, friends wasn't funny either. Hilarious.
*  He's right. He's right.
*  That's great. Friends was not funny.
*  But you see the two of them together.
*  Friends was a funny show. Joe, you were great on Friends.
*  I wasn't on Friends.
*  That's a joke.
*  Who do you think you think Trump?
*  I don't know. If you were a Friends character, who would you be?
*  I'd probably be Matt LeBlanc. Right.
*  Will you beat Jennifer Aniston?
*  I don't think so.
*  Who is Matt LeBlanc? His name is Joe.
*  Jennifer is the most successful.
*  I identify as Jennifer. He was dumb.
*  I'm dumb. Perfect.
*  Wouldn't you like to have a dentist like Jennifer Aniston and horrible bosses?
*  She was a dentist.
*  What did she do?
*  Molester patients when they were under.
*  OK, well, you could be molested by worse people.
*  Well, they're not kids.
*  I just think it's funny that they.
*  Yeah. Someone who's an actor would say that like this this thing that they feel
*  like they have this influence, they're going to change the way people vote.
*  This 80 days of hell you speak of.
*  What does that entail?
*  Just so I can mentally prepare myself.
*  79 days, 79 days of hell.
*  We're talking 79 days without Joe Rogan.
*  What's going to happen?
*  79 days of us locked up in here with cases of whiskey
*  and huge piles of marijuana.
*  He's lit. No, no, no.
*  You're a little lit, buddy.
*  I don't actually I can see that bottle and it was a fresh bottle.
*  When you said, no, that's that's that's fake.
*  That's Hollywood. That's not Hollywood.
*  We're in Texas.
*  I gave up Hollywood years ago.
*  I haven't worked in Hollywood a lot.
*  Let's talk about this. What were you just asking?
*  I don't know. 79 days of hell.
*  If the Democrats could test the election problem, 79.
*  See, this is not fair.
*  Seventy nine days of hell.
*  That's how many days there are after November 3rd to the inauguration.
*  And John Podesta in The New York Times, they had a big war game
*  with The New York Times sat in on a Democrat high level war game
*  with Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and all of them.
*  And they said, we're going to contest.
*  We think we're going to win.
*  But if we lose, we're still going to contest and we're going to contest.
*  And we're going to call for the UN to come there and occupy the US.
*  The UN is going to occupy the.
*  And then and then The New York Times came out and said we need the UN
*  to intervene in the US election.
*  And now the four horsemen just called for that yesterday.
*  Jesus. And so they are planning to have.
*  Who's the four horsemen?
*  AOC and the rest of the crew.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  And so those I thought that's the tribe anyways.
*  And so they're there.
*  And they're planning to have Western states, Western states secede.
*  And they're saying they're going to hold the election up.
*  You already saw this already denied the last election.
*  They can take Portland. Yeah, take it all.
*  Take this is the 79 days of hell.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  Yes. You when did you decide to try to escape California?
*  I told you the looting when the looting.
*  You told me off air.
*  Yeah, I had zero faith in their ability to maintain law and order,
*  because if you're going to pay all that money in taxes,
*  I feel like you should at least feel like they're protecting things.
*  And when they were just letting them smash windows and cops were told to stand down,
*  particularly in Santa Monica, there was like direct orders.
*  And the sheriff was being widely criticized for this.
*  They were told to stand down while these people were smashing and looting things.
*  When when they were doing that, I was like, well,
*  you can't live in a place where that's being tolerated because this is this.
*  This this goes from stores to, you know,
*  they'll move to nightclubs and move to restaurants.
*  They'll decide what they're going to smash.
*  It had nothing to do with George Floyd.
*  No, it had nothing to do with him.
*  I agree. Those restaurants, those stores had nothing to do with George Floyd.
*  And now, like in Minnesota, Minneapolis, the crime rates like triple.
*  The police won't even show up.
*  They're like, people are like, why are you even paying you?
*  Yeah. So so what do you think?
*  Both of you, Mr.
*  Dylan, what is the end game of this?
*  I'm going to finish my answer, because I'm not done yet.
*  It was also that there was restrictions that were put in place.
*  It didn't make any sense to me.
*  There's restrictions for restaurants, restrictions for comedy clubs,
*  restriction restrictions for gyms.
*  Like, why can't you just wear a mask?
*  Church is closed. Yes. But all but Walmarts open.
*  Well, why are churches closed?
*  But why is it OK to protest?
*  Why is everybody OK?
*  Why is everybody letting people protest? Right.
*  Why aren't they saying, listen, I understand your
*  want and desire to protest, but understand that you're most likely
*  contributing to the spread of this virus, because that's a fact. Right.
*  Even if you support the protests.
*  The agree. Yeah.
*  The end game seems to be if you let society get bad enough,
*  people will then accept all these more draconian
*  security measures and censorship across the board.
*  Would you think that's what's going on with California?
*  Like, why do you think they've kept California locked down this much?
*  They want to kill the U.S. economy.
*  China's been open for six months.
*  They admit it's leaked out that they're doing this to kill the U.S. economy.
*  Remember leaked out how?
*  Oh, let's come out.
*  Democratic Party reports it's been stated.
*  You heard Democrats all over the news say we want a depression
*  to make Trump look bad. Who said this? Bill Maher.
*  Yeah, but Bill Maher is not a part of the Democratic Party.
*  He's a comic. I know, but I used to know.
*  But he jokes around about that.
*  Like, look, OK, well, crash the economy.
*  OK, well, regardless, when Jews try to or Baptist in New York
*  try to have an event, the police show up and arrest them.
*  But then when Antifa or BLM was going on, burn stuff down,
*  the mayor said, it's great.
*  And the mayor said, de Blasio said, this is legitimate.
*  Antifa is legitimate. Your church isn't. Your synagogue isn't.
*  So it's power, it's selective enforcement.
*  It's martial law.
*  I have articles right here.
*  Because everything I brought today, I have the proof.
*  ABC News is reporting in blue cities in Texas
*  that they're going to come to your house and demand a covid test.
*  And if you don't, they're going to arrest you.
*  Well, the federal and state courts and rule, they can't do that.
*  Where's that being said?
*  El Paso, Texas.
*  But I want to bring you back to what you're saying about crash the economy.
*  You use Bill Maher as an example.
*  And I just don't think that's a credible example because he's a comic.
*  Well, he said that.
*  Yeah, but he's a comic.
*  And they always say he's not a bigger coverage than newspeople.
*  Now, that's what Kober and all the imposes.
*  Newspeople. Alex, you're you can't use him as an example
*  of someone who is a politician who is calling.
*  For the economy, the crash.
*  strategically, if I was a Democrat, I wouldn't want things to open up again
*  until Trump was out. Right.
*  Agreed. I mean, that's a greed.
*  If you want to China, China, China wants to shut down.
*  China admits they're using the virus to keep us shut down.
*  I think he's a bio weapon.
*  Well, I could give you an hour long treatise on COVID-19.
*  OK, we'll we'll get to that momentarily.
*  I don't want to anger you, though, before before we know.
*  I love being here. I'll sit here and like, tell far jokes if you want.
*  I'd rather get drunk and just have a good time before we get to that.
*  Tim, you said something that I want you to back up.
*  You said that the Democrats are trying.
*  I'm not denying the possibility that this is the case,
*  but this seems like if that was the case, it would be a grand conspiracy
*  that would at least have you'd have to have some evidence of this
*  to make that statement that they're trying or they want to crash the economy
*  because they they want to maintain power and to change censorship
*  and to change the way there are laws.
*  OK, well, we've had Governor Newsom, we've had Governor Cuomo,
*  Cuomo, exactly all say the economy isn't going to be open
*  because Trump's done a bad job.
*  We're not going to open until he's gone.
*  And then Whitmer's even come out.
*  But it's true. Wait a minute.
*  Newsom has openly said that. You sure?
*  Yeah, type it in. I mean, I'm.
*  But what do you think he said?
*  I've never I've listened.
*  I'm a criticism. I'm a critic of Newsom because of his this.
*  He's become an autocrat.
*  He's got his wineries open.
*  But there's a lot of issues, right?
*  There's a there's a lot of issues that they they close.
*  So many things. Joe, Joe, Joe.
*  Globalism was about selling America off and bankrupting us
*  under cloward and pivots.
*  Strategies. Fine. But don't don't change the subject.
*  I'm not specifically what Newsom has said.
*  They can pull it up.
*  It's like I told you about the AT&T.
*  What did he say that you think?
*  And again, I'm not a fan of him.
*  I'm a critic.
*  Listen, I think you got to give people grown adults the choice.
*  If they look, we don't have overrun hospitals.
*  We don't have people dying in record numbers.
*  We don't have five percent death rates.
*  We don't have one percent.
*  The cases and the deaths are increasing.
*  That is true.
*  But as long as there's a disease, they're going to increase.
*  The question is, at what rate?
*  And the people that are going to never have a morbidity factor.
*  It's never about the death rate.
*  It's always about increased infection because the death rates
*  way down now is it is right now.
*  But the winner hits, they're going to say it's flu and the cold.
*  I realize that you get me again.
*  When you say the deaths increase, that is going to happen.
*  The question is, by what rate and how many?
*  Right. Well, you take the normal flu and pneumonia and morbidity
*  like they did this year and you add that to the number.
*  They've already run the same scam.
*  And so whatever they don't count flu as a death or pneumonia anymore.
*  They all kind of cover because they get money on the chart.
*  They get 50 plus thousand dollars when they call it a COVID death.
*  Plus, when they say that they get 13,000 to say it's a COVID patient,
*  and they get 29,000 or whatever extra when they intubate somebody.
*  And so now since when is like Congress saying how to do medicine?
*  Well, isn't the idea that they're doing this to give money
*  to these hospitals to help them in the middle of a pandemic?
*  Yeah. So the.
*  But then the hospitals reason code everything is COVID to get the money.
*  That's come out.
*  They killed most people that died, died nursing homes or died from intubation
*  when it's an autoimmune event and you don't want intubation.
*  It's intubation that's killing people.
*  But they initially thought you did.
*  But that's why the numbers went down because they stop intubating.
*  Yes. So now it's all about everyone's being
*  before there's this high death rate because they were intubating
*  and they were counting on and they were killing old people.
*  As soon as they stopped shipping folks to old homes that weren't getting vitamin D
*  because no sun went like this.
*  So so infections like this, you can pull the graphs.
*  Yes. Like what's your science?
*  Pull it up. And you know, infections like this deaths like this.
*  Right. Well, you're going up and down, right? Death down.
*  Now, what did Gavin Newsom say, though,
*  that when you said that he said it's not going to get better until Trump's out of office?
*  Well, it's it's Whitmer that said that specifically.
*  And he said Cuomo, because I remember that, too.
*  But he was just basically like, well, I want to be friends with Trump.
*  There's been a bad response.
*  We've got to keep the lockdown going.
*  And, you know, until Trump does this wrong, until we have a change, it's going to continue on.
*  And then it's always about the power grab like, oh, it's two years.
*  We have to do it. Now it's now it's first.
*  It's 15 days to keep the hospitals empty.
*  And then it's then it's oh, six months.
*  And now it's two years.
*  And the gate said like a week ago, it's 10 years.
*  And now they've got the people vouching and others saying, no, it never ends.
*  You never shake hands.
*  And under the UN rules, they say, don't look at someone and turn your head.
*  So in Europe, you can type this in.
*  Citizens in the UK told, do not look at other people and turn your head.
*  It's cult programming, man.
*  I think it's a pretty common talking point.
*  And some people agree with it.
*  Like a lot of Democrats would say, yeah, it's not going to get better
*  until Trump is out because Trump has made a massive it.
*  I don't think Trump's done the best job.
*  That's what he said.
*  But that's that's a common.
*  What could you have done better?
*  Well, I'm done better.
*  He shut down flights from China in February when when Pelosi's
*  running around in Chinatown saying, yeah,
*  but I think it's a pretty common belief that they're saying, listen,
*  so I don't think it's a conspiracy.
*  I don't think like you have to find a source.
*  I think it's like they believe if he wasn't in it,
*  that it won't get better until he's gone.
*  So I don't think they actively are trying to make it better until he's gone.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  I want to keep the crisis going.
*  I do see what you're saying.
*  I just want to know if there's evidence.
*  I wonder if there's an actual statement where he said
*  when Trump leaves, then we'll open back up.
*  That's what that's actually what Whitmer said specifically.
*  But he said some more things.
*  Well, let's find where we want from memory here.
*  I mean, I understand.
*  But that's why I'm challenging you.
*  I love it.
*  But I'm I'm challenge you on this because I mean, he's a better online.
*  We're going to want to challenge you on this.
*  Right. So I want that's what they loved about our last interview
*  over a year and a half ago, which they loved was that people could go
*  and actually check the stuff I was saying.
*  I had a matter how crazy a lot of it is true.
*  So I want to find that quote now.
*  See if Whitmer said that it won't get better until Trump's out of office
*  in terms of the lockdown.
*  Whitmer, Whitmer, lockdown on until Trump's out.
*  So didn't she lose some court case recently?
*  Yes. Her Supreme Court, but also federal courts have ruled
*  across the country that you can't order churches to wear masks.
*  You can't order social distancing.
*  It's all just getting us to comply.
*  Don't you think it's a good idea to encourage people to wear masks
*  if they're going into large gatherings?
*  A lot of studies, a lot of studies show that doesn't even protect you.
*  Listen, listen, Trump told the truth a few days ago when he came out
*  and he said, we're never going to control this.
*  We have to learn herd immunity.
*  Or if you're really scared of a take a vaccine and the head epidemiologist
*  of Rockefeller Hospital came out and said that and got banned on YouTube.
*  I mean, listen, Italy did social distancing.
*  Italy did masks.
*  Italy did everything you were supposed to do.
*  And they're getting clobbered again.
*  So that makes me think that maybe it's not a bad idea to do these things,
*  but they don't seem to they don't seem to.
*  Sweden didn't do it.
*  Sweden didn't do any of it.
*  And it's the lowest death rate in Europe.
*  Right. But it's also a country of small villages.
*  They have a whole different way of life over there.
*  I mean, Italy, Italy is a bunch of three generations living in one house.
*  Yeah, that's the problem.
*  And they have the oldest people in Europe.
*  Yes. So, yeah.
*  And they need sunlight.
*  They need they smoke.
*  They're all good food.
*  Try finding a gym over there.
*  Well, when they smoke, they smoke on the train.
*  It's so every time I fucking go there, it's hard to find a gym.
*  They listen exactly.
*  They don't.
*  Joe, Joe, Joe, have a rest.
*  Joe, I came out eight months ago and I and I was selling this stuff.
*  But I said, get it the store.
*  Vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and zinc.
*  If you have that on the NIH website, it can't, according to the NIH website,
*  cannot replicate inside the mitochondria where the virus plugs into the cell
*  and makes it replicate.
*  OK. And so I just mean, like Jones claims he's got a cure.
*  No, it's not a cure.
*  If you've got sunlight and zinc and vitamin C and all these things you need,
*  it's very hard to get these things.
*  That's why it's old people in nursing homes,
*  them and outside of the years that are dying so easily.
*  Now, Fauci finally two months ago came out and said, you need vitamin D,
*  you need vitamin C.
*  That is true. And young Jamie takes vitamin D and he kicked in a day.
*  Yes. Vitamin C and zinc.
*  Young Jamie was feeling bad for a day.
*  But I don't want to argue, Joe.
*  I want to just say I love Bill Gates.
*  OK. I love I use Windows.
*  I'm looking for the quote.
*  I can't find a specific quote that says that.
*  There's lots of quotes about them going back and forth, obviously,
*  because they've had a public battle.
*  I just think anybody like that, whether it's Bill Gates or Bezos
*  or anybody who's a billionaire, if they say here's the suggested course of action,
*  they have to expect that they're going to be criticized.
*  And a lot of these guys don't like taking any criticism when they they're issuing edicts.
*  These are billionaires that are saying this is how we're going to live.
*  Yeah, that's the next big question.
*  Isn't it strange, though, that Bill Gates, who is not a health expert,
*  is all of a sudden one of the leading voices?
*  Yes, it's strange.
*  But that's my that's my next question.
*  Why is Bill Gates, who's not a doctor, suddenly on TV telling me
*  how my life's going to go and what I'm going to do?
*  This is the most important part.
*  Why is this a big project for him?
*  Well, he's also a guy that wanted to shoot a missile of dust
*  into the atmosphere to help climate change.
*  I mean, very few people in history have had the resources
*  to even think of doing something like that.
*  He wants to have jet spray chemicals to block the sun.
*  Right. And the scientists went over.
*  No good. They went. Not a good idea.
*  So and then if you call him on that, if you call him on that, he goes,
*  conspirator lies and the conspiracy theories.
*  It's like, no, we're just asking you why you want to shoot missiles into space.
*  He went on CBS News.
*  They go 80 percent of those taking your vaccine trial getting very sick.
*  Some are dying.
*  He's like, well, that's just how it is.
*  You can pull this clip.
*  What? Yeah.
*  He said, that's just how it is.
*  Yeah. He said, well, the FDA is going to approve it.
*  I like to see you.
*  He's being ready. Look at you.
*  You're blending in with the walls.
*  But yeah, it's a problem.
*  That's hilarious.
*  That's a problem.
*  It's a problem.
*  You know, I'm kind of retarded.
*  This is this is.
*  You remember for two years, they said Trump worked for.
*  I've heard of political mudslinging my whole life for two years.
*  They said Trump was an agent of Russia.
*  He was an asset of Russia, the president.
*  Then they did a whole report.
*  And then it came out that he was it.
*  There was no proof of it.
*  The CIA, the NSA, everybody.
*  And then they went like this.
*  He went, well, we might have been wrong about that.
*  I mean, it was my most disturbing things to me was when Ted Cruz was cross
*  examining Comey when he was asking him questions about what they did with evidence
*  and how they doctored evidence.
*  What do you got, Jamie? Oh,
*  I just can't believe that Brian Redban is here.
*  He saved us.
*  Brian flew in when Jamie tested positive for cooties.
*  And we had to have like 16 years protocol.
*  Yeah, ever.
*  So we had to have the protocol was you have to be 10 days
*  and you have to test negative three days.
*  Brian move before you come.
*  Brian's going to move here.
*  He's looking at houses right now.
*  You are, too. Tim's going to move.
*  I might. You're moving here, but I might come on.
*  So I know I got it.
*  I got it. I got to save L.A. first from the Satanist.
*  It's not coming back.
*  That I know. Let's talk about that.
*  I'm not coming back. Please.
*  A little bit of stuff. Yeah, I don't want to fight you.
*  I would not fight.
*  And I'm not. I'm just much apple juice.
*  I'm having trouble thinking. OK, it's OK. I love you.
*  No, you did this. Just have some.
*  No, I can't. I can't. I made a promise.
*  But on election night, I can pop.
*  Yeah, that's November 3rd. That's November.
*  But I will be able to pop in six more.
*  We're very excited.
*  I have six more days of sobriety.
*  That's going to be a fire. I got to be honest.
*  I'm a little high from this cigar.
*  Hey, you couldn't have a bigger promo for your election night.
*  I'm glad you actually announced it here.
*  Well, Kyle Kulinski has been asking when he can announce it.
*  So now, you know, Kyle, there you go. It's official.
*  There you go, Kyle.
*  I'm excited to get everybody in the right and watch.
*  Listen, I want to cover some of this real stuff here in real time.
*  Can I show you some stuff? Yeah, what do you got?
*  Do we ever find a quote for Whitmer?
*  I can't find anything.
*  There's lots of quotes, but I can't find.
*  Do you want me to find it?
*  Can you just Google on your phone?
*  Tim and I will talk amongst ourselves.
*  OK, then we'll then we'll pull up whatever that is.
*  OK, Gretchen Whitmer, they almost kidnapped her, by the way.
*  It is. I know I don't have. I'm just saying.
*  Oh, Whitmer, when Trump leaves office, quote, she was almost
*  I find there was a kidnapping plan against her.
*  No, it's Whitmer, which 50 percent of the lockdowns won't end till Trump gone.
*  That's just come on. Right.
*  Lockdowns won't end till Trump gone. Try that.
*  Whatever. I know it's true. I find it.
*  Whitmer lockdowns won't end till Trump gone. He'll find it.
*  Yeah, the plot to assassinate her.
*  What the fuck was that?
*  I thought so. I kidnapped her. That was weird.
*  But I predicted up front that it was going to be FBI provocateurs.
*  It turned out the two leaders were FBI informants.
*  What? What's even crazier is 52 percent of the citizens in Michigan
*  agreed with the plot. That's a joke.
*  Good one. They're going to edit that part.
*  We say that's a joke.
*  Joe Rogan's guest calls for kidnapping.
*  This is outrageous.
*  D platform.
*  Contro.
*  When I went on Alex's show, Alex goes, snopes.
*  Always goes and finds like jokes. He makes it there.
*  Go. They go, correction.
*  Hillary Clinton is not an oompa loompa.
*  Did you guys see that
*  Brett Weinstein's Unity 2020 account was also banned from Twitter?
*  My producer just told me that.
*  His Unity 2020 account, which was calling for a third party,
*  was calling for unity between people on the right and the left
*  to get together and have conversations and perhaps even have
*  an alternative candidate. That's outrageous.
*  Well, he's a fucking scholar.
*  And he's a guy who became famous because he was a professor
*  at Evergreen University and the leftist took over the college.
*  They said we're going to shut it down and whites can't come one day a month.
*  They they had and then they banned him.
*  Yes. Well, it was just banned him.
*  They went looking for him in the parking lot.
*  It's based around baseball bats. Yeah.
*  It was terrifying. So let me ask this.
*  The principal was going along with everything.
*  Literally, they yelled the principal, don't gesture with your hands
*  because you're threatening us.
*  But he was talking like this.
*  Oh, did you hear that?
*  They started laughing at British universities like Oxford.
*  I think it's the one looking up Oxford or Cambridge, one of the big ones.
*  You can't clap.
*  It's a microaggression, Joe.
*  Oh, that's so crazy.
*  But this is what we were talking about for years.
*  And people were saying, why are you concerned with what happens in the universities?
*  It's the same thing we were saying about censorship because it fucking
*  it keeps going. It doesn't stop.
*  Yeah. When you when you allow that kind of nonsense in universities,
*  those kids graduate and they want to carry these goofy fucking practices
*  into all of these corporations.
*  Let me ask you about this question.
*  Now, I want to see that now.
*  It's one of the things I wrote down.
*  I wanted to ask you, Joe and Tim Dillon.
*  What what happens?
*  Where do they stop?
*  Because they're going to keep running until they hit opposition,
*  which is starting to happen.
*  How far does it go?
*  I was hoping there was going to be some sort of a federal regulation.
*  I was hoping that Trump was going to step in and they were going to
*  amend the First Amendment to include social media, because I think
*  what you're what you're seeing now, the the argument that these are just
*  just private corporations.
*  I don't think that argument is valid anymore because the impact that they have,
*  the significance of being able to speak or not being able to speak to speak
*  has massive implications on our election.
*  We see this with the New York Post election meddling.
*  We see it with the New York Post being censored with this Hunter Biden story,
*  whether you agree with the story being leaked or not.
*  The fact that the New York fucking Post, which is a legitimate newspaper,
*  is outrageous as they are.
*  And the fact that the fucking White House press secretary gets banned from Twitter
*  for tweeting that link. That's very dangerous.
*  This is crazy. I mean, I think it leads to it.
*  Sadly, it leads to violence, because if you take everybody's ability
*  to communicate away, there's nothing left to do but commit acts of violence.
*  And by the way, that's a Kennedy quote.
*  Those that make peaceful revolution.
*  He found something.
*  This is as close as I could get to what was what he's asking.
*  OK, the Trump virus response is the worst in the globe.
*  She said, if you're tired of the of lockdowns or you're tired of wearing
*  masks or you wish you were in church this morning or watching college football
*  or your kids were getting in-person instruction,
*  it's time for a change in this country.
*  And that's why we've got to elect Joe Biden.
*  I mean, that's pretty.
*  That's right. I mean, you can make that say whatever you want.
*  Yeah, but that's the common sentiment, right?
*  The problem is the problem is if you just take it from if you're tired of lockdowns
*  and then you get one, you get one interpretation of it.
*  But if you back it up to the Trump virus response is the worst in the globe,
*  she said, if you're tired of lockdowns.
*  So what she's saying is, I think we're splitting hairs.
*  You mean you're not necessarily because what she's saying is,
*  OK, well I saw a clip of her in a speech saying that.
*  Because that's the problem with taking something out of context.
*  What she's saying is we got a wonderful person.
*  Trump's done. No, I'm not saying that.
*  What she's saying is that Trump has done such a shitty job.
*  That's the reason why we're locked down.
*  You can't go. I get it. I get it. The headline.
*  I don't know if that's true, though.
*  I think when you've got a contagious disease, you got people flying in from Europe
*  and China and all these other countries expressing you.
*  You're you're going to have spread.
*  This is a fucking insanely contagious disease.
*  And Joe, my favorite part of your show is when you ask J for something
*  and the light turns on when you're looking at it.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  You're in a new world.
*  Are you right now on scale one? It's not at all.
*  We're we're into numerology. This is when it gets good.
*  You better. OK.
*  Let's talk.
*  Just be nice to me, Joe.
*  I am nice to you. You got me here.
*  I know you are. Let's get serious.
*  Everybody wants to hear what I actually have to say. OK.
*  What was the question?
*  You had me on 9-11. Yes.
*  1255 now. One five five five.
*  Yeah. Don't connect the dots.
*  Just I'm in town. It's random.
*  Well, you told me you picked 9-11 on purpose.
*  Yeah, that was on purpose. Yeah.
*  It's just fun.
*  But this is nothing bad.
*  But this is you understand how this quote
*  you could interpret that in a different way.
*  Like, I think the entire Democratic Party strategy, I understand,
*  is to say Trump is to blame for covid, which and to say the economy shut down
*  till you get them elected.
*  Don't think that's what she's saying.
*  They're all they're all saying.
*  I understand. Joe Biden's like, we're going to end this covid
*  by endless lockdowns once Trump's out.
*  If you want to go back to normal, do this and their own.
*  Listen, this is a end of civilization event.
*  The Rockefellers and others put out Operation Lockstep.
*  They're never going to stop this.
*  They're going to have covid tracking.
*  They're going to have checkpoints.
*  They're going to have apps on your phone.
*  How do we stop this?
*  What Trump came out and did and said?
*  We cannot defeat this with vaccines.
*  And with covid tracking with shutdowns,
*  it's going to have to be with
*  herd immunity, which is what the scientists actually brought articles.
*  Why can't we beat it with what he beat it with?
*  He's 74 and he eats french fries every day.
*  This motherfucker kicked it in four days.
*  That's what I'm supposed to be a death sentence.
*  Joe, if you've got vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc, it's very hard to get.
*  OK, but clearly he's got more than vitamin D, vitamin C and zinc.
*  He's got a bunch of medical treatments.
*  Right. He was given a regeneron.
*  He was given things that are expensive and probably not widely available.
*  But wait a minute, Jamie tested positive.
*  He's right over there.
*  Jamie's young and viral.
*  I'm saying where since when?
*  Since when does something come along?
*  I never saw him.
*  He's also over.
*  Civilization is over because of this thing that came out of China.
*  You're supposed to come.
*  You want to ask where covid came from?
*  That's what it is.
*  Jamie, do you feel better about the disease now that you kicked it so quickly?
*  I mean, how old are you?
*  How old are you? 37.
*  37. At first, I was a little worried for the first day.
*  Oh, shit. We go.
*  Are we going down like a two week, three week, four week ventilator time months?
*  Right. Right. Because you've talked to people on the show that have been fucked up.
*  But sure. Yeah.
*  How lucky am I going to be today?
*  Is right. I was thinking.
*  And you were also taking all the vitamins.
*  I mean, yeah, I got all that.
*  We had an AD and I'm doing my sister.
*  Yeah. Like I don't. Maybe that helped.
*  I'm sure. Hopefully it helped.
*  Of course.
*  Hmm. Statistically, they said five percent of us will be dead.
*  It's not even well, they thought point one percent.
*  OK. But what they thought.
*  They're the all powerful gods.
*  It's like the UN says, you will not question us.
*  Big tech says you will not question anything.
*  The UN says, you know, the UN is like, oh, we shouldn't do a lockdown.
*  It's killing millions of people. Starvation.
*  But still, it's like we're keeping the lockdown going.
*  The United Nations said, well, what do you think should be done?
*  I mean, I think we should look at something that isn't much worse
*  to the flu and say we all need natural vitamins and nutraceuticals
*  and sunlight and health.
*  And people just know they got to deal with the way it is
*  because we always get diseases.
*  We always get viruses. We always live with the idea.
*  We got to lock society out and go into our houses.
*  And this is a post industrial move.
*  That they're using to roll out these systems to keep us locked down our homes.
*  Right. And if you want to be cynical, this is where you step in and say,
*  the reason why they want us to be upset and they want the economy to be fucked
*  is because they hate the president and they want him out of office
*  and they want to regain power.
*  They want the Democrats.
*  What a remake of the American economy in the image of what they want.
*  They want to remake a lot of these these systems that they feel are,
*  for whatever reason,
*  the just the in just or unjust or whatever.
*  And they want to use this opportunity to kind of redraw the lines.
*  Exactly. That after 9-11.
*  Exactly. This is the new 9-11.
*  The UN and the Davos group all say this is the post industrial world.
*  The great reset.
*  I got a copy of it for right here.
*  And they say in these documents, we are going to reorganize society,
*  COVID is good to shut down the carbon. Carbon is bad.
*  We're going to end success. We're going to end prosperity.
*  We're going to track everybody.
*  We're going to control their lives all under the name of COVID.
*  They said all that.
*  They said we're going to end success. We're going to end prosperity.
*  Yeah. In the lockstep Rockefeller document, 2010, they say,
*  we'll have a viral release or a simulated one that creates total fear.
*  We'll bring up police state martial law available for someone to read.
*  Absolutely.
*  Wasn't there something called Agenda 21 or something where they were saying,
*  we want people living in cities. We don't want home ownership.
*  We compact cities. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And you were saying it earlier. They go, oh,
*  it's for the greater good that we don't have cars anymore.
*  It's for the greater good we have.
*  That's what I was saying. What I was doing was give playing devil's advocate.
*  You were quoting them. Yeah. What I was saying, there's a thing.
*  You said that, Joe, you believe in that?
*  I was saying that autonomous, I do believe in cars, too.
*  Autonomous vehicles are in the future,
*  at least likely to be safer than people just driving and texting.
*  Well, it's not safe given control of these corporations and robots
*  making ourselves obsolete. We need to build a pro human future.
*  Oh, I'm pro human.
*  But I know you are saying you're not a feller thing from 2010.
*  So it sounds a weird. So I'm pro.
*  I started and I was already looking this up, as you mentioned,
*  because I was going down my own little rabbit hole.
*  It says when I first started to find it, my first search just says
*  there's a small a large conspiracy has been built out of this small
*  grain of truth from this document from 2010. OK.
*  That's what it starts to say.
*  So I have a that snopes small grain of truth. Yeah.
*  So snopes is like God.
*  It's like, I don't think is it snopes that you go?
*  Let's focus on the grain of truth.
*  Who says it's a grain of truth?
*  Hold on. No, no.
*  It's Operation Lockstep.
*  And it says a global police state will be brought in from a pandemic
*  and there'll be worldwide martial law.
*  It actually says it in the document. OK.
*  It's like they always go like, oh, there's no hunter emails.
*  The emails are real. Right. I love that clock.
*  It is weird that they're saying TGT studios.
*  It is weird. There's a document.
*  OK. The Rockefeller Foundation Annual Report 2010.
*  I'll control F. What would you like me to look up?
*  Look up police state.
*  Look up. Just look at police state.
*  I forget the exact words.
*  I mean, you just get rid of yourself.
*  Control F police.
*  They came up. This is just one paper. That's it.
*  I mean, that's the whole PDF is it's like it's really, really long.
*  So when you control F police state, nothing.
*  OK. What else?
*  Uh, I mean, I've read it before. It says that.
*  So anybody can read it right now.
*  So you think they edited it? No, no.
*  It's I mean, I can't remember the exact word.
*  OK, well, let's look up pandemic. Look up pandemic.
*  Pandemic just means widely distributed epidemic means you actually say
*  four mentions of the word pandemic. OK.
*  All right. With no network to transfer critical infectious disease information
*  without open lines of communications, thousands more fall sick.
*  The new in quotes disease becomes an unchecked pandemic by the time
*  the the right expertise is brought to bear on the problem.
*  It's too late.
*  The disease has spread around the globe in a world of global trade and travel.
*  What's traded faster and travels furthest are the microbes in every handshake.
*  Southeast. So what are they?
*  What is this in reference to?
*  OK, it says a few miles east.
*  Young boy has been.
*  And hold on. Don't please go back to that.
*  Yeah, just it's just it's just a scenario that they're painting.
*  So make that a little larger.
*  No, no, no. Go back to it.
*  Just go back to where it was. All right.
*  The potential pandemic in the past few decades have severely tested
*  the world's ability to work across human borders.
*  Detection remains weak in many parts of the world.
*  The public health response has frequently been slow and fragmented.
*  The looming threat of infectious disease presents humanity with a new challenge
*  to communicate and collaborate swifter and with greater efficiency than ever before.
*  That doesn't sound like they're trying to end the world.
*  OK, well, you're just reading one one of these documents.
*  I already I can pull up the articles I can show to you.
*  So it's world government controlled.
*  They talk about a worldwide police state.
*  You search the term pandemic.
*  I'm telling you what's in these things.
*  OK, emerging pandemics, the new century, SARS, avian flu and swine flu.
*  If we don't move, investigated systems to bring in global government.
*  It's like they're trying to prevent pandemics.
*  If they don't move quickly, viruses will.
*  By continuing our drive to invest in systems that coordinate efforts and share information,
*  the Rockefeller Foundation is working to get which is the global government
*  controlling all of us to meet the health challenges of an interconnected world.
*  Isn't the perfect analogy terrorism?
*  Because it's like terrorism exists.
*  People want to prevent terrorism.
*  But it's like, how many rights do you give up in order to do that?
*  And then, you know, all these proactive measures that we take to prevent terrorism,
*  a lot of them create more terrorists.
*  I think it's like a balance of like remaining a free society and dealing with a lot of these problems.
*  Listen, I sit here, you know, we sit here and we talk about something
*  and whether Jamie can find it or not becomes the arbiter whether it's real.
*  So they found something about AT&T lobbying.
*  They didn't find the thing about this.
*  I've got the Operation Lockstep documents where they say we're going to bring in this global
*  authoritarian police state.
*  OK, but you have to then you have to show us those.
*  Well, I mean, I'm sitting here in studio.
*  I'm sitting here in studio talking to you about this, but I understand.
*  I understand what you're saying, but we we want to try to, you know, everybody else watching
*  this is going to look it up.
*  Well, I hope they do.
*  They're going to go crazy.
*  I hope we wish we could have found it right then if it's real.
*  No, no, no, no, you want to show it.
*  But it might be an interpretation of what they're saying, like the Whitmer.
*  Now it says specifically the Whitmer quote is just a criticism of Trump.
*  She's blaming all this lockdown.
*  Whitmer was found by the by the Supreme Court of Michigan and by a federal court
*  to have seized all three branches of governments and basically set up martial
*  law. They even use those terms.
*  And she was overturned.
*  Say in that quote, I want to when you say if you are sick of lockdowns
*  and you're sick of not being able to go to church, Joe Biden should be elected.
*  Agree. That is not a huge jump from what he said.
*  No, it's not a huge jump.
*  But the problem is the way it's being said, she was talking about how bad
*  Trump handled the the rate of infection.
*  Of course. And that's all.
*  Let's expand on that.
*  I remember like interviewing Lou Dobbs like 15 years ago.
*  Back when he was still on CNN, we were looking at documents
*  where it said we're going to bring in global government, the North American Union
*  using the threat of viruses and migration flows and economic collapse.
*  And they said like a deadly flu or a deadly SARS.
*  Yeah, I'm sitting here watching this power grab, watching the UN
*  and and and and big tech saying, well, you can't say
*  that that the UN is wrong because the UN is in charge.
*  Since when is the news WHO and all these doctors,
*  all these medical doctors that come out and say other things
*  other than like how steroids cured it or, you know, how hydroxychloroquine
*  helped it, how are they being banned?
*  Even if they were wrong, they should be have their license removed.
*  That's what that's about.
*  It's not Google decides that if something isn't the UN, it's taken down.
*  That's all I'm saying.
*  Well, it is a problem that they're deciding which doctors to listen to
*  and which doctors not to when there is some real controversy
*  as to how to handle the virus virus with treatment.
*  Right. What treatment is effective and what isn't effective.
*  Now, it turns out there's a lot of doctors that think that hydroxychloroquine
*  isn't effective.
*  There's a lot of there's some doctors that thought it was.
*  And they think that a combination of zinc and hydroxychloroquine.
*  But the problem is the people that are deciding what gets taken down or not.
*  That's a huge problem.
*  And the problem is that the doctors who go, well, we think, you know, it's like
*  there's we've minimized the voices of the people that are saying one thing.
*  And we've elevated the voices of the people that are saying another thing.
*  And it's like that becomes the real issue.
*  What other people like Trump?
*  There's there's stuff to criticize about Trump.
*  We all know that.
*  And then there. But in their defense, they're doing it because they think
*  that people are going to do something foolish.
*  They're going to go out and spread the virus further because it's not the media's
*  job, though, to this is the problem.
*  I think the media has taken on this really activist role where they are now.
*  They're worse. It's not the media.
*  Yeah. Social media.
*  So some media companies, not not even necessarily the media.
*  Well, you have like legitimate journalists that are taking on this role.
*  Do you think he would do something in a second term about social media?
*  I think he certainly is going to do something.
*  Why hasn't he done something already?
*  Because it's so complex because they'll claim a selection meddling,
*  even though they're doing that at the same time.
*  What we have is multinational corporations acting in tandem
*  that are already making the nation state obsolete.
*  They're creating a information warfare monopoly,
*  and they're censoring people and using that power they have.
*  And we just sit here denying it's going on until it's too late.
*  I mean, it's a really serious situation.
*  And it is. It is a crazy situation where all of these tech companies
*  all lean left, all of them.
*  Yeah, they do. They lean left and they support like there's
*  there's no tech companies are out there supporting Donald Trump.
*  There's no tech company.
*  What's very interesting is tech companies are very wealthy people, right?
*  They're insanely wealthy.
*  But David Pakman had a really good point about that, that they like
*  when it comes to their financial dealings, they they're very conservative.
*  Very libertarian and conservative.
*  Oh, they don't pay taxes. Right.
*  I mean, Google pays almost taxes.
*  What I'm telling you, does Apple complain about Chinese slave factories in China?
*  No, it's just what I'm telling you is it's all BS.
*  And when you study what they're doing, I consider my phone and pull it up.
*  They talk about in lockstep bringing in a global authoritarian system.
*  They talk about riots.
*  They talk about war.
*  If you can find that article, there are.
*  Listen, Jamie, I found something.
*  But I don't I'm trying to understand what it's saying because it's now
*  it's like it's speaking about years in the future as though they've already happened.
*  Well, we're not too far away.
*  Let's see. Because like they're painting another scenario,
*  just like they painted with that infection scenario.
*  Archive.org I found.
*  I went to the second page of this link, but this is like scenario narratives.
*  It says lockstep.
*  It talks about pandemics from 2012 and the SARS and all sorts of H1N1.
*  So I skipped into the next page just to while you guys are talking.
*  And this is the part that that's a little strange, which is getting into what I think he is now.
*  Where is that? Can you highlight it?
*  It started here because it says about Kenya in 2025 and people being weary of top down.
*  OK, by 2025, people seem to be growing weary of so much top down control
*  and letting leaders and authorities make choices for them.
*  Whatever net wherever national interest clashed with individual interest,
*  there was conflict.
*  Sporadic pushback becomes increasingly organized and coordinated
*  as disaffected youth and people who have seen their status and opportunities slip away,
*  largely in developing countries, incited civil unrest.
*  By 2026, protesters in Nigeria brought down the government,
*  fed up with the entrenched cronyism and corruption.
*  Even those who'd like the greater stability and predictability of this world
*  began to grow uncomfortable and constrained by so many tight rules
*  and by the strictness of national boundaries.
*  The feeling lingered that sooner or later something would inevitably upset
*  the neat order that the world's governments had worked so hard to establish.
*  OK, I never read that, but that's the other stuff.
*  It's in there. I'm telling you, it's thousands of pages, man.
*  OK, it talks about global police state and worldwide riots.
*  And I mean, we're not that far away.
*  There's people are saying they're writing that they're writing it almost like I
*  I've never seen that part.
*  It's like it's but they're saying it says stuff like that.
*  Listen, look at ideas like the EU, right?
*  It's a supranational financial architecture.
*  People are saying that borders are racist.
*  People are saying that the idea of America is racist, the country is, you know,
*  is the idea of a country or a nation state is racist.
*  There is this growing
*  idea or ideology that global governance is a good thing
*  or that nation states are, you know, exclusionary.
*  Well, it comes down to this.
*  It's not that nation states are perfect.
*  Multinational corporations are bigger and operate, in many cases,
*  more powerfully than governments. Correct.
*  Yeah. And so they want control and they say they want control.
*  And they're going to use racial differences between two countries
*  to play them off against each other.
*  And they're going to use global crises to centralize global control.
*  And that's what they say in these white papers is the corporations
*  are using this for global control and there will be rebellions against it.
*  That's what I read. And then people have more loyalty
*  to multinational corporations and more loyalty.
*  They have more in common with people that live in London or Davos or Switzerland
*  than they do to their American citizens.
*  And that that becomes the problem.
*  You've got Google and Facebook executives on jumbo jets and mansions
*  telling us we've got to lower our carbon footprint and be poor.
*  They're hypocrites. It doesn't hold water. Yeah.
*  How do we get out? There it is.
*  Authoritarian capitalism.
*  I mean, I remember I don't have it in front of me, but I was reading
*  the lockstep Rockefeller documents and they predicted worldwide police state.
*  Authoritarianism, civil war.
*  They're predicting in 2018 says, will Africa embrace
*  where Africa's embrace of authoritarian capitalism, a la China continue?
*  And then Vietnam to require a solar panel at every home in 2022.
*  And then in 2025, it's not the same documents I saw.
*  But that's the question is, it's weird the way they're writing this.
*  They're they're writing this is that they're predicting.
*  Yeah. Well, they're they're talking about it like they're
*  they're seeing the future and like almost like it's fiction.
*  But they're talking about it like it's here's Trump saying,
*  we're not going to control the pandemic.
*  You don't you get used to it. You get over it.
*  You fight it with nutraceuticals.
*  You fight it with, you know, with with therapeutics.
*  It's the idea that Bill Gates came out two weeks ago and he goes,
*  we'll be shut down for 10 years. Is that what he said?
*  He said, yeah.
*  He said this goes on for 10 years until there's not one corona case.
*  Well, they picked the perfect the perfect problem.
*  They can never do that.
*  Crazy. Like you see a guy like Jamie who literally kicked it in a day.
*  And they're saying we're going to close down the world for 10 days.
*  Well, it's like the war on terror is still going on.
*  I mean, yeah, they want to be exactly.
*  They want a problem that never goes away.
*  Yeah, it's never going to. I mean, the Cold War went on forever.
*  I mean, this is just they like these things.
*  So we've entered into three hours in here, two and a half hours in here.
*  We've entered into this weird spot.
*  We're like, OK, what could be where you're going to drink whiskey? Yeah.
*  All right. I've already been about an election night. I'm here.
*  What could be done?
*  What can be done?
*  Man, all I know is I try to tell the truth.
*  I make mistakes, but I'm sitting here with these notes.
*  I've written where I read what globalists say.
*  I gave you that Wall Street Journal article.
*  They go, we're in we're impure that we can get sick.
*  It's time to get rid of all humans and merge with machines.
*  It's so beautiful. I think, well, that's just one cook.
*  And then it's almost all these people.
*  And really, there's trying to convince the public to all roll over and die.
*  But wait a minute.
*  Isn't that a provocative article by a journalist who's trying to paint
*  a rosy picture of our symbiotic relationship with technology?
*  I mean, when someone's saying, like, I mean, literally saying,
*  looking forward to the end of humanity, that's it's a provocative article.
*  It's like, but that's the nihilistic attitude these people actually pick up.
*  I mean, yes, it is.
*  But it's also sort of this inevitable if you extrapolate from where we are now
*  with technology to where we're going to be in 2030 years.
*  And when you look at things like Neuralink and you look at a lot of this
*  technology that they're they're coming up with.
*  But we're talking about big tech censoring us.
*  I don't want to plugged into my goddamn brain.
*  Yeah, it's probably a bad idea.
*  It seems like a bad idea to have them invade your body.
*  Well, when you're talking about centralized power like that, it is a bad.
*  It's not a good idea.
*  It's a bad idea to give them all I'm saying is, Joe, and I'm glad you're here.
*  I'm glad you're here.
*  I'm very excited to be here tonight.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  We have to get people to debate the fact that there's people, engineers
*  and technocrats choosing their course and that the public is not involved
*  in deciding that course.
*  I hope people are starting to understand when you see the White House
*  press secretary get banned from Twitter, when you see the New York Post links
*  get banned from Twitter, I hope people are starting to understand that
*  giving people power, giving large groups power over
*  whether it's national discourse, whether it's policy, any of these these things.
*  It's bad. It's a bad idea.
*  It's a bad idea. Exactly.
*  You don't want to give Alex Jones power.
*  The founding fathers, although they didn't predict technology,
*  they didn't predict the Internet, they did predict what happens
*  when you give human beings ultimate power. Right.
*  I mean, power corrupts.
*  Absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. Yeah.
*  So, so, Joe, you just said it.
*  So let me ask this question.
*  See, you got a huge audience.
*  We can really change the world right now.
*  We've got a good no one's listening.
*  No, they're listening.
*  There's no one.
*  If you want to change the world, you go on a listen.
*  Milano show. That's the show.
*  Yeah, dude. No, no.
*  I only get three times as many listeners.
*  People that are zombies don't don't matter.
*  I'm sorry about me. I mean,
*  I'm sure she won't take zombie.
*  Let me tell you, I don't think zombies.
*  You got to share what I said.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Listen, you can look at Tony Podesta or John Podesta
*  and laugh at them. They run the Democratic Party.
*  It came out two months ago in the New York Times bragging
*  that they were in the meeting when they were wargaming on thousands
*  of people listening on a telephone call.
*  They go, we're not going to concede and we're going to have the country.
*  Break up and we're going to have secession
*  and we're going to call for the UN to invade America.
*  How fucked up would it be if you all this stuff actually comes true?
*  The way this happens, this will be fucking insane.
*  I have to use it. Yeah, good.
*  But when people are talking about be careful with that that camera,
*  don't bump that camera.
*  But I'm not saying it's going to happen.
*  I'm saying they're saying it because if it doesn't happen,
*  I'll be glad. They're like, oh, you know, Jones is saying this is happening.
*  No, I know you will be glad.
*  Literally saying this does happen.
*  This like this podcast can be heavily criticized, right?
*  We are aware of this.
*  But when we knew that coming in, but when this goes down,
*  if this goes down the way you're describing it, how eerie would this be?
*  Well, I don't. It would be very eerie, eerie, very scary because I'll tell you,
*  like, this is what they're saying they're going to do.
*  Now, I hope they don't do it.
*  But they are saying that they're going to contest the election when they lose.
*  And if Trump tries to declare it, big tech is implemented.
*  This AI system that's going to block hundreds of millions of Americans
*  from being able to say.
*  Trump won election night.
*  Yeah. And so that's why election night is so spectacular.
*  And some people can say, well, there's never been voter fraud before.
*  A voter fraud has been so minuscule in the past.
*  That is true.
*  But however, the ability to vote by mail in advance
*  never really existed like it exists.
*  Exactly. 80 million ballots put out there.
*  80 million ballots put out there as a total wild card.
*  So who is counting all these ballots?
*  It's the locales, it's whoever grabs them, it's whoever puts in the false names.
*  There's been a bunch of people arrested.
*  Right. But if you're say, if you're in a democratically controlled state
*  and you so who is controlling and counting those those ballots?
*  Brian Redman, he's a good guy.
*  He'll tell us the truth.
*  Brian, get over here real quick.
*  He's over two minutes.
*  OK, we need Brian.
*  No, I mean, seriously, I don't know what's going to happen, Joe.
*  I know the Democrat chief strategist says we're going to contest the election.
*  We're going to break the country up like Civil War 1862.
*  And we're going to do all this.
*  And we're going to say that, go ahead.
*  They found water on the moon. Oh, awesome.
*  They did find water on the moon.
*  You know, six months before they said that, Buzz Aldrin called me up.
*  He said there's water on the moon and he goes, we're going to crash it in in probe
*  in there. It's like not, you know, 2007 or something.
*  They're going to crash it in in probe on the moon.
*  I want you to know, we already crashed one.
*  They're going to find the water.
*  I was like, thank you, Buzz Aldrin.
*  So he called you up.
*  Yep. Does Buzz call you often?
*  No, he's called me like three times.
*  Are you ever shocked?
*  No, he's called me like three times.
*  Are you ever shocked? Are you like he's like it's Alex's.
*  Actually got like 20 million views for the tune of YouTube.
*  He was on the show one time.
*  He goes, my secretary really likes you.
*  Oh, you're hot. You're lucky. I'm doing this.
*  I'm like, well, yes, sir.
*  He goes, there is the moon of Mars that is where the real obelisk is.
*  2001. The aliens created the pyramids.
*  And I just wanted to tell you, Alex, you got to what?
*  He said the aliens created the pyramids.
*  Yeah. And there was an obelisk.
*  I heard that. That's not shocking.
*  The buzz. Buzz Aldrin said the aliens created the pyramids.
*  Yeah, I'm telling you, I was contacted by Buzz Aldrin's secretary.
*  And I'm picking this up.
*  This is where I don't believe you are.
*  And it's just like whatever this was like 12 years ago, whatever.
*  Ten years ago, whatever it was.
*  Hey, Buzz Aldrin wants to come on.
*  So we checked his buzz Aldrin. He wants to talk about his new book.
*  But once he gets on, he goes, it is the sole moon Choron or whatever it's called.
*  Look up the moon of moon of I'm off memory.
*  And so I get this stuff wrong.
*  So that's of Mars.
*  He goes, that is where the true obelisk is.
*  And that will give us the data tapes to go to the next level.
*  And I just wanted you to know that because you're a good person.
*  That the pyramids were created by aliens and we're doing important work.
*  There is buzz Aldrin admits aliens built the pyramids and Phobos monument.
*  Oh, the the.
*  He said that he talked to me on C-SPAN.
*  Yeah. And so he said he said aliens built the pyramids.
*  I swear to God, this guy really went off the reservation.
*  Like you think NASA is like doing a better vetting process now because this guy really,
*  you know, he's had tough times.
*  Well, he just endorsed Trump. Oh, did he?
*  Why did he endorse Trump?
*  All the military endorsed Trump, all the police.
*  But listen, I'm not bragging.
*  I don't know why.
*  I thought he had one about a book he wrote.
*  He starts telling me about aliens, the pyramids and the friggin.
*  Let me ask you this.
*  What did you think about the Pentagon saying recently that they've recovered crafts
*  that are not of this world?
*  I think it's probably true.
*  I think it's probably true as well.
*  I think we're like the ditch, like a movie theater.
*  But I talked to stuff of the ditch.
*  Yeah. When I talked to Commander Fravor,
*  who is the guy who saw that the Tic Tac UFO off the coast of San Diego,
*  the way he describes it in the video footage of the gut of this thing.
*  And his his take on it is fucking chilling.
*  That thing went from 60,000 feet above Tic Tac.
*  OK, yeah, it looks like a Tic Tac.
*  Well, that's Joe's new code name was Tic Tac.
*  It's a Tic Tac. You know what?
*  Yeah, it's a huge problem.
*  No, it's just a little Tic Tac.
*  They're jaywalking in the house. What do you say about it?
*  Yeah, he said that this thing went from 60,000 feet above sea level to one
*  inside of a second.
*  I said it defied propulsion by any
*  but any understanding that we have of physics.
*  The way it moved was insane.
*  It was actively blocking tracking systems, which is an act of war.
*  That's not that I do. They block all the radar.
*  You could listen to him on my podcast, but I would actually recommend
*  you listen to him on Lex Friedman's podcast.
*  It's available on YouTube.
*  And Lex does an amazing job of talking to him and breaking down.
*  Let's do that. Joe, what do you think the universe is?
*  What do you think? Let's talk real.
*  What's the secret universe?
*  Totally legit report says Buzz Aldrin saw aliens when he was up in space.
*  Sarcasm. Oh, well, that's not Joe.
*  Is that you in the photo?
*  They said that he tried.
*  I don't think that somebody reached out to his people
*  and they said that it's bogus and we don't know where it came from.
*  It's bogus. We don't know where he came on my show and said that
*  the pyramid thing, the pyramid quote, he says bogus.
*  Well, maybe they pulled him aside.
*  Let's have fun here.
*  Everybody's watching this epic podcast.
*  It's part three. Joe Rogan.
*  I want to know.
*  So what is what do you think runs the universe?
*  What do you think the secret is? Who are the DMT elves?
*  When's the last time you took DMT?
*  It's been a couple of years.
*  I don't think that there is any doubt that there's other life out there.
*  It's a matter of if it contacts us regularly,
*  whether or not it's contacted us or why it comes and why visits or Jacques
*  Vallee, I believe.
*  I think his perception is not that they're from another planet,
*  but that that would be probably the least spectacular answer
*  and that they could be interdimensional travelers.
*  Some people believe that their time and Jacques Vallee is the guy who Steven
*  Spielberg, he modeled that French scientist in Close Encounters
*  of the Third Kind after him.
*  He's a really, really interesting guy.
*  And that's what I personally believe is interdimensional.
*  It could be that it could be that
*  our understanding of reality itself is very limited.
*  It's like, you know, if you wave your hand above certain insects,
*  they have no idea you're even there, right?
*  They lack the ability to detect it.
*  We have senses that we assume are the only senses that are available.
*  And it is entirely likely that there are many dimensions
*  that we don't have access to. Right.
*  And this is the quantum physicists and all those guys that write the shit
*  on yellow legal pads that you don't understand.
*  They all believe there's many, many dimensions.
*  There's no doubt to that.
*  I agree with you. I agree with you.
*  I think the universe is insanely huge.
*  And they're finding life compatible planets on a daily basis.
*  There's hundreds of them now.
*  So I agree with you.
*  Let me ask this question.
*  And what do we do about this corrupt political elite
*  trying to make us look at them and follow them?
*  How do we break free of them?
*  That's a different thing of the universe.
*  But my question is, like, why are they telling us now
*  that they've acquired these ships or that they they they have
*  access to these things or that they know these things are real?
*  You know, Bob Lazar has basically been describing
*  exactly that and exactly the same way since 1989,
*  when when he was first hiding
*  when he was on George Knapp's television show in Vegas.
*  And they had him only as a silhouette.
*  And then he eventually came out and said that he was a propulsion expert
*  that was brought to area S4.
*  And they've tried to discredit him and they've tried to talk.
*  But one of the things that he said was he talked about element 115
*  and that this was something that they used to propel these crafts.
*  And it was something that it can it could change gravity,
*  can bend gravity and propel itself in a way that is not like any propulsion
*  system that we use now, which essentially you have to push something out
*  the back to make it go forward, whether it's flames or, you know, a rocket
*  or anything else, like even an airplane.
*  Right. It propels things forward.
*  And what he was saying is that what this element 115 is allowing them to do
*  is to somehow or another bend space and time, some another bend gravity.
*  They don't. But they don't know how it works.
*  They don't know what what it's doing.
*  Well, let's talk about this operates on this element.
*  Let's talk about this. Hold on.
*  They know it operates on this element.
*  There was only theoretical until I think it was 2013 or 2015.
*  They used a particle collider and they they they detected it
*  in an actual element 115 that it was actually real.
*  And that's what the superconducting super colliders are for.
*  Well, I mean, they're there for detecting many things.
*  Cyclotrons. Well, these particle colliders are for detecting
*  many different things that are theoretical and they find these things to be true.
*  And then it becomes, you know, scientific record.
*  What I think is that we are apes.
*  We are these weird talking apes that are in an adolescent stage
*  of technological evolution.
*  And what we might be looking at when we see these these
*  tic tac UFOs and other things, we might be looking at something from the future.
*  We might be looking at time travelers.
*  We might might be looking at something that comes back.
*  And, you know, I think that's I think that's a good approximation.
*  But we're a little bit beyond just apes.
*  Clearly, we're from outside the planet and there's something bigger going on.
*  Like this this life forms happen before.
*  This is a major test.
*  And so we can sit there and just say, oh, we're just apes.
*  No, I don't mean that.
*  What I mean by we're just apes is that in comparison to what we could be
*  eventually through revolution, you're saying we're in a metamorphosis.
*  Well, we're we're we're on a look.
*  We're a lot smarter than apes, right, than regular apes that are in most of us
*  in in the zoo or in some of the public's dumber than I was about to say.
*  Some of them are dumber paint with a broad brush.
*  But we are nowhere near where our potential lies, right?
*  Our potential lies far, far, far in advance of what we are currently.
*  And I think some of this has to do with some of these symbiotic technologies
*  that we're talking about, like Neuralink and a lot of these things
*  that are being proposed that are eventually going to find their way
*  into the human body and accelerate.
*  But are they going to censor our ability?
*  Are they going to censor our ability?
*  Well, because we're already growing.
*  And all I see from big tech is censorship.
*  So is the Neuralink going to censor what I did?
*  Well, the little plug in and make me feel great and hit my pleasure center.
*  Well, when you're talking about human emotions and greed and power
*  and all these different things, these are all biological issues that we have
*  that the idea is will be transcended.
*  If you could somehow believe the big tech lords aren't like us, they're they're us, though.
*  So they're in charge of the same thing that we already are.
*  So to say, oh, big tech lords are going to take us away from our human problem.
*  Right. But do you understand?
*  Sin, they're going to make it worse.
*  OK. But do you understand that they didn't understand
*  what technology was going to create when it created the Internet?
*  The the ability to distribute information, the ability to distribute
*  information that existed pre 1990, whatever, when the Internet became mainstream.
*  It was very, very, very different than it is today.
*  And it's very hard to get away with the things you get away with in the early 1980s.
*  What they what they can do now in terms of a regular person
*  and their ability to transmit information, access information.
*  It's all I'm saying is the controllers and giant leaps.
*  I get it. The technology is there.
*  I'm not against the technology.
*  It's those that reduce it to us and they control how it's deployed.
*  Understand. That's the big issue.
*  But everything is about that.
*  What I was trying to get to is the way information has gotten out of their hands
*  and you can distribute it in a way that they never anticipated.
*  If they did anticipate it, I guarantee they would never let the Internet.
*  No, I agree. I used to think that same thing is going to happen with all other technologies.
*  And if that's the case, technology may be our only hope.
*  Technology may be the only thing that saves us from all these human emotions,
*  the need for power and greed and control.
*  The one thing that might save us from that is the symbiotic relationship with technology
*  where we connect to things that will alleviate a lot of the problems of Joe.
*  If that technology I'm not saying this is good or bad.
*  Say you're wrong. Can I say something? Yeah.
*  You're doing really good.
*  This is great rants.
*  That's your own than I've ever seen.
*  I'm not being patronizing. It's good stuff.
*  It's OK. You're drunk.
*  No, no, I'm saying this is powerful.
*  Be nice. Be nice.
*  What I'm saying is there's outside groups trying to program that.
*  So you can't project your own goodness onto that.
*  Not saying even goodness.
*  I'm saying no.
*  What I'm saying is you've been ranting for five minutes and I'm just what you say.
*  I get what you're saying.
*  It's just that you're sitting there saying this will free us
*  from our problems, but it's still humans that program the nexus points of it.
*  So it could actually amplify the problems.
*  I say we should be wary of all of it.
*  Oh, it certainly could.
*  Look, it could go sideways.
*  It could all go bad.
*  But it also could go to a point where people don't feel the need to do that anymore.
*  And that we recognize that a lot of what we have is
*  we are escaping the shackles of our monkey.
*  Oh, if we're our monkey bodies.
*  So if we're silicon and don't need resources anymore,
*  we can just be spiritual and then we'll be able to free ourselves
*  and not hurt the earth anymore.
*  Hop in that tic tac and fly to Alpha Centauri in the blink of an eye.
*  So we need it. We need to.
*  No, I already see the transmission.
*  If you could have a spaceship that would allow you to go anywhere in the galaxy,
*  would you be willing to give up any of your emotions for that?
*  No, I know that I know that I know the digital deal.
*  Give up your body for the silicon gods and become a god.
*  This is all fun and games, but like, you know, not even I mean,
*  California, we're not even allowed to go to Applebee's.
*  So let's stop with the spaceship.
*  Let's just try to get I'm not allowed to leave my fucking house.
*  I want to go to the comedy store.
*  Yeah. I mean, we'll get a spaceship eventually.
*  Let's get a few rides.
*  I got your thing. I'm coming to election night.
*  You're going to be.
*  Election night election.
*  Ratings, 25 billion viewers.
*  And you invited yourself to this.
*  I think you should settle down.
*  Alien. You told me I'm coming.
*  No, you invited yourself.
*  We already got it.
*  It's not coming.
*  No, I said you could come in for a little bit, but you're you're making it
*  the Alex Jones show. No, I'm not.
*  It's a bit of an issue.
*  This is like the elections.
*  There's an issue. Apple did have an issue.
*  Settle down. It's a bit of an issue.
*  It's going to be a fun, fun experience.
*  It'll be a lot of fun.
*  But what big so mean you you literally might be.
*  No, I think Joe wants to beat my ass right now.
*  I don't listen, Alex. I love you.
*  But what I'm saying, and I'm not even disagreeing with you.
*  I'm saying that I think when we're talking about aliens
*  and we're talking about life forms from out of space and space travel and shit.
*  The big, the big issues of the election.
*  You see those fucking things like the Easter bunnies.
*  They all have big heads.
*  Yeah, the great little tiny muscle is body.
*  Shaved heads, shaved heads.
*  Yeah. They've all escaped.
*  They've escaped all of the you're actually an alien.
*  Make us they look like what we're going to be.
*  Yeah. But who wants to be that?
*  I don't want to be there right now.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  No, I'm with you.
*  I like being a person. Right.
*  I think we should be humans for as long as we can.
*  What do you think aliens are?
*  There are all sorts of interdimensional forces in the universe and multidimension.
*  So there's like bad aliens that are trying to manipulate our development.
*  Because a high level, exactly.
*  A high level would not try to manipulate our development.
*  Right. OK, so so Joe is like imprinting on these demons because he loves them.
*  He's a bad person.
*  No, no, seriously.
*  So all I'm saying is, is we need to build towards the next level and do amazing things.
*  What do you think of the what do you think?
*  And I did invite myself on the election show.
*  I it's going to be great. I got on my news in front of Joe.
*  I'll do it again right now.
*  What do you get on my knees?
*  Stop making it about you.
*  No, it is about me.
*  I'm in front of your drunk.
*  I want to come on. Yes.
*  Ban you from alcohol.
*  What I want. You're going to smoke weed with me.
*  What do you think about?
*  We're going to have a party.
*  We do that in two minutes.
*  What do you think?
*  The highest rate.
*  What do you think about the theory that human beings are the product of accelerated
*  evolution, that they came down here and they genetically manipulated lower hominids
*  and they created human beings?
*  Listen, I already have a genetic memory.
*  I already told you all this.
*  I mean, I already have a genetic memory.
*  Yes, that's epigenetics.
*  Yeah. OK.
*  So I have a genetic.
*  You have a genetic memory. Right.
*  I have a genetic memory and I have a genetic memory that weren't, you know,
*  I have a bunch of memories.
*  Take you to watch Star Wars.
*  Like, I've done this before. This looks totally normal.
*  We're in the universe. We're in the planets.
*  We're here.
*  Our life's forms have been all over the place, like little seeds that jump from planet
*  to planet, like blowing to the space winds.
*  So, yeah, we've already been here before.
*  Because this is one of the things that Lazar brought up that they discussed with him
*  at Area S4. They said that they believe that human beings are the product of accelerated
*  evolution. It's like and he wasn't sure if they were fucking with him.
*  Like when he was reading all that stuff, he's like, is this like disinformation?
*  No, they weren't fucking with him.
*  Yeah, I mean, yeah, but.
*  God doesn't know where God came from.
*  Well, and we said that last time, that's heavy.
*  And we don't know where we came from. Right.
*  But we have the archetypal memories that go so far.
*  And then our big fear is have an evolutionary death of the species.
*  It's like a line of, you know, flowers or plants or, you know, whatever we are.
*  And it's a whole genetic experience.
*  We're conscious individuals, but then we have a genetic experience
*  that goes on forever, as long as the life of the genetic experience doesn't die.
*  So we're always looking for eternal life.
*  As long as we keep having kids, they have kids. We live forever.
*  That's us. We just get better.
*  Well, as long as the earth doesn't experience a massive extinction event.
*  But that's what I'm saying. Well, if we go interplanetary.
*  That's well, so the main mission of the third
*  79 days of chaos and I am endorsing Joe Biden right now.
*  I'm voting for.
*  By the way, that might be a good strategy if you endorse Joe Biden right now.
*  I'm going to go with my history of voting for people that have been on the podcast.
*  So I'm going to vote for Kanye.
*  I'm going with Joe Jorgensen because I like the back of winner.
*  Am I sitting in the same seat as Kanye? Yes, you are.
*  All right. I'm fulfilled.
*  That's the best. All right.
*  But before this goes any further off the rails, I think we're good.
*  We've done it. Oh, you want to end this transmission? Do you?
*  I never got to all my notes.
*  You got more shit.
*  You got what else would you like to talk about?
*  I got more shit than you can fucking imagine here.
*  You got to come back.
*  You got to come back November 3rd.
*  You got to have nice wheel in those documents.
*  Just wheel in documents.
*  Joe said he's like, you're the one to divide yourself.
*  November 3rd. You're coming.
*  You certainly did.
*  I waited like you invited yourself 19 months or something.
*  That was fine.
*  If I showed you the list of people that are trying to get on this fucking show,
*  it would make your head spin.
*  I know, but I live down the street. I understand.
*  I don't care. You don't want me 30 minutes on election night.
*  We're going to be fine. We're going to be fine.
*  But I'm just saying, I don't know how to survive without it.
*  It's very difficult for me to manage a fucking small fraction of the number of
*  people that are trying to get on.
*  Well, this is an epic podcast.
*  Yeah, we got to go another hour.
*  It is. It is.
*  That will be dead.
*  I'm going to go in another hour.
*  This is going to be bigger than the Elon Musk.
*  That's the I'm a second.
*  Have to be my second biggest podcast.
*  You can't be competitive.
*  Every listener has to spread this link right now or I'm going to die.
*  Well, you two.
*  No, I wrote notes for you.
*  Let me read these notes to you.
*  Yes, please do. Please.
*  OK. OK. What's important?
*  Major goals to accomplish
*  how the president could invoke martial law.
*  You handed this to me. I don't even know.
*  He does like a magic trick.
*  Yeah.
*  And this is how the president remember getting here.
*  I don't remember me.
*  These are big, important topics.
*  Do you drive around with this just in the car?
*  No, he's actually done research to prepare for this show.
*  I know a lot of research.
*  And then I was like, I'm not going to drink.
*  I'm going to be good.
*  We're already here.
*  We're talking about heavy.
*  I wish this was six days from now, so I could be.
*  How many hours are we into this?
*  With three hours in with three.
*  Yeah. If we don't break the last record, we're going to.
*  What's the last record?
*  No, we don't have to break record.
*  No, Tim Dillon, you rant while I get ready.
*  Give us your latest comedy.
*  I love Joe. Like it's true.
*  I was like, literally, I mean, he's like a joke.
*  Can I please come under the election?
*  Listen, we're going to.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  And he like slap me.
*  He goes, we're good. He punched me in the nose.
*  He goes, I didn't do that.
*  And I groveled around that.
*  None of that happened.
*  But but tell me, go over, you know, Tim and I'll talk.
*  Is this everything that you hoped it would be?
*  This is my version of a make a wish kid going to Disney World.
*  This is the greatest thing I've ever done is to sit here.
*  I've watched Alex since I'm 13 years old,
*  pre 9 11 when he was ranting about the WTO.
*  And I followed him through 9 11 through Bohemian Grove,
*  all the big events of my childhood.
*  And just as big to be here.
*  Can I say I'm very impressed with your knowledge?
*  Like, you know, a lot of this stuff.
*  Well, I didn't go to college.
*  You have a lot of time.
*  A lot of time. If you don't go to college, you can.
*  I'm self educated. Yeah.
*  Well, yeah, there's a lot of information.
*  Yeah. Important stuff.
*  Disposal. Yeah. You got some notes?
*  I like how your new studio is like a colon.
*  Listen, this new studio came together in just a few weeks.
*  We really didn't know what I'm not putting it down.
*  Room. We banged it out real quick.
*  But this is going to be loaners, the colon.
*  The red people call it the red.
*  Yeah, that's a radio.
*  Oh, my God. This is the red pill.
*  He called it the red pill.
*  So this is a very rare studio.
*  You're you're getting a new one ready.
*  I know. Yeah, we're both we're having problems finding a good location.
*  But yeah, we'll have a my house.
*  I got a huge area.
*  We're going to find a good spot.
*  It's amazing. We're looking right now.
*  We're in the process. All right. Let's get serious. OK.
*  Oh, I covered a lot of this.
*  Alex, we're good, man. We're good.
*  No, we have to go for another two hours.
*  But we're going to see you again in a week.
*  Oh, so I am on the nightly.
*  Relax. Yeah, I have to beg.
*  I'm not just begging.
*  You don't act. Come on, man.
*  I'm not below bleeding.
*  Is there anything else you really want to discuss?
*  No, I mean, I'm glad that Jamie is better than I am at Search the Internet.
*  I'm not kissing his ass, but I'm really good at it.
*  He's better than I am, which is almost no one is.
*  He does it with one hand.
*  The problem is, I remember all this stuff.
*  Now, most of the time, it's accurate.
*  Sometimes it's not.
*  But I mean, if I'm saying something, I believe I saw it or I did it.
*  One thing that was in there, I didn't want to correct earlier, but
*  the year you were talking about something, you kept saying 1963.
*  And then they went to like 82 or whatever.
*  That happened in 73.
*  That group wasn't even around yet.
*  The the something to Rome club room.
*  Yeah, that was that wasn't even created until 68.
*  So just for clarification purposes. OK, cool.
*  I think they had a subgroup earlier than that.
*  Tim, I'm not saying you're wrong.
*  Yeah. Well, who knows?
*  But Jamie's I mean, he has George Soros, COVID.
*  This is a compromised individual.
*  Might have compromised the records.
*  Oh, that's another thing I want to say. Can I say? Yeah.
*  This is the most important thing we said tonight.
*  We said a lot of important things.
*  Both of you are not drinking.
*  Yes. So you don't know. Right.
*  But this is it right now. OK.
*  M.R.N.A. vaccines. Yeah.
*  So when you think about a regular vaccine goes in,
*  it's a broken bacteria, a broken virus.
*  It's defeated.
*  Your body learns how to kick its ass. It's like a dummy.
*  So I have an attack dog training on a dummy. Right.
*  The T.
*  Olympus site, white blood cell.
*  It's like a big badass Mike Tyson.
*  It learns how to defeat it.
*  M.R.N.A. vaccines go into your cells as a virus.
*  They're viruses.
*  So it's a virus they inject you with
*  that reprograms your cell to then have a certain response to things
*  and release proteins, which is what cancer does.
*  And so they admit on the news that 100 percent of people that take these
*  are getting sick.
*  Twenty percent are going to the hospital.
*  And so they also have vaccines that are called behavior modification vaccines.
*  You can type it in. OK. But let me pause right there.
*  M.R.N.A. vaccines.
*  You said 100 percent of them get sick and 20 percent of them go to the hospital.
*  They had two studies
*  in one study, 100 percent got sick, 20 percent with the hospital.
*  Another study, 80 percent got sick and of those 20 percent with the hospital.
*  That's CBS News.
*  You type in.
*  Jamie's going to find that right now.
*  You type in Bill Gates grilled over over vaccine dangers.
*  You'll have CBS News reporting.
*  But the point is they admit a bunch of vaccine deaths have happened now
*  from the test.
*  But what was that into before that?
*  So you were just talking about M.R.N.A.
*  Oh, behavioral. Yeah.
*  Behavioral modification.
*  Yeah. So type in vaccine to cure heroin addiction.
*  But we're going to get to that.
*  But before we get to that, we've got to Google the stats on M.R.N.A.
*  vaccines, because that this is going to be highly contested.
*  So we have to find out.
*  Well, no, you can type. I can share the clip. Bill Gates.
*  But we just Google the stats on M.R.N.A.
*  patients in trial.
*  I don't even I think they don't have the stats on that.
*  So how do you know it?
*  Bill Gates was on CBS News.
*  And he said 80 percent of the people get sick. Yeah.
*  And 20 percent of them go to the hospital.
*  No, it's two vaccines.
*  They said one vaccine, 100 percent got sick.
*  And a certain percent went to the hospital.
*  The other 80 percent got sick and 20 percent of those.
*  And sometimes that does happen even with the flu vaccine, right?
*  Like, sometimes people get.
*  I swear to God, you type in Bill Gates, grilled by CBS.
*  So bring it up. Right.
*  Certain vaccines do get people a little bit.
*  We had the conversation about the whole thing in India.
*  You know, he introduced a lot of vaccines in India.
*  There was some negative reactions to them.
*  I mean, that's what happens.
*  It's just, you know, a lot of Joe, I sent you the article.
*  That M.R.N.A. vaccines, I sent you the article about
*  AP about the majority of new
*  polio cases are the Bill Gates vaccine.
*  You know, we'll get to that, too.
*  Let me see if Jamie can find this M.R.N.A. thing.
*  You know, you don't have a Morton's next door here.
*  M.R.N.A.
*  I'm blotting out. I looked it up and I'm like, oh, yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm just fine. No more.
*  Yeah, I'll go.
*  I want to look at him.
*  He's making a point about vaccines and now we're at stake.
*  I am not hammered at all.
*  I've been drinking orange juice.
*  You polished off a half a bottle of orange juice.
*  A job just to have fun.
*  I'm happy you're here.
*  Legitimately.
*  So. If you can't find that, the behavioral modification,
*  what is it you want to find Bill Gates polio vaccine?
*  Causes of polio AP AP AP dot com.
*  The headline, the exact timeline is why does everybody hate Bill Gates?
*  What is going on? Because you're so sexy.
*  I I don't think people hate them.
*  No, it was like it was it was like AP.
*  You Bill Gates did not say 700000 people of negative side effects.
*  He did say that. My God, he said it on it.
*  He said it on NBC News.
*  Bill Gates did not say 700000 people of negative side effects
*  from a coronavirus vaccine.
*  I have the video that OK, but pull up AP Bill Gates polio vaccine.
*  But that's a coronavirus.
*  He said polio vaccine.
*  All right. OK, now I'm pissed.
*  I'm going to tell you the headline.
*  It was a we'll see if there's a polio.
*  Oh, no. What was that like?
*  Article. It was you in.
*  You in vaccine causes polio.
*  You and vaccine causes polio. OK.
*  You and vaccine causes polio.
*  Google, you know, this summer, October, Google is compromised.
*  Can you just ask Jesus, please?
*  UN says new polio outbreak in Sudan was caused by oral vaccine.
*  Yeah. Whoa. It's not good.
*  New polio outbreak in Sudan is caused by oral vaccine.
*  And this look at that kid's face.
*  Oh, my God. Is that a terrifying image?
*  The image of them distributing that look at that poor kid's face.
*  Imagine that kid getting polio from that vaccine.
*  There's he looks so terrified.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah. I mean, that's tragic.
*  Oh, and a bunch of them died.
*  But Jesus Christ, this Alex Jones.
*  Hold on. Hold on. Back up. Back up. Back up. Back up.
*  Was it say up there?
*  World Health Organization says a new polio
*  outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine sparked epidemic in Chad.
*  A week after the UN vaccine sparked epidemic,
*  the agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio vaccine.
*  World Health Organization said it found 11 additional vaccine derived polio
*  cases in Sudan and that the virus had been identified in environmental samples.
*  There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient.
*  The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water
*  and most often strikes children under five. Fuck.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine
*  can mutate in a form capable of sparking new outbreaks.
*  So let me tell you a story.
*  My grandmother died three years ago at 92.
*  Incredible woman. That's fucking terrible.
*  She was told by her doctor in 1954 when she got the second polio shot.
*  They said, sorry, it was live. It paralyzed her.
*  She was on crutches rest of her life. They told her it did to her.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So, see, I just told you that. Yeah, it's true.
*  And that's a whitewash what AP is doing.
*  I would imagine.
*  So I'm telling you, I make mistakes because I can't remember all this stuff.
*  I understand. You remember a lot.
*  But I'm not trying to lie.
*  I wish the last thing I want to say is this.
*  I'd like to retire the next year.
*  I'd like to finish up my work, clean up mistakes I made, talk about other stuff,
*  because I'm going to die of a heart attack or going crazy.
*  I'll do this 18 hours a day.
*  I like to get you in shape.
*  I'm totally stressed out, Joe. I'm dying. I know you are. I know.
*  I literally do this stuff constantly.
*  I read thousands of articles. I know you do.
*  If I text you at three o'clock in the morning, you respond right back.
*  You're wide awake.
*  I'm not a victim. I'm telling you, I'm dying. I understand.
*  So I can't do this much longer.
*  And I want everybody to know I love my crew.
*  But I told them I can't keep running this operation.
*  I just want to tell the truth and I want to get out in the next year.
*  Doesn't mean I won't go on your show once a year
*  and do like a write a book or something.
*  But I want you to get healthy.
*  I need to get healthy. I try to get healthy.
*  Why don't you hire a trainer and hire a dietician?
*  I try because I know you got off the booze for quite a while.
*  And we were talking. You said you felt great.
*  I did feel great. I lost 40 pounds.
*  How long did you get off the booze for?
*  Four months, no alcohol, about eight months and barely any.
*  And like the last three or four hours right back.
*  But you you you were talking to me about Adderall.
*  You're the problem.
*  You know, I want you to talk about that, because that's a good thing
*  for people to hear that the the problems that you had with Adderall,
*  because that that shit scares the fuck out of me.
*  Well, I'm not going to get into any of that type of stuff.
*  The point is, is that is that the things that doctors push,
*  the things that go on, the whole country is drugged up on a bunch of stuff.
*  Yeah. And it's it's it's it's not good.
*  But I'm not I do caffeine and alcohol.
*  That's it. And it's all very, very destructive.
*  And, you know, it gets to the point where like you're exhausted
*  unless you drink and it's not a good thing.
*  I'm glad you sober in October.
*  Last October, I was sober.
*  Yeah. Do you think you could just kick it totally?
*  I mean, you kicked it for four months.
*  Do you think if I wasn't doing a show every day and having to read,
*  I mean, I'm not exaggerating. I read.
*  50 articles, I probably scan 500.
*  I mean, I read so much stuff that it's it's enslaving me.
*  Like I I just want to.
*  I don't want to be around anymore.
*  It's not like I'm scared of it.
*  I'm just I want to be something else.
*  It's it's negative.
*  It has negative consequences in your health.
*  Yeah. So so for me, I just want to get away from all of it.
*  And what do you want to do?
*  I'd love to go hunting and fishing and relaxing and oil painting and doing sculpture.
*  I love metal sculpture.
*  I love that's a beautiful chimpanzee skull.
*  You're out there.
*  I mean, I just I've done this 26, 27 years.
*  And when you've done it that long, you want to stand the fight,
*  but at the same time, you want to not do it anymore.
*  And that's the thing about people, the Democrats suing me and attacking me.
*  Before Trump even got elected, I was already telling people,
*  I'm going to shut this company down.
*  I can't fund all of you. I can't do this anymore.
*  They're attacking me, made me keep fighting.
*  Did you think that if if you were healthier,
*  if you maybe just did less, you could be all right with it?
*  I didn't do that as a stunt.
*  I mean, quite honest with you, I'm a smart, I'm a smart.
*  I think I'm going to die of a heart attack at like 50 something.
*  I'm 47 now.
*  And I just I just have to like there's no way to do this full time.
*  Either you do it or you turn loose.
*  And I'd like to just for a few years just disappear.
*  So you think that the amount of shit that's out there and when
*  and this is a problem with conspiracies, right,
*  because you keep finding more and more and more that are provable.
*  And you start going crazy because you start really.
*  Exactly. And then you lose who you exactly like.
*  Yeah, I don't like the globalist. I'm not giving into them.
*  I'm giving into like my own body.
*  It's not like their attacks keep me fighting them.
*  Like they keep thinking like, oh, let's mess with him more.
*  He'll give up. That makes me like attack more.
*  It's I'm trying to like get him to top attacking me.
*  It's not some Machiavellian thing I'm saying.
*  I just want to like I don't want to be and I don't want to look at the news.
*  Maybe if he just took some time off and like just got healthy.
*  Maybe maybe maybe that's what you need.
*  Maybe you just need an extended vacation.
*  I mean, you're your own boss, right?
*  You could do that.
*  Do you ever think you maybe shrink the operation down a little bit
*  and then you could kind of do what you want, how you want,
*  you know, instead of instead of just being a 24 hour day operation,
*  you could just take it down.
*  Well, here's my problem.
*  We get personal.
*  I mean, I had perfect teeth to like two years ago.
*  I've wore a mouth brace because I literally crushed my teeth when I was asleep.
*  Like I broke one just the other day.
*  I got implants going in right here.
*  And I'm just like literally in my sleep, clenching my teeth so hard
*  that I've got like giant muscles like I'm not a swordsman.
*  But my jaws are right.
*  But they're like a chipmunk.
*  And it's because that psychologically, I'm trying to defeat all this.
*  And it's just like it's like a certain point in time, I can't do it all right.
*  So I don't feel sorry for myself.
*  You've earned it. You've earned some time off.
*  Yeah. Why don't you just take take some months off, just like a mark,
*  an extended hiatus, you know, whenever you feel like you could get away
*  and just decide you're going to take three months off,
*  put the fucking cell phone down, eat healthy exercise.
*  You mean you can hire a trainer, you know, not a bad idea.
*  There's nothing I'll do more than that.
*  Because, you know, I'm doing the sober October thing.
*  And when I've done it in the past, one of the things that we've done
*  is these fitness challenges.
*  You don't even realize what you can do until you're forced to do something.
*  If you force yourself, like, say, hey, for the month of January,
*  I'm not going to drink and I'm going to exercise every day.
*  And I'm going to put it up on, you know, my website
*  and let everybody know what I'm doing.
*  And just force yourself to try to get healthy, only eat healthy food
*  and maybe get a dietician, maybe get a trainer.
*  Not even maybe get a dietician, get a trainer, get someone
*  who makes you like meal preps for you, gives you healthy food to eat.
*  And this is all you're going to eat is this no no process bullshit,
*  just healthy food wouldn't be a bad idea.
*  Just take a whole month and do nothing but that.
*  Just leave the fucking news alone.
*  Let this crazy world sort itself out.
*  No, I agree, because now look at news.
*  It's just like you start like, oh, I got them right here.
*  I'll just be great.
*  I was like, now I'm almost like, oh, my God.
*  Yeah, because you're probably overrun.
*  You know, it's probably taxed out.
*  Your body's probably like barely hanging in there.
*  I mean, if you're boozing a lot and you're not getting sleep
*  and you're grinding your teeth, none of these are good signs.
*  I've been honest about the listeners, but, you know, at the end of the day,
*  like this is fundamental.
*  This is an anti-human movement.
*  It's a globalist movement.
*  And I get people that are doing it are sociopaths that have created cosmology
*  to explain why they're doing all these evil things.
*  I just I feel like it's such an important mission
*  that it should be exposed.
*  John, I'm just glad you moved to Austin.
*  I'm glad that Tim's here.
*  I'm glad that all this is moving.
*  He just told me, you know, I got to save L.A. first.
*  And then I want to go work with Bill and Melinda Gates.
*  You can't say that.
*  And then I will come to Austin.
*  You can't say that.
*  I know. I know.
*  We'll see. November 3rd.
*  So, Joe, what is your prediction?
*  Who wins? Who wins in six days?
*  I'm not smart enough to make the prediction, but I don't know.
*  I think it's going to be chaos either way.
*  It's going to be chaos.
*  I think of Trump.
*  I've never ever in my life felt this country more divided.
*  It feels more divided now than I've ever felt before,
*  where the possibility of a civil war doesn't seem outside the realm of possibilities.
*  It doesn't seem like something ridiculous.
*  It doesn't like people.
*  If they said it in the past, someone said all this country is on the brink of a civil war.
*  Ten years ago, I'd be like, listen, this crazy fuck.
*  But you say it now.
*  And I go like I could see it.
*  Tim, why are you not moving to Texas?
*  Well, I might eventually.
*  I might eventually. I don't know.
*  We're going to see. I got to open a comic.
*  Joe convinced me that Joe told me to move to L.A. a year ago.
*  And then I moved and it just destroyed.
*  So they told me to move here.
*  I might move here. It'll be a problem.
*  We're going to start a comedy club out here.
*  Yeah. We're going to set this place up right.
*  Well, thank you for having me.
*  My pleasure. Appreciate it.
*  I appreciate you being here.
*  Was everything. I hope. Yeah, good.
*  This was a great one. Alex, I think we got to see a side of you that they maybe even didn't see
*  in the other two podcasts.
*  You know, I think you did a great account of yourself.
*  And I think really, you think so? Yeah.
*  Yeah. A lot of the shit that you brought up today was, I mean,
*  you were pulling shit off the top of your head.
*  A lot of it was accurate.
*  A good, solid percent.
*  I'm not trying to bullshit.
*  No, you're not trying to bullshit.
*  No, I know you're not.
*  This is what I've always told people about you.
*  And and again, I think that we're at a critical time where we've got to rethink all these people
*  that are calling for people to be censored and calling for people to be deplatform.
*  And I think you got to rethink this.
*  I think everybody has to rethink this because you might be looking back on this 10 years from now
*  and going, oh, my God, what the fuck did I support?
*  But I agree with you. But we should.
*  You're being nice to the censors.
*  They're tyrants.
*  I think you hear everybody's.
*  I think there's a lot of people in this machine and a lot of these people, they're not tyrants.
*  They think they're doing good. They really do.
*  I think there's a lot of people that are out there calling for people to be deplatform,
*  calling for people to be censored because maybe they have children and they see their children
*  being indoctrinated into QAnon and all this kind of ridiculous thinking.
*  And maybe they think that the way to to fight some of this shit is to just take that stuff offline.
*  So the kids have no access.
*  That only makes their children want it more.
*  Well, not only that, it makes the people that believe that there's a conspiracy to silence the truth.
*  It makes them even more fervent in their beliefs.
*  They start believing it even more rabidly.
*  And not only that, it creates echo chambers.
*  And then again, that's positive.
*  You are happy you moved to Texas.
*  I fucking love it here.
*  I love the people. I love the I love the town.
*  I love everything about it.
*  I do. But that's the good news.
*  Yeah. And Tim Dillon.
*  You come here, lower taxes, good people.
*  We want all the people from other parts of the country.
*  Great food. Good food. Food here is amazing.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of great stuff.
*  And the kids here in the QAnon, which I think that's good.
*  All of them. Children should be in.
*  Well, they get tattooed when they're in the fifth grade.
*  Listen, I love you, Alex Jones.
*  Thanks for being here. I love you, Tim Dillon.
*  Thank you for having me. Thank you guys.
*  We did it. We did it. We did it.
*  All right. What would you three and a half hours?
*  Something like that. Yes.
*  And forward to infinity and beyond.
*  Band.Video. Don't visit it. Band.Video.
*  Bye, everybody. Thank you.
