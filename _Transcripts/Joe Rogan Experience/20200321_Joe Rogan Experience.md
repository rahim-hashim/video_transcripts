# Joe Rogan Experience #1445 - Andy Stumpf
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlFJm2wK7eo)
*  Two one and they stomp. How are you buddy? I'm good on a
*  Lot there's a lot happening. Do you have a hot take on this handy? What's your hot take? I?
*  Get text messages from people saying, you know, give me the inside scoop as to what's happening and what I should do
*  Yeah, and I don't have a good answer. I have the same information sources that everybody else does my concern is
*  Not that we shouldn't protect
*  People that are sick and people that are old
*  My concern is that these decisions are being done by politicians and that they they want to do this so that they can be elected
*  Come reelection. They don't want people to be upset at them for not acting and so they're making these decisions and
*  They're not showing us
*  Exactly how they're gonna get out of this like when you're shutting down Los Angeles for a month did just the
*  Staggering amount of people that are gonna be in debt and
*  And and there was some number that we looked it up recently of the amount of people that live check to check
*  It's crazy. It's like half of America the average American the stat
*  I saw was that they cannot absorb an expense outside of the normal over $400, right?
*  That's gone. That's already gone. So already most Americans are fucked now just with this dip and then they're talking about extending this to April 19th
*  I just don't I don't know if they have a plan
*  I don't know how they're gonna buy their way out of this. Like what do you do? How do you how do you help those folks?
*  I
*  Mean, I'm the wrong person to ask about that, but I would I would hope at least that the politicians
*  I'm sure there's an aspect always if you are a politician in the back of your mind
*  I have to conduct myself in a way where I can get reelected like everything is probably viewed through that but I would hope at least
*  that
*  They're viewing it through the humanity perspective and as far as the decisions they're making I don't think anybody knows what to do
*  Yeah, I don't think anybody knows what to do either. They feel like they have to do something. So they're doing something
*  We all need to look at Idris Elba because that guy looks fucking great he does he's still he's got it
*  He's got it and there's I mean he seems fine Tom Hanks. He says he's just kind of tired
*  It's I
*  Can't make heads or tails of it because if you go the longer you spend on your phone, I think the more or your computer
*  I think the more confused you'll actually become because I don't know
*  To be honest who's telling the truth and who is not there's stories of people saying hey, I tested positive for this
*  I don't have any symptoms. Hey, I live in Italy three people are dead in my hallway
*  And I got sick and I don't feel that good and then you watch people walking around in zombie apocalypse suits with you know
*  mop level four gear on
*  Not listening to you know how we walk on the beach yesterday and you know, there's there people there's huge social bubbles
*  They don't want to be near each other. Mm-hmm. And from what I can tell or from what I'm reading and again
*  It's it's so heads or tails, you know
*  you basically have to be coughed on or sneezed on or touch the surface that one of these infected people have
*  Touched or close proximity and there's people on the beach walking around and hazmat suits. It's a wild time
*  It's a wild time because of that because there's no clear information
*  Because you're seeing some people that look really healthy and then you're seeing the stories that come out of Italy one thing to take
*  Any consideration with Italy is Italy has one of the oldest populations. They have a lot of old people
*  And a shit ton of smokers those two factors are huge here because this is a respiratory disease
*  Well, don't they also have in comparison to the rest of the world more generations living in a single household?
*  Yes, which I would imagine is going to be you know, there's those generations move on you're gonna have higher risk people
*  Living with people who are low risk, but my transmitting it. Yes, that's the real concern
*  The real concern is you're gonna transmit it to your grandma or someone who's sick. There was a guy
*  It's weird how the news gives you these stories
*  Because there's a guy that was 34 years old that died and they said he just got back from Disneyland
*  You're like fuck. I thought you lived forever once you go to Disneyland. This is crazy. He just got back from Disneyland
*  How like the fact they put that he just got back from Disneyland's it's all heartstring pulling stuff
*  But then if you go deep into the story
*  This this young man just got over a testicular cancer. He had
*  bronchitis and
*  He had asthma. So there's a lot going on there. He had the deck stacked against him
*  He had the deck stacked against him. He's immune compromised for sure
*  Because of coming off of the testicular cancer and then on top of that with asthma and bronchitis
*  And then he gets a respiratory disease
*  Those are the people that really have to worry and I really wish
*  There was a clear way to help them other than shutting down everything for a month
*  I was talking to Evan Hafer this morning called out of the blue and we were having kind of a conversation about this and he
*  brought something up that
*  Just about the you know the narrative and it's to me what's happening right now is is
*  It's interesting from a couple of perspectives for one. I've traveled the world enough and
*  Seen people living in a variety of different living conditions that right now in my opinion at least
*  People are getting a glimpse
*  Into what it is like to live in the non first world
*  Where when maybe you don't even have a grocery store
*  But if you go there you can't get everything that you want and you can't travel all you know when you always want to you
*  Don't have the freedom of movement that you want a lot of people live their life
*  Take the virus out of the equation a lot of people live their life day to day
*  In situations just like this or much worse, so I think it should be eye-opening hopefully for people that
*  There's a thin
*  Margin between you know the excess and luxury that we have in the first world and how fast that can be removed and we can
*  Start stepping down that staircase
*  And
*  It shows to me you know I I
*  Try to view the videos that you see online of people fist fighting for a toilet paper
*  I think those are the anomaly and I try not to let the anomaly paint the norm
*  I don't think most people are doing that but there are people that are doing that and there are people who are going in
*  And they're hoarding and buying it's I don't think the toilet paper is a good example
*  I can give you 15 different ways to wipe your ass without toilet paper
*  Yeah, like you're gonna be okay like if do you have a garden hose? I mean we can start there
*  I'm not saying it's the most sanitary, but yeah
*  I think I've wiped my ass with a handful of gravel one time because that's all that I had not recommending it
*  But I'm just you know really oh for sure
*  Grownable it was what was in like close. Yeah, I mean why not I've I mean I have had many make it cleaner
*  I didn't really check I didn't have too much time
*  But I've had many days where I started with two socks and ended with one I've had t-shirts that became tank tops
*  I mean there's options that you have none of these I'm recommending for anybody
*  But what I'm saying is the toilet paper is not gonna make the difference between life or death
*  It's a weird one to hoard. It's a weird one that people are freaking out about
*  Food well, but they're scared and I find that when people get scared
*  Like we were talking about right before we went on
*  When people get drunk a couple of the layers of their protective like this is who I want to portray myself
*  it starts to strip away and
*  What I see are people who are super concerned about me and
*  Far less concerned about we and the conversation I was having with Evan was you know
*  It'd be great if we were talking about you know the people who are gonna get crushed
*  And I'm not you know an economic expert by any stretch, but are the ones you already talked about I live in paycheck to paycheck
*  How about the elderly who are in the high-risk category that are on Social Security fixed income?
*  And they can't even go out right now because they don't feel comfortable
*  Getting groceries that people are gonna get destroyed and I would love to have a conversation about a
*  Social construct or relationship that we have where we start talking about you know
*  What are we gonna do to get food and aid to these people?
*  What are we gonna do to come together and help everybody out instead of assholes and target hoarding toilet paper?
*  Yeah, and it's to me a lot of that is driven by
*  Fear and a lot of is driven by panic and believe me. I'm not an expert at all
*  Probably on anything in my life, but one thing that I have some experience in is
*  Surviving and thriving in high-risk situations that are high stress which is kind of what's going on right now
*  It's a different type of stress
*  And the most dangerous thing you can do is lose control your emotions or let your emotions take over your decision-making cycle
*  Which is what I see people doing and it's it's so dangerous
*  And I think we need to start finding ways to back away from that and start talking about the we
*  Greater than me. I don't think there's a toilet paper shortage
*  There's a shortage of people with common sense who are buying too much toilet paper, which is freaking other people out
*  So they're buying too much stuff, which they don't actually need which is freaking up. You know what I mean?
*  It's just a cascading effect. Yeah, it's a fear cascade. Yeah, it's not good
*  It's not good. It's also this is the first time we've as a nation have been tested like this
*  Well that with a crisis where the country had shut down we don't have any experience in it
*  So we don't know what to expect
*  What I hope is it it gives me a little bit of flashes is the right after 9-eleven because we have had times where the
*  Country shut down, but it was very very brief. Mm-hmm, but I remember like the solidarity
*  After 9-eleven it was all about we and not about me and I hope that it trends that direction
*  Because who knows when this is gonna end. I mean my kids are out of school. I think for the year
*  Yeah, I think mine as well and you know, what if you're a single parent?
*  Yeah, and you have to work right and what if your kids are getting two of their three meals per day
*  Yeah at school and I and I you know the school system in Montana where I live is already
*  You know, they're actually doing a really good job come to these locations
*  You can get free meals, but that's assuming the kid has a way to get there because well Montana is scalable, right?
*  There's a million people in the entire state. The state's fucking massive. It's not out of control
*  California is 40 million fucking people and this one spot. It's so preposterous. Yeah, and there's so much poverty
*  There's so many people that are we're barely hanging on as it is and now they're off the cliff and they don't know what
*  To do and there's no real protection set in place now to keep them from being evicted
*  I don't believe you know
*  I don't you know unscrupulous landlords people that have been looking for a reason to get rid of these people in the first place
*  Fuck man, who knows who knows who knows what's gonna go on? It's real confusing
*  It's real confusing and have you seen the stats like the here? I'm gonna show this to Jamie
*  maybe we could put this up on the on the screen because it's kind of it's
*  It's it's really kind of crazy that this is the choice that they've made to shut everything down
*  I'm so honest to right now. Well, you know, it's funny right they made that choice last night. So we got to we got here
*  Thursday so a day before they made that decision and the decision was made last night and went into effect and exactly the same
*  Amount of people are still out. Yeah, exactly the same amount. I mean, there's no real law
*  I mean, it's it's more of a recommendation than anything, but they do have to close businesses
*  Well, I think they were hoping that people do buy into a social contract like maybe we can care about the we
*  Over me, but I just you see people
*  Not doing that when they're pressed. Yeah, and that and that gets rough. So here's the numbers, right?
*  Hospitalizations intensive care unit admission case by case fatality percentages reported for kovat 19 by 18
*  A kovat 19 by age group. So this is up until March 16th. It was just a couple days ago. So
*  0 to 19 there's a hundred and twenty three cases one point six to two point five or hospitalized zero ICU
*  Zero fatality. So then you get 20 to 44. That's you
*  705 cases
*  14.3 to 20.8
*  hospitalizations
*  2 to 4
*  ICU and 0.1 to 0.2 case fatality
*  Now you've got to think those people are pre-existing conditions just looking at those numbers 45 to 54
*  That's my age group
*  429 cases less for some weird reason
*  21 to 28
*  hospitalization 5.4 to 10.4
*  ICU 1.4 to 2.6 fatality
*  Again, you got to think those people are pre-existing conditions and it gets all the way up to really old
*  Let's go to 85 plus this Callan's age. That's Callan's age. Yeah, I heard in 44 hospitals 144 cases
*  31 out of 144 to 70
*  hospitalization 31.3 to 70.3 hospitalization 6 to
*  29 ICU
*  fatalities 10 to 27 so the vast majority of
*  Fatalities you looking at people between 75 and 84, which is 4.3 to 10.5 and then 85
*  Plus which is 10.4 to 27.3. So it's it's really obviously not good for really old people
*  It looks like you got a 25%
*  Fatality rate at the worst-case scenario for hospitalized people that have the case
*  But again
*  For young healthy people it's not what it's being it's not it's not the big monster that everybody thinks it is
*  I mean, there's people running around
*  Terrified that are young and healthy. Well, then there's no concern is older folks. Well, there's a spectrum, too
*  There's the young people running around terrified and healthy and then there's the people who are mobbing beaches in Florida on spring break saying
*  our future leaders fuck it uh
*  Be gone by the time they're the future leaders, but yeah
*  It's hilarious
*  But and you have to assume though that those numbers are completely
*  Inaccurate, but I would imagine the number because of the lack of testing but the percentages are probably still the same
*  You know, I think there's probably just bigger numbers
*  Yeah, it's uh, well kids are just gonna be kids man. You get 18 year olds on the beach in Florida
*  They're there to fuck they're not worried about catching
*  The kovat 19. They don't even know what the fuck that is. Their brains aren't even formed yet
*  Yes, my nine-year-old says they have mushy brains. I was trying to explain to the nine-year-old
*  What the the development of the frontal lobe is and I'm like, you know, cuz we were just talking about I
*  Talked to my kids like their kids, but I also talked to them like they're adults
*  I do the same in that I I lay things out and then I explain so I lay things out like I'd lay to an
*  Adult and then I'm like your frontal lobe is a part of your brain that makes the decisions and it's not fully developed
*  25 years old and so you see the little nine-year-old brain spinning I go it's not not really ready yet
*  She's like so it's like squishy brain. I go exactly
*  Nine-year-old Dracula. I like it
*  This is how she explained to my wife and then her and I had this little conversation about squishy brain and I'm like this
*  This is what the frontal lobe is. This is like when you see people that are young they're doing stupid things
*  It's not even necessarily that they're stupid. They they're just acting. They just they're wild, you know, they're they're free
*  Their parents probably tell them what to do too much the school tells them what to do too much their job tells them what to
*  Do too much and then they're out and they have a couple fucking Miller high-lives, you know
*  By the way, have you seen the coronavirus song yet ice you posted it I saw it I watched it again
*  I knew soon and Jamie roll it. Let's we can't play it. No
*  Really think so you need to respect other people's intellectual property how it works wouldn't help them
*  But I mean is that on Spotify or even do they have a label? They definitely could I think they're comics
*  They could go on and take the video down
*  We're trying to help you guys. Sorry go to my Instagram. I was just gonna say that's probably that's where I saw it
*  Yeah, I might have watched it fiber. Yeah the ten times
*  No, that's okay. You're right. I'm being an idiot
*  But the gentleman who who made it these guys have been one of one of them reached out to me and I fucked up
*  It's Reggie, baby
*  Be two and then there's a fucking Reggie babe be
*  E2 underscore that's a fake account those cunts and so I accidentally tagged the fake account
*  I'm gonna say that's how mistakes happen. But now I got the real it well
*  It's just some fucking hoaxer who's pretended to be him
*  The fake one is the one that has the underscore after the two
*  That was pieces of shit. How's your that's the real dude Reggie, baby
*  I mean, how's your wife think about what's going on?
*  She's not concerned about us. She's concerned about her mom, you know, which we should be and I'm concerned about my parents as well
*  Yeah, you know and more concerned that people are freaking out and you know
*  there's a lot of people around us that have never been tested and
*  They're not good under stress and this is a this is a very unusual stress because there's no clear answer
*  Not from the president not from the
*  Doctors, it's not no one has a real clear answer of how to fix this when it's gonna be fixed
*  Yeah, and when you hear things about like a vaccine will be available in 18 months like what well
*  And if you continue reading that says if it is available in 18 months, that would be three times faster than normal Wow
*  So that would be on the very front leading edge of what would be possible to get into people's hands
*  Normal would be 3x that in Oscar home the guy who was on the podcast
*  It really sparked a lot of people to take this very seriously. It was excellent podcast, by the way
*  Yeah, he's amazing and he said that they could have had a coronavirus vaccine that once SARS happened SARS
*  Which is also a coronavirus they could have worked on developing a coronavirus vaccine then and that we are far too flippant
*  About how we approach these things and if it's not they are right in our face
*  They don't allocate resources towards those kind of things. I
*  Think our society is kind of defined by its excess and luxury. Yeah, and
*  When you live in that environment and I'm not saying it negatively at all
*  But if you live in that environment if you never leave that environment if you don't bend yourself before the world bends you a little
*  Bit shit's gonna come off the rails when you get pressed
*  Yeah, and that's where the behavior of people scares me far more than the actual virus itself
*  I mean, I have no control over if I get the virus in how that plays itself out for me
*  I cannot control that
*  But I can control my behavior and how I act and try to exude calm like when it comes to my kids or my family
*  my friends and my social circle
*  but
*  Yeah, I wish I would I hope that people on the other side of this because it's not gonna be the end of the world
*  But I hope on the other side it gives them in a greater understanding and appreciation and perspective
*  Of what we have how lucky we are and then just maybe to think about you know
*  The people what's the obesity rate in the US right now?
*  It's very 40% yeah, how about we work on that just a touch considering?
*  that's one of the highest risk factors right instead of allowing that excess and
*  You know luxury to define you. Yeah, how about that's something you can control at all times?
*  Yeah, you can't control whether or not you have a disease or whether or not you're old
*  Yeah, but you certainly can control whether or not you're fat. The problem is people
*  In my experience spend a lot of time energy and effort focusing on things that they cannot control
*  And that is definitely one thing that I learned from my old job is that at some point you have to surrender
*  the
*  Emotional and mental horsepower on the things that you can't control and only focus on the things that you can which is specifically yourself
*  Like I like you can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you receive what happens to you and being scared
*  Allowing that to make the decision-making process for you is what gets people in substantial trouble like I'll give you an example for my old job
*  Getting shot at is not awesome. It's actually it can be quite terrifying and
*  the number one rule of a firefight if you get into a gunfight is
*  To win but the first thing you need to do is you need to shoot back with overwhelming fire superiority
*  And then you have to maneuver right you have to pin your enemy in place, and you have to maneuver
*  But let's say they you get ambushed and you're on the receiving end of that and so you take a knee behind a wall and bullets
*  Are snapping over your head and you don't want to move because you're scared and you think I'm gonna die
*  so you have fear of death, which is totally real and it can paralyze people and
*  Instead of moving you sit there and other people maneuver around you
*  That fear of death preventing you from doing the things that you had control over shooting back
*  maneuvering coordinating with your team that fear paralyzes you and
*  External circumstances or the enemy that you're fighting will maneuver around you and then they're gonna end up killing you
*  But the reason you didn't move is you allowed that emotion to take over your decision-making process
*  You have to detach the two Jocko talks about it a lot and it's just reinforced constantly and training in in
*  Operations overseas and that'd be like that's because people ask me like what should I do and my biggest thing is just
*  Try to remain as objective as possible
*  you see people freaking out that doesn't mean that you need to freak out and
*  You know another way I've had it described to me
*  That made a big influence on me and the way I think about things if you think about two circles like an archery target
*  but there's only two circles there's a
*  The bowl the ten ring which is super small and then god damn it Dudley. Where are you when I need you?
*  What's the big ring?
*  on the outside yeah like five I
*  Guess so you see goes ten nine eight out whatever the lowest scoring ring is that would be the other one
*  so you got two circles and
*  The big circle is your circle of concern and the small circle is your circle of influence I
*  See and the dangerous thing that I see often is people spending all their time with their energy and effort on
*  the circle of concern
*  What's going on in the stock market? What's going on on Fox News? What's going on on CNN?
*  Sharing back and forth things on Facebook that are probably half of them aren't even true anyway. No research put into it
*  Is there gonna be enough toilet paper? What do I do about this?
*  They don't have control over any of those things
*  But that's the stuff that they're worried about
*  Yeah
*  And the only thing that you should spend your time energy and effort working on are the things directly inside of your circle of influence
*  And even inside of that one there could be the circle of control
*  And what do you have control over at all times the things that come out of your mouth?
*  How you behave whether or not you allow your emotions to override your decision-making process?
*  The way that you communicate whether or not you decide to work out as opposed to shoving
*  4,000 excess calories in your face every single day
*  If you focus on those things and put your time energy and effort in there
*  You're gonna get through stressful situations just fine because you actually have more
*  mental capacity
*  Because you're trimming off other things you can't control. Mmm, the thing about things that you can't control those some people are
*  They're thinking that this is one of those things that if you were a paranoid person and you prepped and worried about the future
*  You would have already stockpiled enough food and toilet paper and ammo and all these different things so that you were ready for this
*  Whereas people that were just concentrating on day-to-day life didn't act didn't think it's probably got caught
*  Probably a balance in between. I mean, is it reasonable for everybody to have five years of food at their house?
*  I don't think so. I mean that's basically military MREs and I hope you enjoy taking a shit every two weeks
*  You know those things oh man, you will shit the clay man those mountain ops
*  Oh my god
*  the last time I ate mountain ops when I went on a hunt the farts that were coming out of my body were the
*  some of the worst smells I
*  Didn't know I could produce and I I know that they taste good
*  They do taste good and I know it's it's good to have, you know, freeze-dried or dehydrated meals
*  It's very lightweight. You can pack them out really easy, but Jesus Christ. What is happening internally?
*  I live 90 days one time purely on military MREs, which stands for meal ready to eat
*  it was the initial invasion of Iraq and that's all we had and
*  So there's a couple versions, but there's a cold weather version and when I was in at least it came in a white bag
*  It was for like Alpine cold weather operations
*  So it had more calories and it had more tasty things in there and we had our hands on those
*  But you know, there's some good ones like beef stew was my favorite
*  I think it was meal number eight and then there's some terrible ones. We called it like five fingers of death
*  It was hot dogs and I don't know when or where these fucking things were made
*  But I mean your bulletproof vest could barely contain it if you were to throw this is like eating a cylinder of titanium
*  They were disgusting and I don't I can't recognize the meat source. Oh
*  and
*  At first it was like, okay
*  I could eat the main meal and then my appetite started going and then this are those crackers that come with it
*  So I could eat those because they'd come with like jelly or peanut butter jam and there's actually a full
*  Economic system inside of the military trading that shit like you can stock up on peanut butters and get some strawberry jam
*  Oh, and there's some pound cakes that are good. The lemon poppy seed pound cake is the best
*  I don't care what anybody says and the longer it went the less I could eat and by the end of that
*  I was just eating skittles
*  It was all I could do and then we get this care package right before we left
*  Baghdad and it was like a palette of Girl Scout cookies and
*  Like the entire unit
*  I mean not everybody did this but basically we were ineffective for 48 hours because guys stomachs were so destroyed
*  from eating all of the MREs and you'd see guys just take a sleeve of thin mints and just buy
*  And then it came with coffee too. Oh god, and so guys are just laying on there because we were saying, you know
*  You'd think it's like this high-speed sexy stuff
*  we were standing cots in a totally gunned out airplane hanger at Baghdad and there was pigeons flying over us and
*  We would shoot them and they would spiral into people's beds and we would celebrate and guys are just laying in their racks
*  Just like oh
*  It's just shut down
*  Those MREs will fuck you up
*  Oh god, they're so calorically dense like you need to be drinking like eight gallons of water a day
*  And you're still gonna be like I haven't gone to the bathroom in four days. I think I might die. Yeah, I was wondered
*  I mean, I was eating a can of sardines the other day
*  I was like, how can you keep fish fresh in a fucking tin?
*  Is it the idea that there's no air in there?
*  Is that all it is don't they cook it and put it in there right at the end of the cooking process?
*  I guess but then like how's it in there? What the fuck's going on? How's it? Okay? I don't know
*  But sardines are disgusting so I don't like them see that's in my circle of concern
*  I like sardines and oysters. Do you have smoked oysters in a can? No, it sounds disgusting
*  Delicious. I like them. The latest addition to my diet is I started buying diced clams and adding it to clam chowder
*  Oh, it's about as controversial as I get with my straight meat and potatoes guy. You one of those fellas. I am NOT
*  Exploratory with my food at all. Well, you eat a lot of wild game
*  Well, yeah, but that's that's awesome. I have a lot of elk and a lot of deer
*  But I don't you know, I don't need to go into the world some people that's exploratory
*  Well, I've stuck with it now for a few years. I would say I'll put like this if I go to a foreign country
*  I'm looking for something that I recognize. I'm not interested in sampling the local cuisine. I've had some bad experiences
*  Is that why you're gun chai?
*  Like if we go to Thailand
*  Thailand so I've been to Thailand a bunch and I love their cow pot guy the chicken fried rice
*  I need the shit out of that. That's it, but I'm not touching a balut
*  Yeah, Baluts rough. We served that on fear factor. My Filipino friends were laughing. They're like, dude, that's a delicacy
*  Like we love balut eat that little well, that's disgusting. So we were there
*  Apparently it's delicious as a new guy and they're like here's baluts
*  You will eat these because we're hazing you and it's like awesome. Oh haze you they give you a delicacy
*  I don't think of fermented rotten egg
*  Is it fermented but they meant oh, yeah, they bury those things
*  Is that the same thing because there's the hundred-year-old egg?
*  These are not hundred-year-old but these are definitely buried fermented like when you're peeling off the egg. It's purple
*  Oh, see, that's weird because the balut that we serve was not like that
*  Maybe there's different ways to serve it because the the purple stuff is that's that hundred-year-old egg stuff
*  Maybe there's like fermented balut and then regular balut. I just started throwing up before I put it in my mouth
*  So yeah, it's just disgusting. And of course we weren't sober either
*  So the eggs that we serve people on fear factor when we're serving them hundred-year-old egg
*  That was the other thing that we served. They're not really a hundred-year-old egg
*  It's just an expression
*  but it's a
*  That is the I think the idea is that they cook them and then they bury them in the ground or something like that and the
*  gelatinous
*  Outer area that used to be the white of the egg is like this black jelly. It's like black jelly
*  Yeah, so we should put that in our mouth. That sounds great. Let's see Chinese people love it
*  Like there's a lot of people that actually enjoy it
*  Apparently the most disgusting food and this is coming from the late great Anthony Bourdain that he ever tried was fermented shark from Iceland
*  He said there are no words to describe the the putrid
*  disgusting smell and taste
*  he's like he couldn't imagine that people would ever acquire a taste for this and
*  it's a
*  fermented shark and
*  He said I don't remember what the history of eating those things are
*  I mean it must have come from some time of great famine where this is the the only thing they had
*  I've had shark before not sure not fermented actually go I enjoyed shark when I was coming up actually
*  Yeah, what the fuck happened where you're not supposed to kill sharks
*  Like now if you catch a shark people think you're a monster so it's like shooting a baby deer
*  I'm not a fan of the man in the gray wetsuit. I've spent enough time in the water
*  I don't I just know let's stay away not a fan either and I watched that movie the other day with my family the
*  What is the the new?
*  47 meters down or something like that. What is there's a couple versions?
*  Well, I don't know that there's the sharknado. There's the that one's ridiculous
*  This one is more like a shark this one's more or less ridiculous
*  Yes, it's a bunch of hot girls and bikinis that go cave diving and they find blind sharks that live
*  Deep in the caves and then they they get a spoiler alert. Yeah people get fucked up. Here's an idea
*  Don't go cave diving. Let's just stay out of the water
*  Yeah, I'm not a fan of the water anymore at all anymore. Were you ever a fan? Oh, then I grew up in Santa Cruz
*  We surfer doing junior lifeguards, I mean I surfed I wouldn't call myself a surfer
*  I could like stand up and fall over on a board, right?
*  It's like if you've gone fishing twice, you're not a fisherman
*  No, but I grew up on the beach and my summers and did junior lifeguards and then you go get
*  Tortured with water and spend an immense amount of time and water and like I'm completely good
*  I don't want to ever go in here voluntarily again. Good call. Yeah. Yeah waters weird
*  It's like I enjoy the fact that it's real
*  I like the fact that there's like this is an alternative world that's connected to us
*  I have snorkeled several times and I enjoyed it for brief periods of time
*  But I'm always very relieved when I get out of the water deep was the water
*  I imagine you snorkeling in like three to four feet of water. No, we're is probably 12 12 15
*  Not that not that deep though. I was with Dudley and
*  Yeah, we're in Lanai we went snorkeling it's fun. It's kind of cool
*  You see some turtles and shit and some fish not that many fish. That's what was kind of weird
*  You know you like you would think I was a whole world down there. Oh, yeah, but why would the fuck they'll be by the people?
*  Why would these fish be hanging around while these assholes are peeing and I get it, you know, yeah
*  The oceans another one too. You got to surrender a little bit. Yeah
*  I mean you got no control over that sucker and you can try to control it
*  I've watched people try to control and they just get they get crushed
*  Yeah, and if you see something, you know see something underwater like you're basically it's mercy
*  It's like if you were in a wheelchair. It gets better than that. Yeah, so imagine doing
*  dives in water that has you know the
*  Phosphorescence so when things move through it it it'll light up those yeah, and you're always with a dive buddy and
*  We'll do a lot of closed-circuit diving. So you're rebreathing
*  Oxygen you purge your body of the what is it carbon dioxide and you have a chemical scrubber that scrubs out the carbon dioxide
*  So it goes in one side and it goes through this loop. So there's no bubbles
*  You can stay underwater for a long time. I think you talked with Trevor about it
*  Oh, yeah, that stuff he was diving. So you're with a dive buddy
*  And we'll do or they will still do now
*  Like long distance underwater navigation and you would think there's some high-speed computer
*  You have a depth gauge a stopwatch and a compass and that's your entertainment for the sometimes four hours that you're underwater
*  Mind you only one of the two people is holding this the other person has zero entertainment
*  For that time period because you're just along for the ride as the buddy
*  So you're like holding on to their elbow to pinch them to make sure you're still there
*  But most the time like if you're the driver the person navigating
*  Your buddy will stay on one side of you and you know that you're there because they'll check in every once in a while and
*  Squeeze your elbow and I had on more than one occasion
*  diving in the dark
*  weird noises under there because with a rebreather, you know, you don't have the
*  As you exhale so you can hear the crackling and the eating and boats come over your head
*  It sounds like you're gonna die at any time
*  And perhaps I have an over a man an active imagination
*  I'm just you know, I've watched jaws too many times
*  So I'm sitting there trying to navigate and then just thinking like oh my god
*  We're gonna get eaten by a shark
*  But my buddy is on my right-hand side and you'll get slammed by something on your left and you'll just see it go off in
*  the phosphorescence the question is
*  Do you look or do you just keep your head down and keep going?
*  What do you do?
*  I just kept my head down and kept going because you can't do anything
*  I couldn't do anything and if I had looked and I've been in a shark
*  I would have probably killed myself just doing a nuclear submarine porpoise thing out of the water
*  So what do you think it was?
*  Probably a sea lion or a dolphin or it could have been damn near been a shark
*  But it happened to me on more than one occasion and more and two more guys than you would think you're just under there and something
*  Bumps into you and you know, it's on the opposite side of your die, buddy. It is not an awesome experience
*  How many guys get lost to sharks doing that?
*  I don't know of anybody in the seal community who has been lost due to a shark that's amazing
*  Isn't that amazing? Well, I mean the stats are on your side
*  Yeah, but still you would think one guy like I know guys have been struck by lightning. I
*  Wonder what your odds are lightning strike versus shark attack. I bet it's way higher lightning strike if you're outside
*  Then if you're in the water
*  I know of them canceling dives because there was shark activity in the area
*  But I don't know of a single guy who's actually had an interaction where they got bit Wow
*  That's pretty impressive. I would imagine there would be a few losses over the years
*  Well, if you think well, like most of the diving I did down in San Diego, you're not diving out in the ocean
*  You're diving in the bay like you're going in shallower water
*  You're in and around the piers and I'm not an expert on sharks by by any stretch
*  So I don't know. I don't think that's necessarily their natural habitat. I think they're farther out there out right off of Malibu
*  They didn't even realize how many of them there were people start flying drones
*  So they fly these drones like a couple hundred yards off of people's area and there's fucking great whites swimming around
*  You're like what?
*  Ocean will fuck you up. You have no control over that. It's an again. So in you in that moment
*  You're like I remember I had these conversations myself just get slammed and you see it out of the corner eye
*  It's like yeah, that didn't happen. Let's just keep going four hours. That's about the longest
*  I've been underwater yet exhaustion dive on a Drager in those rebreather's some people have
*  episodes of epilepsy or of seizures when they these oxygen toxicity is an issue and then they're because of the chemical
*  Scrubber, of course the chemical scrubber reacts negatively to water
*  So we should put it in a container and then submersive in the water under pressure
*  And it's held on by a hand tight and screw
*  damn
*  And you crazy that it works. It works really really well until it doesn't and you see people do the nuclear submarine
*  Ripping their mouthpiece out because it's called a caustic cocktail
*  There's a it's there's one-way valves in each of the hoses. So the loop has to be correct and continuous
*  So when you exhale it needs to go into the scrubber and then when you inhale it needs to come
*  Because if there was no one-way valve, you know
*  I mean the oxygen would flow through the system without being able to recharge because if you inhale enough
*  It'll give you another hit of pure oxygen and it can continue that cycle
*  But so if the canister will start to fill up and you can hear it too
*  Like every after every dive you will dump you maintain your own gear
*  But you'll dump out the canister and the chemical it'll turn at least the stuff that I was using when I was in it
*  It'll turn like a purplish color as it's the effectiveness is starting to
*  Reduce you can actually do more than one die with it because you open the container up and you make sure that the chemicals are
*  Okay, and then you tilt it over and on every dive
*  Water starts coming out of it and you can hear it on dives to it'll start gurgling a little bit like as you're inhaling
*  Oh, no. Oh, it's
*  And again, you can spend time worrying about that or you can just drive on and deal with if it becomes an issue
*  You can deal with it at that time. What do you do?
*  Issue you have to get to the surface it was so when what do you do?
*  You got to get fresh air. You need to wash your mouth out and you need to get to a higher level of care
*  So if you are two hours into a four-hour swim
*  Yep with a rebreather and you pop your head off the surface and you're gagging. What do you do?
*  There's gonna be a there's always a safety ratio in those training evolutions. So you're gonna have a diving supervisor
*  Well, everybody's underwater. You're gonna have a pretty robust network of people that are up there for safety
*  So the dive has been planned you've probably already coordinated with you know where the nearest chamber is you've notified the chamber that you're diving
*  So if you have a pressure related issue
*  You know where the nearest hospital is you have a primary secondary and tertiary medical plan and I think I forget what it was
*  But I think it was you know one dive soup per maybe four dive pairs and you dive with buoys in training
*  So there's boats that are up top that are not only are they
*  There to help in case an emergency would come up but you know boats don't see those little buoys because it's just a little
*  Orange buoy traveling along and at nighttime you put you know chem light glow sticks on them
*  Which nobody is looking for so boats are up there to basically push other boats away
*  So you'll get up there and you literally just you know
*  You wave your hand and the boat will come over and they're gonna get you to a corpsman
*  Which is you know the medical personnel on the Navy side of the house and they're gonna start treating you right there
*  But the chemical the cost of cocktails are gnarly. I mean guys will just come up projectile vomiting
*  It doesn't happen that often but every dive you dip you dip that thing over and the water starts coming out of it
*  Jesus Christ, it's just crazy that it does work that you can breathe underwater with no bubbles. It works
*  Well works really well. Yeah, most of the time you're limited by the amount of oxygen in the cylinder
*  Not the effectiveness of the chemical scrubber itself. How long is it supposed to last for?
*  Whoo, I do not know off the top of my head, but you an exhaustion dive
*  On a dragger for me. You could go somewhere between three and a half to four hours
*  Which is just it's mind-numbing. That's crazy. You could just breathe into that thing. Mm-hmm
*  It's super quiet
*  The only noise that it makes is when you have a demand valve that kicks in it'll give you a hit of that pure oxygen
*  Just that's what it sounds like and then other than that's pure
*  That's what I'm saying
*  You can hear so much more you hear all the crustaceans down there and all the clicking
*  You can sneak up on animals because you're not making as much noise
*  Seems like it would be a good thing to wear if you were scuba diving or you were spearfishing rather
*  It's limited by the depth because you take oxygen down to depth. That's we're gonna get the o2 toxicity issues
*  So on those dives we're talking 20 feet to the surface is where you need to set. Yeah
*  Yeah, fuck that won't work
*  No, unless there's awesome spearfishing at 20 feet. I heard spearfishing is the shit everybody that's done it says it's amazing
*  It's like hunting underwater. I'll never be able to tell you because I'm not going to voluntarily go in the fucking water
*  Well, it's understandable you did your time dude, I didn't know I was listening to your podcast
*  I didn't know that you were involved in the rescue of Jessica Lynch
*  That was the second target that we hit in the first invasion of Iraq
*  That's crazy. It was an odd series of events. The you know, we went over there
*  I had just finished the selection process for the East Coast command and they actually
*  There are
*  Will be the best way to describe it
*  There are multiple
*  Squadrons inside of that command all tasks with they're all have the same skill set
*  But you need multiple so one can be on deployment while another one is training and the other one is resting you want to get
*  Into a you know a rotation cycle
*  So at the end of selection an X number of people get
*  Partitioned off to each one of those and it takes time to get up to speed because the selection
*  tactics and the way that you train are
*  they're
*  Good but you get better as you were working with the guys with more experience specifically the real-world experience
*  And so they pulled us out of selection about a month early and sent us over to augment the Karzai detail in
*  Afghanistan at the very tail end. I mean nothing happened
*  We basically you know, you're a deterrent at that point and it's one of the worst missions because you can't it's very reactive
*  Security detail stuff. You can't really do anything until somebody else does something. So you're already behind the power curve
*  It's my least favorite mission set I think
*  But we came back from that and then the Intel started
*  kicking off for Iraq and they sent us over to Saudi Arabia and we were there for
*  Probably somewhere between seven to ten days. That's where I watched Bush give the speech
*  you know, Saddam Hussein has I think it was 24 hours to comply or turn himself in whatever it was and
*  We had already taken a look at we knew before going over there that there were two or three
*  Objectives that we were gonna look at so we had already basically planned missions that we were gonna do while we were in Virginia Beach
*  We were planning for stuff in Iraq. So we continue the planning in
*  Saudi Arabia and the number one the first target we hit was the number one chem bio target in Iraq
*  So to do that, you have to get all your shit on this. It's called mop gear mission oriented protective posture
*  It's like a chemical chem bio suit
*  gas mask
*  Which compounds a lot of stuff you have all your normal shit on anyway
*  Like there's guys carrying quickie saws in a hazmat suit with a gas mask on breathing through a blower on their back
*  Overworking the blower and it's amazing how close to suffocation. I've actually come inside of those gas masks
*  It's the worst feeling ever like that
*  You're sucking so hard for air that the mask is like sticking up because you're not supposed to be physically exerting yourself while you're wearing
*  That thing there's a limp. It's just it's harder
*  It's be like putting the because there's a canister on the side and how much weight are you carrying around?
*  In those days, it was probably body weight plus 8200 pounds
*  Jesus Christ that was about average and it trimmed down after that because the actual amount of real-world experience at that time
*  Was low and it drastically increased so you'd be like, you know, I think I need this pocket and then you wouldn't need it for
*  A month or I need to get rid of this goddamn pocket because it carries sweat and like backpack hunters same kind of thing
*  Oh, yeah, the gear that I wore towards the end was substantially different than the gear that I wore towards the beginning
*  I trimmed I mean, I think I probably had ten magazines on me like that first target
*  I think the last deployment I did I would carry four four one on the gun and no pistol
*  So things changed over time
*  but this just for weight just for weight and for ability to move because then I would need less food and I would need less water and
*  I'd actually be mobile
*  But on this target, so it was a four-hour helicopter ride in we're sitting there. We have all of our mop gear on but not our masks
*  And we're doing a mid-air refuel on a c130. So you had a 47 double, you know the big double
*  Not propellers. It'd be rotor blades on top of the helicopter
*  They're hooked up next to a c130 in-flight refueling missile goes underneath the c130 is like see you boys later
*  bombs out and
*  It like so the c130 bailed when the missile flew. Oh fuck. Yeah, I don't blame him for that either
*  They're literally a flying fuel tank
*  But I think they had gotten enough gas and we had to hit the tanker on the way back as well
*  But so you're just sitting there waiting for three and a half, you know
*  three and three quarter hours and about ten minutes out you start getting your gas mask and stuff on because you got a stuff that
*  drape and
*  You know night vision goggles. Have you ever looked through pair night vision? Yeah, your field of view sucks. It's terrible
*  It's weird, which is why you notice when people who are actually using them
*  They will all constantly have movement in their head because they're increasing their field of view and up and down
*  And that's when you can orient them to a good offset to your eye now imagine putting a gas mask in between
*  Your eye and the lens of the night vision goggle. Oh Jesus
*  So you're taking already a limited field of view and putting it into a soda straw
*  so
*  And mind you this is the first combat target I've ever been on so and you're 18. Oh, no, no, there's 22
*  No, I went through how old do you me 42? I was in my at the time
*  This was in 2003. It was 25. Okay
*  25
*  But you you enlisted when you were really young 17 junior in high school
*  I signed the paperwork when I was a junior in high school used I didn't you still got a graduate and then you know continue on
*  but
*  And I was in like the third or fourth
*  47 that went in so you finally get all your stuff on you know, and you have a blower on your back
*  So there's ways that you can help the canister if you just have the canister on your mask
*  It's a lot like breathing through a few straws shoved in your mouth
*  If you maintain a low enough heart rate and you're totally chill you're fine
*  But as your heart rate goes up and your demand, you know for oxygen goes up. You're really limited
*  So they have you know, you can put them on your back. It's a blower
*  It's a battery powered blower that will basically push air into the mask and it gives you I would say more buffer space
*  It's like almost like a positive pressure and if you're not doing much, it's actually really nice
*  It's just jam and aired in your face
*  And it works well unless you put your weapon sling over the top of that tube, which is exactly what I did
*  Awesome, I was great. I had a great first experience. I lost my nods on my first target ever
*  I went back and got him but it was a fucking shit show. What's nods night vision goggles? Oh
*  things that you need to see at night and we'll get in trouble for if you lose like
*  It's terrible. So we
*  come in
*  number one chem biotarget in Iraq and we had looked at it from the perspective of like air conditioning specialists in when you know from
*  Architects to what we could encounter on the ground potential threats satellite imagery of historical stuff and we get there and
*  By the time I even got on the ground
*  There was already a firefight going on the helicopter that I was in had 27 rounds come through the helicopter
*  Not a single person was hurt
*  Like guys were like reaching up to like scratch their ass and like a round would come through and dismiss everybody Jesus Christ
*  I took well I take that back the door gunner standing next to me got shot right in the head then about a minute out
*  That was my first exposure to combat just over and
*  Helicopter lands and you go and by the time I got to the front door of that
*  structure I was
*  Probably as close to being unconscious due to asphyxiation as I often am doing
*  Choked out like the world is just coming down and it instantaneously we could tell
*  That it was as a agricultural school like the intelligence was so horribly and incredibly off when it came to that
*  So I just ripped my mask off at some point because I would have rather died from whatever
*  horrendous disease could have been in there then suffocate and then you know
*  We cleared through it and I knocked my night vision goggles off with a sledgehammer. I had to go back
*  It was a shit show so we get back from that the next morning
*  We wake up and I remember having a cup of coffee with a buddy of mine
*  I was like, hey, man
*  I don't think we're gonna get out of this if things keep going like they did last night and
*  Shortly after that a few days after that we got word that Jessica had been
*  captured so we forward staged and went up to Nasiriyah and
*  The information that we had going into the hospital is that it was a fed IE
*  Hotbed like 50 to 500 people was the expected
*  Amount of resistance that we could have and we could fit 27 people in the helicopter
*  so that's what we launched with in the back of our head and
*  Fortunately, we didn't meet any resistance inside of the structure and it actually was kind of business as usual looking back like there was nothing exciting about that target
*  whatsoever people in the modern day if they were to action that target now with the experience that they have that you wouldn't even
*  Register on the radar scope the amount the little or the little amount of resistance that was encountered outside
*  It just would be another day at the office
*  But there was a public story of that and then there was a lot of dispute about whether or not that was accurate
*  There was a like I remember she actually she cleared up a lot of it
*  She well she was not responsible for a lot of the things that were said because she was deep into
*  The repatriation process into I mean her she's fucked up to this day when I met sat down
*  I probably get to sit across the table. She had never sat down and talked to somebody who was there
*  It was so did you meet her? I went had her on yeah, I had
*  It was one of the earlier episodes
*  I didn't even know you had her on so she told her side of the story
*  I told my side of the story and we were able to like fill my gaps and we sat across the table just like this
*  And she still wears a brace she came and gave me a huge hug. I mean I didn't know what to expect
*  What happened to her physically?
*  Man I don't have the exact details but
*  From my understanding the vast majority of her injuries came from when her Humvee wrecked
*  I do not believe she was buckled or strapped in so she got just pounded
*  And she was not treated. Well
*  You know, it's
*  Guys are gonna get the same. I mean bottom line you're gonna get raped if you're a male or a female
*  Really oh, yeah for sure and you get captured
*  Oh, yeah, you're going to for sure if you're a male or a female if you're a male or a female
*  You're you're not gonna have a good go of it for sure. And again, I'm not an exact expert on
*  What happened specifically with her but from my understanding she experienced that as well as all the other medical issues
*  But when we she was in bad shape when we pulled her out of the hospital for sure, but then so and I remember
*  There were two people with us that were carrying video cameras
*  and there was a little bit of footage that was taken from that like when she was in the hospital bed in the hospital and
*  A lot the rest of it was from the cameras on the helicopters and some you know, the sensors overhead
*  But the narrative from that not a word was said by anybody that was there executing that objective or from her and I think
*  my hypothesis is
*  You know, we were a month into that war a lot of that war was based on we need to go rid this country
*  And this dictator of their WMD is we hadn't
*  Found any from PR perspective wise it wasn't probably gone as well as they wanted it to do and they wanted to have a
*  PR victory
*  But the stuff that was said the stuff that made the news all this stuff that got blown out of proportion
*  None of that came from the people that were actually there. It came from all those layers on top
*  What was blown up because I'm trying to remember I remember some of the first reports
*  They were saying that she was gonna be the first female Medal of Honor
*  Reciprocating that she had fought until she had her, you know
*  She expended her last round and then was finally overtaken and he talked to her and she she never even loaded her weapon or weapon jam
*  She she never said that she fought, you know, I mean, I remember people talking about she never said any of that
*  What do you think was doing that was that the government's PR?
*  I think people are often in a rush to talk in an educated manner about things. They know nothing about
*  mmm, I
*  mean it takes time to to
*  Understand the details of what happened. She was not in a headspace to give a debrief, you know
*  She was literally being flown probably to Germany for her first round of countless surgeries
*  And she's gonna need to spend time with a therapist and a counselor
*  I would assume she would I'm say I can't speak for but you're gonna you know
*  They're gonna want to do a robust medical treatment
*  and that's really not the time to dive into the details of her exact actions and we left the next morning and
*  Flew into Baghdad like three days later, like it was just another day on the job and you were off and running
*  you just had it was cool because
*  It was the first rescue a US POW since World War two
*  And so the rescue of her was she was rescued from the hospital, right? And so they had
*  Abused her and then taken her to a hospital
*  I get a little grainy on the details of what happened in between the wreck and when we picked her up because there are conflicting
*  narratives there are there are I
*  don't know what the correct word would be stories or
*  There are reports that they attempted to put her into an ambulance and bring her back to US forces
*  But at that same time the Fedayeen were using ambulances as basically military fighting vehicles
*  So they said that when they tried to do that the ambulance was shot at which makes sense if there was a
*  Trend of people using an ambulance as a military vehicle that would make sense and they would get turned around
*  So they might have tried to bring her back
*  You know that hospital was being used as a Fedayeen staging point because they're I mean, they're not dumb people
*  They understand we're not gonna likely bomb hospitals or religious structures. So use them to their military advantage
*  Wow, and this is your second
*  Your your second real. Yep. Wow
*  Crazy
*  It's great. That mean that story was a giant story
*  Yeah in in the media about the war and people trying to sort out
*  What was true versus what was the you know, the publicity narrative?
*  I would say on average take 90% of what you hear off the top
*  90% yeah, you know is interesting for me when I was listening to you talk
*  With Trevor people are super fascinated by war in combat and I wish they wouldn't be because it's not fascinating
*  It's actually really simple most often
*  You're not out there reinventing the wheel you're doing the simplest of tactics that you can because they're almost always effective
*  You can build complexity, but you have to have a mastery of the simple first. It's not a crazy unique experience. It doesn't give you any
*  Insight or special powers, I mean it just doesn't make you unique. It's just a it's a bizarre occupation
*  But it's not to me at least it's not fascinating
*  And I wish other people were less fascinated by it because then they would be less likely to be taken advantage of
*  By people who are snake oil salesman. How so?
*  I mean you ever heard of stolen valor?
*  Yeah, and the shit that people try to pull you know when it goes that route and it's enticing in a wartime environment
*  You know the vast majority of the military doesn't see combat
*  I think 15% or less actually engages in direct combat
*  But you go to a bar and it's like how man there's a lot of combat vets in here like every single person in the military
*  Is telling war stories, you know and it's and and that is to a degree I would say harmless
*  Unless you start attaching your identity to that and you start leveraging people's
*  Fascination you know Ellie this oh look at this person look what he did. Let's have a relationship with that person
*  Let's give this person this and then they start you know
*  To me the biggest threat to the veteran community is veterans themselves getting so tied to
*  an
*  Occupation instead of trying to figure out who they are they get stuck in the rear-view mirror looking at what they used to do
*  You know because it is what you used to do
*  It's not who you are and people who can't disconnect those two things
*  I think that they struggle and you see guys looking for handouts
*  And then you know the more that you can create this dossier of who you are. It's amazing
*  I mean it opens doors it really does my background is
*  Is 100% that
*  Two-sided knife
*  It'll open doors and some of them
*  I'm not qualified to walk through but they will open it because of what they think or are fascinated by what I used to do
*  Well, it's fascinating for people because they'll never they're never gonna experience it. That's good
*  Yeah, I shouldn't I hope they never have to right but it's still you understand why that would be compelling
*  To at least try to understand it or process it in your mind for someone who isn't going to experience it like for me
*  Yeah, like when me when I talk to you or if I talk to Jocko or anybody that's had a lot of experience I
*  I am fascinated and I can understand why it would be something that you would want people to not be fascinated by
*  But for someone on the outside looking in like I wanted I want to know what that's because the only experience
*  that we can sort of
*  Absorb is film like we could either watch Rastrapo or watch you talked about this last time I was on
*  This is the only thing that and again strip 90% off the top. Yeah, I'm sure they're terrible. Yeah, it's yeah
*  And but at the same time
*  Other than a pure documentary films are there to make money. They're there to put butts in seats
*  So I get it
*  They're in this tug-of-war between entertainment and authenticity and I have a limited exposure to
*  Working in the entertainment world on the technical advising house and if there is a struggle often between entertainment and authenticity
*  Authenticity loses because it's not that fascinating. It's it's slower than people think it's quieter than people think
*  Isn't that the case with every single subject that they try to capture in film probably? Yeah
*  I mean, it's basically everything. Yeah from romance to fighting to everything
*  It's like it's a bullshit version of it
*  I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why so many people have these weird expectations of relationships
*  They watch too many Ryan Reynolds movies and they really think that this is how it's supposed to go down the notebook
*  These movies are really essentially what people use as a guideline for what the ideal relationship is
*  But instead of a really good relationship that you're aware of that actually exists. Yeah
*  I think people should use caution on anything that they
*  See on a screen of any size whether it's from iPhone to IMAX
*  Yeah, you just strip 90% off the top. Well, especially a screen where people are literally pretending
*  Yes, either pretending to be at war. I mean while this fucking camera guys there and actors and any cut good job
*  Okay, we're gonna have to touch up the blood. Okay, get a more blood
*  Let's spray some sweat on them. Yeah, they're talking to the VFX dude. Okay, we'll get that
*  You know where you get that explosion in the background give me an aircraft carrier going this way
*  I mean, how could you ever make that authentic?
*  What the what I think Trevor and I were talking about saving private Ryan and at the storm in the beach at Normandy
*  Yeah, probably the only scene ever in a movie that accurately represents what it must have been like at that time
*  Some of them get it right like snippets
*  I actually think we talked about this last time too briefly like black clock down gets a little bit right you can get an
*  understanding of like the
*  Confusion the the sense of losing utter and complete control not knowing what to do next having limited information
*  Having to make decisions on limited information
*  Having to make decisions where somebody might live and others might die like you don't get snippets of that
*  But I don't think there's any one film or TV show that captures it really accurately
*  Well, it's weird to me too when there's someone who you know
*  Like Marky Mark like here's Marky Mark. He's in the movie. It's Mark. Well, buddy whitey boy, but it's Mark
*  It's not Marcus Latrell, yeah, like I know Marcus that's not Marcus. Yep. That's Mark Wahlberg
*  Yeah, but he's playing Marcus. So it's like wow, this is weird. That's weird
*  That's inescapably weird when there's a person who's like a super famous guy like Mark Wahlberg who's been in a fucking million movies
*  But he's playing
*  Someone else but you know, it's Mark Wahlberg. So there's this weird sort of thing you're supposed to do
*  You know, this is a suspension of disbelief that you have in every movie
*  But look, it's gotta be the weirdest fucking thing ever to see someone who you know
*  Play you in a movie. I think I would just skip that whole process and be like hey, let me know how it goes
*  Just don't even watch I think it would be for me
*  I'd like first off nobody's ever write in a book or move about my life because again
*  exceptionally average military career wise if
*  They did I would say you go have fun and I'll let you know what I think of it
*  I wouldn't want to be involved in that at all. Yeah
*  So yeah, I think that's a good call
*  The whole the famous guy playing someone else
*  Thing is gotta be so fucking strange
*  If you're that person if you have an ex like Jessica Lynch
*  They said if they did the Jessica Lynch story and Scarlett Johansson played Jessica Lynch like what?
*  She'd probably like what in the fuck is going on? That's the
*  That'd be a mind fuck for sure yeah, yeah, well that's Scarlett Johansson that's on me what bitch I never said that
*  That is not how it went down what the fuck did they do to my story
*  Authenticity versus entertainment. Yeah, I mean that's just how it goes in every movie. Yeah, it's just
*  Foxcatcher is a perfect example of that. I've used that example many many times
*  That's not one of the mark and David Schultz documentary or film. It's with Steve Carell
*  and
*  who plays a
*  That handsome fella
*  Channing Taneum another one of them super handsome fella
*  he is a handsome place mark Schultz who was you know one of the greatest wrestlers America ever produced and
*  His brother Dave Schultz another equally impressive wrestlers just top of the food chain world champion wrestlers and
*  The the movie just distorted everything just twisted up everything about their career and and did they even need to no
*  Here's the the one example that I always use that I'm sorry if you've heard this before but the fucking end of the film
*  Mark Schultz in the movie has a UFC fight and in the real world
*  He had a UFC fight against Big Daddy Goodrich Big Daddy
*  Goodrich is a pioneer of MMA a famous fighter in the world of fighting
*  I mean, he's he's a legend right and Mark Schultz mounted him and beat his ass
*  Just a top of the food chain Olympic gold medalist wrestler just took him down at will just what you would expect
*  Yeah, and never fought again because he had a wrestling contract. He was coaching
*  I believe it Brigham Young and they didn't want him to do it
*  This is back in the early days the UFC to his bare knuckle the whole deal
*  But in the movie fights a Russian guy
*  Like why why do you have him fight a Russian guy when he fought Big Daddy Goodrich?
*  Gary Goodrich is a famous fighter. Yeah, he makes that call some fucking asshole
*  Because in the world, you know, I'm watching it. I'm like, that's not who we fought. Why did you change it?
*  Why did you change it when you could you could have just had a guy play Big Daddy Goodrich?
*  Yeah, and then have been like, oh, that's the guy playing Big Daddy Goodrich. Okay, at least they're not fucking me
*  But when I see this Russian guy standing there and then Mark Schultz gets in the cage to fight this Russian man
*  What are you doing? Why'd you do that?
*  Why did you change history? Did it ruin the movie for you?
*  Everything ruined the movie for me. Okay, so many things ruined before then but you stuck it out Steve
*  Carell was excellent and and Channing Tatum was excellent too
*  There were it was good acting in the movie, but I knew that a lot of what they were portraying was not accurate
*  You know, they're making it look like Mark Schultz was like down on his luck and not doing well as a wrestler
*  He was dominating. He was a fucking stud and then at the end of it just that there's so much that they just took so much
*  License for entertainment to twist up this real time of real world event. It's a real thing that happened
*  I mean that guy the
*  The fuck was his name?
*  DuPont did shoot Dave Schultz
*  He really did shoot him in murder me really was a fucking crazy man and Steve Carell did a great job of playing that guy
*  But they did so much Hollywood fuckery to a real story and that sucks because of people like if I watched that
*  I wouldn't know the backstory. Yeah, I would assume that that was to be an accurate portrayal of the history of it
*  Yes, and it would change the course of at least what I thought about it. Yes
*  There was a lot of weird stuff to them. They made it look like they were doing coke and they insinuated some
*  Freaky sexual stuff was like there's a lot of weirdness in that movie
*  Why are you doing this but it's just this is just Hollywood man
*  This is just what producers do, you know
*  They think they know better and they want to make something exciting and so they fuck with reality
*  To turn it into a based on an historical event or based on a real-world story
*  How you just described how you feel about those type of movies is exactly how I feel about them. Just a different genre
*  Yeah, I'm sure I mean but but even more
*  Insane right because it's it's war
*  Which is in the highest stakes that anybody can I mean when you come to if you're involved in any
*  very
*  Intense difficult encounter. I think war is the highest stakes the highest level of all those things
*  In terms of time and the time it takes to achieve the the end state for sure
*  Well, and also the results like what what what is happening? Well, it's people trying to kill other people
*  They're trying to kill you you're trying to kill them
*  You're trying to achieve a result and then the consequences of failure are devastated. Yeah, they're drastic
*  Yeah
*  But you know it allows you you can take those experience and do amazing positive things with them and Jaco is an example that I've
*  Got to with that
*  Not everything that happens in the military applies to the civilian world
*  But you just can't take a lot of the things that the military does and applying but some of the things you can do
*  Are the leadership lessons which shocker does I mean he's a freaking
*  Amazing at it at taking those lessons and applying them and talking about them in manners that people can adapt them. Hmm
*  but not all the experiences are that way, but
*  We should I think because people are fascinated with it
*  take what can improve society and so we don't have to relearn the lessons because
*  You know, I can't speak for Jaco obviously
*  But the things that he learned and he talked about in his books or continues to talk about
*  Those were taught to all of us instead of the military and then somebody taught the person who taught us like those have been passed
*  Along we need to spread the word a little bit farther and wider and that's what I'm saying
*  It opens some doors and we're qualified or I'm qualified to go in that door
*  But in other doors, I'm not qualified to go into mmm, but if they're all open and you have your choice
*  You know, you can get yourself in trouble
*  But I mean Jaco was one of the he's an example that I point to all the time of somebody who is taking those lessons that
*  People are fascinated by and recapsulating them in terms that they can apply in their everyday life
*  Yeah, there's certain human beings like him that are their fuel
*  Like you you can go to him and it'll change your state
*  Like you could go to Jaco's Instagram page and watch one of his videos and it'll enact a physical change in your state
*  And I'll go fucking I'm going to the gym and you literally will go do something
*  I'm getting my shit. I go the opposite. I see his watch. I'm gonna get the fuck out of my screen
*  I want to start a hashtag like up at a reasonable hour. I just want to fuck with it
*  For like a week. I was I was I would like wake up at 420 and like hashtag up before Jaco people got pissed
*  And they didn't realize that we know each other
*  Like I want to write a book, you know instead of extreme ownership. It's like extremely limited ownership
*  There's no bad leaders only bad teams will be chapter one
*  Other directions no bad audience is only bad comedians. Yeah. Yeah, I think Jaco is
*  It's interesting that people would get mad at you because he does have this profound effect on people know
*  Yeah, they're willing to defend him, you know, like but that's also you reading comments. You shouldn't be reading those
*  I sometimes I have idle time. I don't make good decisions always
*  Go to YouTube watch a fun video
*  Cats or something YouTube comments will that's is that the worst of the worst?
*  Yeah, that's the bottom of the pit because you got to realize who's leaving YouTube comments
*  You think Michael Jordan's out there leaving leaving YouTube comment?
*  No, was LeBron James take time between practices and leave YouTube comments. Probably not. No, it's failures for the most part
*  It's people with time or people that are at work and I fucking hate their job and they have free time where they can just
*  Leave comments and so many of them are toxic super judgy. I'm just basing it on what
*  I mean, there's reasonable comments. I've actually like there's some like
*  Technology is something I'm very fascinated by and I'll go to a technology YouTube page and
*  Watch like someone doing a review of say like a new
*  Linux
*  Laptop and then I'll go into the comments. There's no negativity. It's all nerds just talking about
*  Yeah different builds and you know and what they do
*  Coles and this and that and how they break this down and restore that and it's different
*  It's like for them. It's like this is just an area of expertise and fascination
*  Yeah, and but when it comes to social things, that's when things get wacky when it comes to political things
*  That's the grossest of the gross right anything involved in MAGA like just just you're not gonna learn anything from that
*  You're just gonna it gets a little Western in the comments for sure. Oh, it's just
*  Mutations. Yeah, it's just yeah, and this part of that. It's like these natural systems
*  That like this too much comfort too much idle time not enough
*  Stimulation not enough adversity not enough accomplishment and then a lot of access to information
*  Yes, and bitterness and angry and a keyboard that works and there they go off to the races
*  Just type it and fucking spew it out
*  Hey
*  I'll read it every now and then not mine
*  But I'll read other people's just to see what the fuck people are up to and it's disturbing as shit, man
*  What's crazy to me is when I see people responding in the comments to toxicity like what do you think you're gonna change people's minds?
*  It won't and what it actually does is let people know that you are paying attention
*  So it increases the toxicity in my experience from what I've seen. They're like, oh
*  Oh
*  He took the time to read the comment and reply. Yeah game on yeah game on yes, not good
*  Well, it's you're dealing with a specific type of person the type of person that's willing to leave a comment on the YouTube page
*  And it's just just the overall I can't say I've never left one
*  You've left them. I have left a comment on a YouTube page from time like in my earlier days. Oh you're young
*  Yeah, it was like last year
*  Mean stuff or no, I my policy on social media is that I will not I refuse to be mean
*  I won't name-call and oftentimes when people are being dicks
*  I'll just tell them thank you like you've definitely changed the way that I think about this
*  I appreciate you taking the time and effort for this well articulated thoughts just as fuck with them, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, and then they and then they twist into fucking orbit
*  That's true that that definitely can happen and that's the best time to walk away is after the nice
*  Thank you for your you know dickish comments let them twist in the void. Yeah, let them twist in the wind just like sorry
*  Yeah, I'm on it's just a weird thing man
*  I mean there's no way obviously to engage one-on-one in a physical way with all these people that are leaving comments
*  But if they did if you just sat down with these people and talked about it
*  It would be a very different sort of an engagement. It's just such a poor way to exchange information
*  They wouldn't say it to your face anyway, they would change the verbiage that they used face-to-face conversation there they're
*  emotionally heated
*  Again a lot of it
*  I put back to people letting their emotions drive their behavior in the way they communicate instead of detaching from that and being objective
*  which is easier to let the emotions do it when you're angry at a keyboard to be very hard to do face-to-face because
*  There's consequences to your emotional. There's consequences for sure, but there's also you realize what a cunt
*  You're being if you say something really mean to someone even if you say something mean to a small girl
*  This a hundred pound girl in front of you and you say something mean and you see her so that you feel bad unless you're a
*  Sociopath you know and then you know
*  There's issues with that as well
*  They're out there. They are out there man. I know if you
*  They I went to I went through buds with a sociopath the honor man of my buds class is still in jail for
*  Chopping people up and then disposing of their bodies with his wife really yeah, who are they chopping up?
*  I don't know the people but they would bring people back from I know it happened at least once it might have happened
*  multiple times
*  But they would go to bars find a couple
*  Continue the after-party afterwards elicit an argument
*  Some type of exchange they killed I believe was a man and a woman
*  Chopped him up he used to work at a grocery store chain, so he knew that they the
*  very cyclical
*  Removing of the garbage cans there they got you know sent to the landfill more often so he disposed of the body
*  bodies in
*  multiple
*  grocery store garbage dumpsters
*  And then they eventually got caught because in the middle of the night they broke into a Hooters to steal t-shirts
*  And got caught by the cops, and I believe it was in her purse
*  They found a spider-cone knife with like hair and like basically
*  Tissue still on the knife, and I think the woman's ID
*  Yeah, it's high-level criminal. They really thought this one through
*  And that's the only way they got caught that's how they got caught and imagine if they didn't break into Hooters
*  Yeah, oh of course well first off why the fuck are you breaking into Hooters for t-shirts knife you dirty bitch
*  But again, so this is you know sociopaths out there
*  And this is another thing that I try to tell people often the best people that I ever was around in my entire life
*  Was in the seal community and my mortal enemies and the worst people I've ever seen on the face of the earth
*  Was in the seal community as well. He was the honor man in my Bud's class which if I look back
*  It's they he had he had passed more evolutions from a statistical perspective than anybody else in the class. They weren't actually
*  Viewing him through the lens of is this person honorable or does he you know they weren't grading him by his integrity
*  But it just goes to show you that no selection process is perfect
*  And if you can't separate an individual from an occupation or a uniform or a black belt right
*  If you think that because you have a black belt that you're gonna be an awesome person or because somebody is a seal that you're gonna
*  Be a great person stand the fuck by
*  And it's not the norm right I'm not I'm not I don't want him as the anomaly to paint the norm
*  But it's important for people to remember that those people are out there and again they can leverage from my background
*  They can leverage the fascination the curiosity people wanting to give back
*  I mean one of the most common questions that I get from people is you know
*  How can I thank people for their service? I'm like well, hey just say thank you
*  And then my answer them is B is you know provide them an opportunity if you feel it's necessary
*  But don't allow them don't do anything for them and don't give them any special treatment make them earn it
*  Because then you can get a true look at the individual as opposed to perhaps just the shiny object that you were focusing on before
*  Interesting so treat them as an individual thank them but treat them as an individual and
*  Judge them based on the merits of their behavior and their worth 100% not off the merits of their background if you have a job
*  You know you like hey, I want to provide opportunities for veterans. No problem provide the opportunities for veterans
*  Opportunities for veterans no problem provide the opportunities for veterans
*  But treat them exactly like the person who is in the cubicle next to them if it's in that environment obviously
*  And if you hold the person that was a non veteran to a certain standard you better hold the veteran to the same standard
*  don't let them get away with anything because
*  It it doesn't help them either right you know it it it helps everybody in the organization
*  If you set the standard and make sure everybody holds it
*  It's insidious to an organization to set a standard and well
*  Why is this guy getting special treatment like what dude he was a seal gives a fuck it's just a job title
*  and if that person is
*  Sociopathic or they are you know there's a bell curve
*  There's a top 10% and the and and the the the top and the bottom 10% if he's in that bottom 10%
*  By holding him to that standard you're gonna get objective viewpoint of that as opposed to just being blinded by whatever it may be
*  It's interesting, but only you can say that or someone in your position can say that it's very difficult for someone
*  Non-veteran to say anything remotely close to that
*  Well, I hope they listen then because they don't need to say that they just need to if they need to just live that they need
*  To structure their organization with that framework, so it's objective not subjective
*  There's this like people look at being a seal. It's not a Harry Potter one. I have
*  Probably a familiarity and comfort with weapons and tactics more than your average person
*  But if I'm being completely honest about my old job I could teach a monkey to do most of the things that I did
*  I'm serious. I could teach a monkey to do the things that we did. It's not we're not out there doing
*  Nuclear physics you're out there doing you know we find an individual. How are we gonna get there? Okay?
*  Let's figure out how we're gonna get there. We train to those standards we get on target
*  everything is based on tactics and standard operating procedures or
*  TTPs tactics techniques and procedures and
*  Everybody is trained to those standards
*  So you know what to expect from somebody whether they're from an East Coast team or a West Coast team
*  You can meet in the middle and we all are taught to clear rooms the same way and it's just it's it's not
*  complicated
*  Actually the way to make us less effective and efficient would be to make it complicated the simpler that you can make it the better
*  You're gonna be mmm
*  That makes sense. I
*  Mean it makes but it's also
*  The mind of a seal like the type of person that can get through buds
*  That's that's complicated. That's complicated and just being able to control your mind
*  you know one of the things that you said in one of the one of times you talked about it was
*  Someone who's able to keep their world small more in Utah. Yeah
*  I'm like that's an interesting way of looking at it. Keep your world small like some people that applies to what's happening right now, too
*  Hmm. So what you're talking about, you know buds is a physical test
*  You're actually I would say having gone back as an instructor which I learned much more about
*  the process applying the curriculum as opposed to going through it because as a student you're just like ah
*  I want this day to be over as an instructor you can kind of and you also don't really know what you're gonna
*  Do the next day as a student as an instructor?
*  I can look at the entire curriculum in the story arc of where you start on day one and the product you're gonna get at
*  The end it's a physical test, but we're using the body to test the mind
*  We're stressing the body. We're gonna make you tired hungry
*  Hypothermic we're gonna get you so exhausted to the point that you're gonna hallucinate and then we're gonna take a look at how you behave
*  Do you value we over me?
*  You know one of the first things they do in buds
*  You're explaining the concept of a swim buddy and you don't get to go anywhere farther than six feet away from another human being for
*  That six month time period that is the opposite of most people's mentality and you can test it early on you yell at him
*  And you'll say hey you got 30 seconds to go run out to the ocean and get wet and in the first few days
*  They just take off and they start running because they forgot about their swim buddy. They're me centric
*  And so you bring them back and you punish them the individual that made that choice and then also the swim buddy
*  You know to reinforce that people there are consequences to other people from your behaviors and after about two weeks
*  You really can't separate people from their swim buddies
*  So it's a lesson and it's at a beginning point where you can instill this philosophy of we is greater than me
*  And it's one of the most beautiful things
*  I think from the seal community if you talk to people
*  Where my experience has been is in talking to people in their most dire moments where things are getting the worst
*  They're often more concerned about the people to their left and right than they are about themselves
*  My biggest fear probably I know what it was in the seal community
*  But to this day is that I am not gonna be there when somebody needs me
*  That was my biggest fear in the seal community that I wasn't gonna live up to this standard of the people to the left and right
*  Held at me and then they were gonna suffer for it
*  I was more concerned about letting them down than myself getting hurt or killed and that starts with that ethos from seal training
*  But it's not a complicated course. We're stressing the body
*  To stress the mind and if you look at the people who make it through so when I went back as an instructor
*  as a student when you're going through training if
*  Somebody next to you quits you never see them again
*  Like there's no hey, dude
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  Like they're just gone and you continue on with your day because you just want to graduate the program as an instructor
*  You can talk to those people and you can ask really important questions. My favorite question is why?
*  You said you this was your lifelong goal. This is all you've ever wanted to do
*  You left a
*  D1
*  Scholarship to come here because you saw no for yourself
*  No value in the higher education and you wanted to come to the seal community and you quit why?
*  Time and time and time again the answer I would get from the students is they got overwhelmed
*  So they were doing the opposite of keeping their world small because there's two ways you can look at buds
*  It's 180 days long. I think plus or minus one or two or
*  You could look at it as a sunrise and a sunset 180 times
*  So you could look at a pie and go oh my god
*  I have to eat this whole thing or you can look at a slice and
*  Eat the slice and not worry about the rest of slices and keep doing that and doing that until the training process is complete
*  Hell week is another good example
*  It starts Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon and you get about two hours of sleep on Wednesday. That's it. It's
*  horrendous to go through and it's pretty entertaining as an instructor because you can just totally fuck with the students because they're
*  Off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon
*  But almost all the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday morning and beyond that you're probably gonna make it through
*  Because you've invested so much but the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how weak as a five-day
*  pipeline
*  Just make it to your next meal. They have to feed you every six hours
*  So if I can stack six hours on six hours and six hours and just focus on getting to the next meal
*  Doesn't matter how much I'm in pain doesn't matter how cold I am if I can just get to the next meal
*  I'll get a reprieve a mental reset and I can continue on that's
*  that in combination with some
*  you know the mental toughness is
*  How you approach and set your goals and then resilience and my definition of resilience would be the ability to get bent and come
*  Back stronger than you were before the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible
*  Which
*  You do all the time by running sprints or you know, I mean you're doing that stuff
*  You're mentally tough because of that and if you can apply that resilience to approaching
*  Setting and approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can accomplish an insane amount. So
*  That's really what I mean, it's a physical test, but we're just testing the mind. Can the individual
*  Ignore the big and focus on the small
*  Can you do the step that you need to do and not get overwhelmed regardless if you're tired exhausted?
*  Hungry cold. I mean, that's really all it is. Mm-hmm. It's not a complex training program. There's the ocean
*  There's the beach. There's some telephone poles. There's some boats and then later on we introduced scuba gear and
*  Towards the tail end of it, you know some demolition and pistol and rifle
*  How many days can you stay awake for where it becomes dangerous for your health? Yeah, I don't know
*  It's dangerous for their health in hell week
*  What the students probably don't realize is there is a huge safety network for them
*  You don't see it as a student because you're so just tasks saturated. There are MDs walking around all over the place
*  There's people constantly, you know, we're checking the temperature of the water. We'll take core body temperatures on the students
*  We're keeping a very good eye and we're buffering them because by about Wednesday, they're brain dead
*  I don't know how long you could stay awake without
*  Suffering some severe physical consequences. They literally get two hours of sleep in the whole week
*  You might get a little bit of break time, you know, there's a it's actually on the wall at the Bud's compound
*  it pays to be a winner and
*  The inverse of that is incredibly true
*  It does not pay to be a loser in the seal community and for clarity loser is anything other than first place in the community
*  That I came from the podium has one platform not three
*  So if you win you might get 15 minutes off or hammering the shit out of the rest of the class
*  So if you win a task if you win a task like in hell week, you'll you sit by the ask such as
*  About boat crew race is a perfect one. I'm Jamie can pull up a picture
*  it's Bud's hell week boat crew race and there'll be students running with boats on their heads and
*  People get bald spots from it and we'll do races like hey
*  Take that boat that's supposed to be in the ocean and you're gonna run with it on your head as a crew of seven people
*  three people on each side and the leader in the back and
*  At the end of four miles, we'll be done with this the winning boat crew
*  Will we'll get a little break and the losing boat crews will get remedied four miles with a boat on your head
*  Yeah, you know why because it's fun to paddle it in the water and you can surf it. So fuck you
*  Yep, there you go. Yeah that look at that neck on that front right guy just
*  Yeah, he might have some disk issues later on in life, but they'll do short races
*  They'll do long ones and how much that boat way. Oh, that's a good question. Um
*  It looks inflatable. It is it's an IBS inflatable boat small, but still probably
*  150 200 pounds and then you gotta imagine sometimes there's water sloshing round in there
*  Sometimes I'll get sand in there because we do let him paddle
*  They'll do races where they have to run go out past the surf zone
*  Flip the boat over for no reason other than it's difficult and it forces them to get wet right the boat come back in
*  Continue the race
*  But so if you win that you might get you know
*  15 minutes while we're meeting in the class and we know what's gonna happen in that 15 minutes you see people sleeping standing up you
*  See people face down in a high-lick track in the sand sleeping. They're sitting there sleeping and it's kind of just a reward
*  You just leave him alone. So you let him sleep for 15 minutes. We'll give you a little bit
*  Yeah, then wake up bitch pretty much back to work get right back on that ocean Wow
*  Five days of that. Yeah. Hmm
*  And it's learned about people in that you learn a lot and you see people push to the point
*  Where do you care about me over we and we get rid of the people who cannot prioritize we over me?
*  Mmm
*  Damn arrogance comes out. You'll see it a lot in the
*  The leadership as well, you know, the students are largely the same like from a physiological perspective
*  There's ones that are faster runners and from a contractile potential like more
*  stamina or a cardio respiratory endurance
*  But most of them are the same that's like probably like a 3% difference between the students
*  But these little pods of seven people
*  Some of them can work together and they're just crushing it and other ones you'll see
*  You know, there's oars in the boat
*  So when they run their stuff on the top and you'll see they'll be out paddling and then you'll just see a sword fight start
*  With people just knocking each other's heads off with oars. Oh fuck. Yeah, because look, I mean imagine how exhausted you are
*  You are so exposed in raw
*  so suppressed as a human being like from all the physical tools that we have that the real person comes out and
*  Sometimes boat crews will just eject a person they will hate that person so much because they're they might be selfish or arrogant or they're not pulling
*  Their weight and they will just harp on that person or beat the shit out of the person
*  Eventually, they'll end up quitting now when they do get in a sword fight. What do you do?
*  Do you kick them out if they get in sword fights or do you let them sort it out?
*  I'm gonna let them sort it out. Wow, plus they're out in the water and I'm not going out there a
*  Lot of the times you're watching it through binos
*  It seems like that's one of those things that once you get through and once you get through buds and once you get through
*  How weak and once you get through all the difficult physical tasks and you actually become a seal how many people?
*  Maintain that sort of Goggins jocco
*  Level of discipline and keep training constantly and how many people do the bare minimum? It's hard to say
*  There are people who slip what are the requirements once you once you've gone through all that shit
*  There's very few and I can only speak from when I was in in 2013
*  I left last day of June of 2013. So if it has changed since then I don't know anything about it
*  But you know the Navy obviously it's you're a Navy SEAL. So you're governed by the United States Navy
*  they make you do a PRT a physical readiness test, which is
*  running pull-ups push-ups sit-ups and a swim I think because we're seals and
*  Your wife could meet the standards my 11 year old daughter could probably meet that they're not crazy is what I'm saying
*  so the bar if
*  You trip over the bar at that point like you you know, your hamstrings don't work or you know, just you suck
*  It but there are varying levels
*  There are people who are very like the individuals that you're talking about and then there are others that will
*  Let it slip and they slip a percentage point over time
*  there's some
*  You know
*  Obese
*  Disgustingly overweight seals not many
*  And everything in between so it'd be hard for me to give you like exact numbers on that
*  I would say more guys trend towards the Jocko Goggins realm
*  Because it's a very self critiquing community in most ways
*  It's like working inside of a piranha tank and if there's a drop of blood and they're just like yes, I'll eat you now
*  We're very hard on each other for sure
*  Now how much how many of them are involved in martial arts?
*  Again hard to say because I know it has drastically changed since I was in the amount of
*  So I was telling before I sat down with Henner
*  Gracie yesterday and we were just talking about a lot about his interaction with law enforcement and how they got started and it was
*  With the Rodney King riots actually I didn't know that but that's when they started interfacing with law enforcement. Yeah
*  he had his
*  Dad
*  The generation before him they started sitting on a panel, you know talking about I think essentially combatives with the
*  Hand-on-hand type stuff with the LAPD. That's but that's where it started and it's grown since then when I went through
*  I
*  Don't remember much discussion of martial arts at all. There was
*  prisoner handling or you know detaining people and cuffing them the terminating point would be to get their hands behind their back and
*  Flex cuff them. We didn't use metal handcuffs
*  We would use tie ties, you know, just because there you can put a lot you can slide them in your gear and just easily
*  cinch on them, but
*  I think that it has drastically changed since I have been in and I think a lot of that though is driven by individuals
*  I mean, I'm sure you see it. I mean, I feel so stupid being late to the game to jujitsu
*  And I know that it is definitely I want to say invading all of those communities, but it might be a good term
*  Infecting it's just it's there's a groundswell from guys who are learning on their own
*  So it's increasing but it was not prevalent when I was in unless you were an individual practitioner
*  Doing it on your own or had a buddy that would do it with you
*  Really? That's interesting
*  I would have assumed that it would have been a core part of training like from the beginning just to build character and to
*  Understand what happens if you do lose your gun or if you do are in a situation where you don't have a weapon
*  Well, there's not a lot of situations in real life that you can point back to from my community where that has happened and quite
*  Frankly ego gets into the way and you'll hear guys say things like well, why do I need to?
*  Bro, I don't need to go hands-on with anybody. This is all I got right here, right and that's purely just ego and
*  What ends up happening is is in I was talking with the hentor about this yesterday and I have a much better understanding of it now
*  You can elicit actions from people if you don't know what you're doing if you do have to go hands-on and you're trying
*  To detain somebody but you're asking about how much I weighed right how much gear I had
*  So I'm they usually would float somewhere between 205 to 215 when I was in
*  So add 80 to 90 pounds on top of that and now I'm kneeling on your back
*  Right and but I don't understand weight distribution. I don't understand leverage
*  I don't understand the way that the joints move that well and you're trying to comply but I'm applying so much weight to you
*  That it's forcing you towards a fight-or-flight
*  situation and you can you can
*  Increase the deadly deadliness of these situations
*  Unintentionally and get yourself into a position where you might have to take somebody's life, but they didn't deserve it
*  It was actually your fault because you drove them to that point because you were not
*  Judicious judiciously applying the pressure that you needed to well
*  You see that with police when you watch videos of cops trying to detain suspects and then they lose control
*  Situation and it's purely because they don't have an understanding of how to control a person. They run out of tools
*  I have a ton of empathy for law enforcement
*  If you're out on the streets and you have verbal commands and then a taser and maybe a pepper sprays in there somewhere
*  I don't even know if they still use that but then your next resource is a gun and you rapidly go through all those options
*  I understand how those situations occur and I'm not trying to justify them in any way whatsoever
*  But I understand what happens when you reach the limits of your tools and you're left with what you think is a life-threatening
*  situation and there are some great videos of breaking down what goes wrong with
*  Police when they're trying to detain someone I mean, it's oftentimes two and three on one and they wind up getting killed
*  There's there's videos of guys having a suspect on the ground and a suspect who's not trained in martial arts
*  Yeah
*  but unfortunately the cops aren't either and they're doing these stupid things and hitting this person and trying to control them and then the
*  Guy gets out gets to his car pulls out a gun and kills them and I've watched a video like that recently
*  so the guy who got me into jujitsu was a sheriff and I
*  Actually just the only reason I started is because I wanted him to shut up. I had known him for like a year
*  He's like kind of jujitsu
*  And for me, it's like the harder you push that at me. I'm like, I'm not doing it ever. I don't care
*  Oh, you like carrot cake. I'm never having a piece of carrot cake. I will not have a piece
*  So we're at my house drunk
*  Downstairs at the bar and he was like, you know
*  We're standing there drinking he tried to put me like a standing head and arm. He's like, this is how I would choke
*  He was like if you start right now, you'll never tap me. He was a four stripe white belt at the time
*  Got his blue belt shortly after oh, that's hilarious. If you start right now, you'll never tap me. So he claims he didn't say this
*  he said it so I went to a class like the next day and
*  And
*  And fell in love with it and he got pulled into and started jujitsu because a buddy of his got into a damn year
*  Life or death fight where I live up in Kalispell
*  Sheriff's department doesn't have that many people on shift and a response time of 20 to 30 minutes is possible for sure
*  So this guy goes out he's in the fight for his life and like two feet of snow in the wintertime
*  Oh Jesus, and I think one of the first things that happened was his radio got ripped off
*  That's a fucking problem, right? If you need to call for backup
*  Fortunately, they have procedures like I guess if you check in and then for a certain period of time
*  Like if you don't people start moving their car on the right direction start coming to you
*  If you don't check in at a longer period of time, you know the lights and sirens come on. So other people came
*  He was okay, and he just got his brown belt. Not too long. He's a savage. What so what happened to him the
*  Obviously, I wasn't there but it was he pulled somebody over for a particular reason. I don't know what it was and
*  This is an interesting thing too that I've come to understand better
*  Developing friendships with law enforcement, you know
*  They they come up to a car and they're just they're doing a stop and it's another touch point for their day
*  But somebody in a car might be in the back of their mind thinking oh my god
*  Like I have a misdemeanor or felony. I might be going to prison for the rest of my life
*  So two very different head spaces as they converge in this instance
*  I believe there's a pistol that was in between the driver's seat and the little center console
*  Individual went for it
*  somehow they came out of the car and it just became a scuffle at that point and they fought until other cops arrived and
*  Basically dog piled on the person and ended it
*  And it was over. I believe they were at that for like 10 to 15 minutes
*  She's and for people who don't understand how hard it is to go that hard for 10 or 15 minutes
*  I mean fuck well if they weren't in shape and that guy was that would have been death
*  So he
*  Found jujitsu, he just got his brown belt
*  He's awesome, but he started my buddy who made that comment and then I have started they'll do defensive tactic stuff
*  I've helped him out twice where I'll just go and I'll be a role player and I'll just you know
*  Lay there on the ground and put my hands underneath my chest and they have to try to cuff me and it's an eye-opening
*  Experience. I mean I've been at this for 18 months. I'll be the first to tell you I don't know shit
*  I'm at the point now where I'm starting to realize how little I actually know you blew belt now
*  Correct. Yeah
*  and it's it's like a foreign language like I can kind of see a little bit of the alphabet but don't even think for a
*  Second that I'm trying to put together words yet, let alone sentences
*  and so I'll go and you know, I did I was the role player for two of those and
*  It was interesting I saw some of the same stuff where you can elicit responses for people like I was I was resisting
*  But not a crazy amount and the amount of pressure that they started to like applying to me
*  Grabbing fingers and pulling my fingers back
*  It it almost to me. I like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would so they're without that
*  Skill or without that tool in their tool belt
*  You run out of options. Mm-hmm. And it's they mean they have a dangerous job very at it as it is
*  and
*  So after doing that defensive tactics, it's actually why I created this shirt
*  Well, is that sure as a street blast gym so national SPG is where I train
*  Yeah, it's founded by Matt Thornton and my coach was Travis Davis and he was here the last time SPG as in Ireland
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah having awesome with the coaches
*  But so where did it start?
*  Matt Thornton started it. He got his black belt from Chris Howder. Okay, Chris Howard is a Machado guy, correct? Yeah, so when
*  Hegan Machado, I believe howder Matt and then my coach Travis who you met the last time I was on
*  is the owner of the SPGs, but you talk to these guys and we you know, we do this session and
*  You can see that their eyes are kind of wide like what the fuck just happened
*  and then the next thing I want to know is about cost and
*  Travis does an awesome job and I think it's SPG wide
*  They will give a discount for law enforcement
*  But I feel like it's so important for them and I want them to be better at doing their job for my family
*  So I literally just made this shirt and
*  Every penny that goes from the sale of the shirt
*  I'm gonna start doing scholarships not all the way for the guys because they need to have some skin in the game
*  But I want to get as many law enforcement and first responders on the mats as possible. So I want to lower
*  the cost working with Travis and the SPG organization to start with to just get people in the door
*  Because I mean, you know this probably better name, but like you don't actually have to know that much
*  To radically increase your safety, especially if you're dealing with somebody who doesn't know shit
*  Yeah, the average blue belt could manhandle the average human. Yes
*  Yeah
*  Imagine if every police officer or first responder had that ability whether it comes to deal because you know
*  These guys are not dealing with people. It's not like hey Joe. It's great to see you today. Nobody calls 9-1-1
*  It's like, oh my god. Let me tell you about the most awesome day that I just had. Are you ready for this?
*  Fuck it was my birthday. We had a party. There was a cake the presents were amazing
*  No, it's like oh my they're going to Christ's right. They're dealing with drunk people
*  They're dealing with people who are on drugs and I don't want to see anybody get hurt or killed specifically them
*  So I want to have more tools and I don't want them to have an economic
*  Buffer you do that. So trying to raise as much or not raise as much money
*  But so as many sure it's possible and then go all that money towards scholarshiping those guys. That's all the organization. I love it. That's awesome
*  Yeah, yeah, I think all martial arts. I mean, I think they should learn striking for sure
*  Yep, but I think that out of all martial arts jujitsu for a law enforcement officer
*  It's probably the most important because the struggle for a gun the struggle for you know
*  Getting a hold of someone pulling a gun and being able to control their arm and getting a hold of them. It's so critical
*  Well, you can stop stuff early to even just a simple arm drag
*  Yeah, but you can write you can see people's body language. You're like, oh, okay, you don't know shit this or
*  This is about to get a little I'll pull it back
*  Yeah, or you see you assume them you see people start to dance clench their fence, right?
*  Like you can see those behaviors and a simple arm drag where you can step behind and control the other arm like for a law enforcement
*  Officer to understand that concept be able to do that right you're already in control
*  Yeah, whereas if you don't you see the guy and the next thing you know, you're in a boxing match
*  It's like I don't know
*  Maybe you were a Golden Gloves boxer and maybe your teeth are gonna get fucking knocked out and you're gonna get a knock your family's
*  Gonna get a knock on the door. Yeah
*  Easily. Yeah. Yeah. I always try to tell people you know what for every law enforcement
*  Video that you see where things went wrong when someone was a piece of shit and some cop did something horribly abusive
*  You got to think of the millions of interactions that cops have with people don't go that way daily
*  Yeah, you're looking at it's a it's a you're getting a very biased
*  perspective of what it's like to be a law enforcement officer and then on top of that
*  I'm a big supporter of law enforcement always have been because I'm a person who understands the necessity
*  I understand what like what a lawless world would look like and
*  People only want to look at the cops that have done poorly
*  But it's like what you were talking about with seals with anything the bottom 10% the top 10%
*  There's there's a there's a certain type of person that's a police officer. There shouldn't be a cop
*  They just shouldn't be a cop and a lot of times
*  Those are the ones you're seeing in these situations and also a lot of times when you're looking at these videos
*  You're looking at someone who's got severe PTSD
*  untreated
*  Disrespected that they they they're encountering every day they're encountering liars and thieves and at any moment
*  They're pulling somebody over and they could lose their life at any moment
*  They're looking at this car and it's got tinted windows. They don't know who's in the backseat
*  They're like fuck
*  Is there a shotgun pointed at my face right now and you don't know the headspace of the person that you're like I've said
*  It's so interesting to me to hear them. They're like, hey man, I want to go home at the end of the day
*  This is my job. Yeah, like I have a family I have kids I work for 12 hours 10 hour shift
*  Yeah, I'm not trying to ruin anybody's life. But you know, I saw somebody swerving across the road
*  It's my job and obligation to pull them over
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on in that person's head and then those two things can combine and it's like, yeah
*  It's a tough world
*  I have nothing I have a ton of empathy for people who operate in that world and if you've never had to make decisions
*  Like that in time compressed environments, it's hard to describe
*  Yeah, and I was driving on the street once in LA and there was a billboard when they were trying to hire
*  police officers and they were they were touting how much money you get paid and
*  I remember thinking looking at that billboard that is one of the worst
*  pieces of
*  Motivation like if that's your motivation to be a police officer
*  Look, you can get thirty five thousand dollars a year to start like hey, get out now
*  Get out now because if you don't truly love the idea being a law enforcement officer
*  You're not truly in love with that like and you're just saying oh, this is a good way to make fifty grand a year like
*  There's better ways to make fifty grand a year. They aren't gonna have a risk to your life on a daily
*  Yeah hourly
*  Minute-by-minute basis what you would want is everyone who's doing it to want to do good for the community and want to make the world
*  A better place that's ideal
*  you know and then you get varying levels in between that and
*  The the people that are just doing it because they don't have another way to make fifty grand a year
*  Yeah, yeah, it's and then it's kind of the same as military too, you know, the military is a stable paycheck
*  But if you're coming to the military for the money, you're probably better off doing a shorter
*  Tenure or tour if you want to stay for longer and you want to dive deep it
*  probably at least from my
*  Opinion would be that you need to have some
*  Sense of purpose or calling that is coming from that occupation as well because you're not you're not gonna get rich
*  Right in the military for sure what you get out of that though. The one thing that I notice from military folks and just from
*  Whether it's team guys or just just people that have
*  There's a little the level of discipline that I know that you have
*  You know if you if you've had a successful career in the military, particularly if you're a team guy
*  There's a level of disciplines that you have that gives me comfort like I know this guy's got a shit together
*  I have selective discipline. Mmm. Yeah, but you could turn it on up at a reasonable
*  You can turn it on like there's something there's something about
*  Wanting to sleep late just to say fuck you that's kind of appealing as well
*  There's the the guy that gets up at 430 every fucking morning like Jaco. It's possessed. It's understandable
*  He's got a demon in his head, you're not you're not putting that fire out with regular water
*  Yeah, but there's a the discipline is the big thing man
*  The only thing that makes you successful in the military because the military and I think this is a reason why some people will struggle when
*  They get out the military is a very task centric organization
*  They will set for you parameters left and right boundaries and they'll say if you want to get to
*  XYZ you're starting at a these are the things that you have to do
*  The people who are efficient at traveling from a to Z are the ones who are disciplined to take that next step
*  They keep the world small
*  They focus on the breadcrumb in front of them and you once you do that and can understand that concept
*  You can you can apply it to any aspect of your life
*  Well get some guys and it got me too when you get out you're like, well, who's gonna give me the task?
*  Right. Well who's told me what needs to be done, right and the and the answer is you so you see guys
*  They're just wildly entrepreneurial because they'll find something they're passionate about and then they apply that same concept
*  I'm just continuing to go forward
*  They'll have micro failures, but they don't allow micro failures to impact macro outcomes, right?
*  Because it's again small versus large. Yeah
*  And you'll see them bounce around and they it is largely that discipline and it's there's no secret recipe
*  To it. It's like people again Chaco's hilarious this people like Chaco
*  What should I do to eat better and his response will be better
*  He answers their rhetorical question with a portion of the rhetorical question
*  Yeah, Chaco, how do I clean up my diet clean up your diet? Like well, there's not rocket surgery
*  What's going on with people is that they just want to talk
*  They just want to talk about it. Yeah, they want to talk about it. Like wait, how should I get going?
*  What should I do? Like what's a good way to do it?
*  And you can give them a little bit of advice like my advice is always write things down that you want to do
*  What do you want to do? Well, right write yourself down a schedule every day
*  I write yourself down a scale
*  I mean you might have to adjust it based on time constraints and but if you just write down today
*  I'm gonna run four miles. I'm gonna do 500 push-ups. I'm gonna do a thousand sit-ups
*  I'm gonna do this and that and that and this and then check it off
*  Do those things if you if you could just write shit down and make sure you do it every goddamn day
*  Write down what you have to do that day. It's amazing what you can accomplish
*  My list would have none of those things on there
*  Four miles ever I think I ran four miles last year
*  Well, you fucked up your hip and getting shot and you really that's part about getting shot. No running
*  Can you run like?
*  Distances and stuff or is it you still have nerve damage?
*  Yeah, my leg is I have the neuropathic damage is gonna be there forever. I can run my gate is a little bit messed up
*  So then I have like weird compensatory issues. That'd be a real issue for joints as well, right? It's not smart
*  Maybe yeah people
*  Let's just say I'm one of my ankles
*  I can tolerate a foot lock a lot better than the other one and people I'm just looking at them and they're just like
*  Mike yeah, I'm good
*  But is it because you can't feel it? Oh, yeah, it's totally fucking the end
*  Yeah, but it's good. You make eye contact with them and you can see they're just like I don't feel comfortable cranking on this more
*  You know what I got into man when I I suffered this
*  insufficiency fracture
*  With I got enough a fall skiing which is my oh my fucking hate skiing I ski because my family likes to ski
*  This is me skiing don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt didn't get hurt. All right
*  Let's do it again, but this time I got hurt this fucking lady
*  She was a noob and she didn't know what she was doing
*  She slid she could she was on this little side hill trying to put her skis on and she just weee
*  Right into the trail right when I was coming around a corner and I was like, I'm gonna kill this lady
*  I got a I got to wipe out and I wiped out crack my fucking head
*  But slam my knee really hard and I knew something was wrong and I went got it checked and I did an MRI and it's
*  Actually a fracture in the shin bone. So I got great. So doctors like you can't run for six weeks
*  So I got into stair mills
*  Stair mill those fucking things that just keep going staircase dude. I didn't think those would be that hard
*  I believe you know people like stairway to heaven. No, that's the stairway to hell
*  Turn that bitch up to 15 and good luck with you. Good luck with you. It's a
*  And the beautiful thing about it is it's zero impact. You're just stepping
*  It's you're just stepping and goddamn what ferocious cardio you can get out of those things
*  Yeah, throw a weight vest on that's what I'm talking about or you know, they have this
*  Atlas pack that the outdoorsman's outdoorsman's comics. Have you seen one of those? It's the one you put the plate on the back
*  Yeah, that's the shit because you can get 90 pounds on that motherfucker
*  Put
*  Very well, it doesn't it slop around on exactly like a like a real it's a rucksack. It's a military rucksack frame
*  Exactly. It's perfect because the frame is for pack. It's a there the outdoorsman's make an excellent hunting frame a pack
*  It's like a really sturdy pack that I learned about from Remy Warren and Steve Rinell and these guys just swear by this this one
*  Backpack frame because it's like super sturdy and it's just excellent for packing out like elk like, you know
*  You've got to pack out an elk before. Yeah, you don't know what weight is until you're going uphill with a fucking leg on your back
*  You know with a back with no backpack with no frame. Yeah get some of that party. Good luck with that
*  Yeah, the difference between a backpack with a frame like a really melt like a kefaro a really well-made
*  outdoor
*  Eccentric backpack versus some bullshit backpack that's just designed to have like a laptop in it
*  And you're trying to carry shit around in that
*  Yeah
*  There's a big difference and just the just the way the the loading shelf is and the way that
*  Straps in and the angle that it's supposed to sit on your back. There's all science to it
*  So with these outdoorsman's frames you get like the best aspects of an outdoor pack
*  But you have this big ass post on the back just like a Olympic bar
*  You slide those plates on it and clamp it down and all sits perfect
*  You get an insane workout with one of those on one of those stair mills
*  Oh, yeah, it'll change if your normal workout is without that and you just start start light people
*  It'll it does some amazing things for sure. Did you at any point in time?
*  Consider using her as a jump instead of wrecking
*  No catch some sweet air. I couldn't I was turning the corner. She was right there. I was so quick
*  I had a wipe I was gonna kill her I was like I don't think hit her killer
*  I was going pretty quick. You could have gone up and done like the little skis to the side. Ha I'm not good at that
*  I'm not very good at skiing. I'm competent at skiing, but I was like, I mean I wasn't gonna kill her
*  But I would have maybe broke her leg. Yeah, you know, I mean I want to break some ladies leg
*  I was just coming around this corner and I see her I see this I don't have control thing
*  Fuck she's going and then I see kids this way. I'm like, I can't go that way shit and it's just time to go down
*  My head was the weird one. Are you wearing a helmet? Yeah, but I was dizzy for the rest of the day
*  I was like a little out of it. I was like, well, I got my bell rung
*  Concussion you think ah for sure something happened. Yeah, cuz it was a bang
*  It was it was a hard-packed snow and my legs went up and my head went down
*  It was a big bang I have a strong neck fortunately
*  So there wasn't as much rattle as could have been. Yeah, and I kind of knew it was coming, you know
*  But I was I was my bell was rung for sure and then
*  Because I was a little dizzy afterwards
*  I went to I was with my 11 year old and we were going on to the ski lift and I just I was out of it
*  You know the things come around yep, and I timed it wrong like fuck I went too soon
*  I'm stuck and I'm like, I can't go I fell down and this lady had to help me get back up
*  Yes out of it. I was just like not quite there. Yeah, it's very embarrassing. He suffered a head injury. Yeah, I definitely did
*  But it was only like for the day the day I was just a little out of it
*  But the next day I was fine. I was I woke up prepared for the headache
*  There was no you know, like this post post sparring headache that I used to get all the time
*  I got my bell rung pretty good. I think about a month ago actually on the mats
*  I was climbing on a guy's back. It was a good lesson for me, too
*  I was slip over the top
*  No
*  I got both of my hands involved and he rolled and snapped my head into the mat and I did have a chase planted
*  But I and I didn't again, I don't know shit
*  so I'm learning it's a mistake that I haven't made since then but
*  Yeah
*  I had my hooks in and was kind of just getting too involved in that drastic movement and it was a full
*  Whack in the same thing in the headache for a few days afterwards
*  Doos get wild when they they try to get out of things and that that's a particularly dangerous move
*  When someone's on your back and you decide to yeah slam them into the ground. It's kind of a dickhead move really
*  Well, it would have been okay if I had had at least one post
*  But like I said, I was I wasn't thinking about that that wasn't easy standing. Did he try no he was turtled. Oh
*  I don't think I would crawl on somebody's back if they were standing
*  I think it's not very advanced you guys your background it you would probably your jujitsu is probably different than mine
*  But even taking someone's back
*  Standing is tricky as fuck because they can just throw themselves backwards and on concrete. Oh, that's a game over
*  It's a death sentence
*  I mean, that's what I actually thought about that afterwards because you will see people who you know
*  I'm here because I want to learn to protect myself in the street
*  And if I had done that on the street and had my head cracked on concrete
*  I've either been waking up in the hospital or not at all
*  You got to kick their legs out in those situations if you have someone's back and you're standing you got a you got a mean
*  The the options that exist that don't exist in jujitsu
*  One of them is you kick their fucking legs out if you have someone's back, you know, you actually kick their leg
*  You don't just just jump on them with the hooks in on concrete
*  It's just too dangerous before you get to that position
*  You want to yank them and do something trip them do something to get rid of their base, but someone who's strong
*  That's so dangerous because someone who's strong can carry you on their back and then just throw themselves backwards
*  I mean even hardwood floor anything or even against the building or a car
*  Anything anything you want to get them to the ground you want to get them to the ground or a standing guillotine?
*  When you're in a front position something that's another one that's really fucking dangerous man
*  Yeah guys have gone for
*  takedowns with guillotines
*  I say a guy shoots in with it with for a takedown and a guy grabs a guillotine and
*  Pulls back and then this guy's head is the first thing that hits the ground
*  Yes, okay a guy on team alpha male on your I favors team wind up getting paralyzed for life that way
*  Yeah in training on the mat
*  Yeah
*  yeah in training shoots in for the takedown and the guy gets him in a guillotine and
*  They all all their weight together falls on this guy's head and his neck compresses and his neck breaks
*  And he loses his his ability to move for the rest of his life. It's um that's a common one in fact
*  That's not common, but it's happened multiple times that I'm aware of and you know you gotta imagine on the street
*  You know someone tries to take you down on the street and and you elevate and go into a guillotine position
*  And they fall down and slam their fucking head first. You're gonna crack it open probably too
*  Yeah, it's just there's so many I mean
*  one thing that is a good criticism about jujitsu is the lack of takedowns and
*  That is a real factor in any sort of real-world situation
*  The hope is if you're in a bar something like that, there's a scramble most things wind up on the ground. That's true
*  Until you deal with a skilled opponent
*  And if you deal with a skilled opponent who has takedown defense and then you're stuck in the situation where oh hey now
*  You're in a realm where you're a white belt and this guy's a black belt like if someone is a problem a wrestler who can strike
*  It's a terrible position to be in and we saw that with a lot of in the early UFC's in particular a lot of jujitsu
*  Black belts just didn't have takedowns and then they would get involved with a wrestler
*  Who would easily stuff their takedown and the wrestler was a better striker and those guys got fucked up
*  You had imagine that'd be a quick bout. It's not good
*  I mean the only thing a lot of guys did was they would follow their back and try to pull guard and try to
*  Entice a guy into coming to their back and then they would kick off their back like those
*  Hickson use those those tactics when he fought Funaki and up kicks
*  Yeah, and he actually wound up fucking up Funaki's knee
*  By kicking at his knee
*  Hyper-extending his knee from his back rugged. Yeah, that's a common common technique
*  You know guys standing over you and you're on your back posting up you hyper extend his knee
*  It's just like judo is the best in my opinion for someone who's wearing clothes
*  you know, I think every jujitsu guy would really greatly benefit from having a
*  Good comprehensive knowledge of judo. How deep would you go?
*  Judo is a good thing to learn man. Just period first of all, those guys are so freaky chimps strong
*  some of the freakiest champ strong guys ever roll with were judo people because judo players man, they're just all
*  Everything is constantly this they're constantly grabbing and everything is
*  Is so much explosive movement carrying a human body. It's right. So they're doing
*  Explosive movement like sandbag training with another 200 pound person all the time or or larger particularly women like Rhonda
*  Rousey, you know goddamn strong that woman is she
*  Freakishly strong. No, I bet because she her whole body was designed to you know, throw bodies around
*  Throw a human body. I mean, it's like you think of weightlifting, right?
*  Like when are you ever weightlifting your whole body?
*  Well, maybe if you're squatting or maybe if you're bench pressing if you're exceptionally strong or deadlifting
*  Yeah, or deadlifting those are like the compound movements but like curling or triceps and none of those things
*  Overhead press very rarely you using your whole body weight that way
*  I don't think it's advisable to do that with that whole body and
*  Your whole body weight is way more difficult to control because it's moving and resisting and yeah
*  It's you know, try picking up a dead body a person who's out cold. It's fucking hard
*  You got a scoot a person your wig if I had to pick up a dude is 195 pounds and I'd pick him up
*  And he's out cold fuck that's hard. You know put 80 pounds of gear on. Yes
*  I could only imagine and guns dangling all over the place. So the judo player imagine that but imagine that person also
*  Resisting, you know, like they're some of the freakiest strongest people in the world. I
*  Just sit down when I start with judo people. I'm like, haha
*  Yeah, good move good move I watched them over in the corner and I hear just what?
*  Okay, I'm gonna sit down. It's a beautiful thing to learn though
*  It's a beautiful thing to learn if you can get someone that'll that'll
*  Really work with you and who's technique oriented not someone who just wants you to spar all the time because one of the things that
*  Happens with judo a lot when people are just getting involved in it
*  There's a lot of scrambling on the feet that could put your legs in a compromised position when your knee blows out
*  How much?
*  Isn't your time watching the UFC? How many of the takedowns do you see your judo based?
*  It's not that often but some guys are really good at it and the guys that are really good at it
*  It comes up, you know, there's there's there's some guys
*  Back when Cairo Parisian was fighting. Caro was a great judo player who was in the early
*  Earlier days of the successful UFC was one of the better judo guys and he would hit
*  He would hit hip tosses and all kinds of different judo throws all the time and Ronda of course
*  You would do it all the time too
*  But with Ronda that was basically the only way she would take you down was with like upper body grabs
*  She'd grab shoot her move was like to grab with grab the head and then take people down
*  With that and and use judo, but it does happen, but it only happened, you know, it happens with skilled players
*  Yeah, but when it does happen it's like it's a it's a big surprise oftentimes like whoa
*  One those people are the anomaly to not the norm
*  I mean, they're two trained fighters at the apex of their sport
*  Yeah, you know somebody with a moderate level or understanding of judo is probably not gonna have that difficulty in a bar
*  Right. Yeah, right. Well nor is a wrestler
*  Yeah, you know, I mean just and again with wrestling
*  See, I always say that if if a kid wants to learn martial arts
*  Like there's a lot of good things they should learn but one of the things they should learn first is wrestling because it sucks
*  So hard it sucks so hard. It'll teach you whether or not you really want to fight whether you really want to compete
*  Yeah, you know, I've heard horror stories
*  Actually Calvin last night was telling horror stories of wrestling and wrestling can't cashmere shirts on
*  Yeah, you know I'm I need to determine whether or not he was talking about his experience
*  Other people's experience or he was making up every goddamn thing. He was saying it's hard to tell. Yeah, he sells it
*  He sells it so well though that I don't even care because it's so entertaining. He definitely could wrestle
*  Yeah, I got count involved in jujitsu in
*  96
*  But I stuck with it. Yeah, and he did not sort of drifted in and out and he told the story last night
*  We know basically why he stopped he was watching
*  I think it was he said Hanzo was giving a you know, basically a
*  Little bit of a deeper dive onto a finer refinement of a tee
*  Technique, you know instead of having your hand in this direction, you know rotate it the other way
*  And he said he just stood there and realized I just don't care anymore
*  Well, Calvin is one of those guys that gets into things for a little bit and then bales on it
*  He's like the same thing. Oh his garage that never once you gave him a free bow
*  I know he showed it to me the last time I was down. He's never been drawn it back
*  I think it's so it might have the plastic on the string so you can't draw it back
*  He
*  Come over and learn
*  He was telling me last night. He's like I need a tactical shotgun. I was like
*  Callan what makes a shotgun tactical he's like the ability to go boom boom boom boom boom boom
*  He's like but I need a short barrel but seven and he's like seven rounds and I'm gonna use birdshot
*  I was like fuck man. This is getting worse
*  He's like birdshots what I need right bird shot'll do I'm like
*  Birdshots great for birds
*  But so he basically wants a huge shotgun with like a huge magazine tube
*  But a barrel that sits two feet back from the magazine tube, so he'll just bounce stuff
*  Yeah, the the trajectory of Callan and I with hunting it shows like the difference between us as humans
*  In 2012 we both went hunting for the first time. Yeah, and since then the only time he's gone hunting is with me
*  And since then he's killed
*  Well he killed a deer with me and then
*  I'm assuming rifle. I think that's it. Yeah, I think that's it. We went turkey hunting
*  I got one he struck out we went blacktail hunting on
*  Prince of Wales in Alaska we both struck out and then we got
*  We had a we had a bail a day early because of a storm coming in we're gonna get trapped
*  That was the most miserable trip ever, but it was really educational wasn't that an immediate or show? Yeah, I watched that one
*  Yeah, you guys you guys were like hey we can get a plane in right now
*  Well, we were about to get stuck and I had gigs
*  I was like I can't cancel gigs and this is fun and everything but there's a real possibility
*  I might not be able to get out of here. You guys didn't see shit
*  I'm shit way we saw a couple deer and we saw they saw some black bear. It was just it was
*  Strategically the wrong time to be in that area, but it was very educational
*  What was educational is about how good the Sun felt when I came back like it's always sunny in LA
*  But I called Ronella up when I got back and I was like dude
*  I have never been happier than today
*  Like I know it was miserable up there because you think one of the things that was like it wasn't that bad
*  But what was what sucked is there's no dry there was no dry there's never dry you thought well
*  I'll be in the tent. I'll be dry. No, there's no dry
*  I got up to take a piss one night and I turn on my headlamp and all I could see inside the tent was water
*  Vapor just just droplets and I was like, oh, there's no dry. No and that's getting into every
*  Fiber yeah everything every night tent. I had a wet sleeping bag, which is adorable. Yeah, what sleeping bags are adorable?
*  Why have this on yeah, I hate the water I would not go there
*  But it was fun. It was fun. The camaraderie was fun
*  It's always fun being with Callan and the meat eater guys
*  They were great and we did wind up starting a fire one night with Fritos, you know
*  Fritos are excellent fire starters the chips. Yeah. Yeah, those greasy little fucking cunty chips those things off
*  Those things are fucking delightful very delicious, right? Like I said, I have selective discipline
*  They stay lit for a long ass time you just light them with a lighter. Yeah. Yeah, they stay lit for a long time
*  It's kind of crazy. And so there's a little is the truth
*  One of the guys that worked there
*  So someone knew it someone knew it and then we let the Cheetos or the Fritos rather and the the Fritos lit these little
*  Twins are delightful Cheetos are cunty
*  Cheetos are not as good as Fritos
*  They look good because they're big and fluffy and then but it's so much
*  Before you get to the real there's like air in them they're bullshit. I think they're delightful
*  No, no, no
*  Cheetos Cheetos. Yes. I'm on those are bullshit. Oh, yeah, there's much air
*  Yeah, Fritos you're that's an honest snack and you can use like a spoon if you get the party size. That's true
*  Yes, you can and you can also lose use them to start a fire
*  So we lit the Fritos and then we put the twigs over the Fritos
*  We got a little fire going we were so pumped because everything was soaking wet
*  So then we started like looking for areas that were less wet, you know
*  Like under law or you know, like on the backside of trees
*  We carved some bark off of those and then we got some wet logs and put it close to that to try to dry it
*  off but eventually we got to we had a whole day like from like maybe like three in the afternoon to like
*  You know three or four in the morning where's no rain, which is crazy
*  It never happens up there the rainiest place in North America and we actually got a fire going it was fun
*  But then when I got back home I remember thinking man, this is why you have to suffer
*  Because I feel so good like I've never feel this good about California
*  Like usually the rain the Sun is just always there you just take it for granted
*  But this day I was like, ah the way I felt on my face. It's like I was on a happy drug
*  I was like I felt so good and I called him up and I go dude
*  I've never been happier in my life
*  I think that's one of the things that you really have to get into those valleys to appreciate to really hit those peaks
*  I think that's what's going on right now as you're saying that I'm thinking about like literally what's happening in this country
*  And I hope that you know, we get to the point where we see the Sun and we feel it
*  But then we have to also not forget. I think you're 100% right
*  I think we have it really really easy in this country what you're saying about
*  This is the reality of third world countries or places where I mean you're under a military
*  Dictatorship where you can't get food. You can't travel wherever you want to you
*  Don't have the freedom to move about whenever you want to and we're in this weird situation here today in California
*  they've put this lockdown on everybody where
*  supposedly until
*  April 19th, you can't have a gathering of more than 10 people and you're all essential businesses are supposed to be closed like
*  Well fucking good luck with that. Yeah, good luck. Good luck
*  Good luck with a whole month of telling people they can't work. This is crazy
*  I had a experience that stuck with me that that I use
*  As like a lens of context from overseas and it was from Afghanistan. I was in a sniper overwatch position
*  and I was
*  Watching a I was on one side of the valley
*  There was a unit on the other side of the valley and there was a village in between and I watched an individual come out
*  in the morning
*  To the only water source in the valley small stream
*  And watched him just take a shit in the water
*  Oh Jesus Christ and then later on in the day another person came out and
*  downstream of that took a bath in the water and
*  Later on in the day a woman came out with two kids and got their drinking water
*  Downstream from both of those things and went back to their house and it's like, okay
*  We have it really really good really really really really good and in that village there was probably a light bulb
*  Why did he take a shit in the river?
*  Maybe he didn't have any toilet paper because the grocery store was out. I
*  Just wanted to watch that's why not. Yeah, I mean, oh so that's the thing about people that's this
*  Willingness to do something that you know is gonna negatively impact others, but you don't care because in the moment
*  It's good for you. Like when you see someone throwing a cigarette out the window of their car
*  That's a perfect example that they don't want that cigarette in their car. So they just say oh somebody else will handle it
*  Yeah, but if you see enough of those things are in that it reframes the way that you look at what people complain about
*  hmm, and
*  I mean I thought about that day very often because in that short period of time. It's just like I
*  Don't ever really have that much to complain about like what's gonna go on right now for the next few months
*  I would guess maybe the rest of the year is gonna be horrendous and I hope that
*  Everybody makes it out. Okay on the other side
*  But the reality is people are gonna die and it's gonna suck and it's gonna destroy families and there's the economic destruction
*  Will probably be worse than the physical destruction from a death side of the house
*  But we're still gonna be okay at the end of that and even as if it gets horrendous here
*  We are doing so much better than
*  So many other people on the face of this earth their daily best is not gonna even approach what it's gonna look like at our
*  Worst as we navigate our way through this my biggest concern is not just the deaths, which is a big concern
*  Not just the financial crisis, which is also a big concern
*  But it's also the government gobbling up freedoms in in exchange for the illusion of safety. That's a real concern
*  It's been happening for a long time though. Yeah, but it's it's also whenever there's a real crisis
*  There's always an excuse to pass legislation that diminishes our rights
*  I mean, it's just it makes it easier for them makes it easier for them to do what they perceive to be their job
*  Only if people are scared. Yeah, it's you know, because they're finding the seams in people's attention span there instead of being objective
*  They're being emotional and that clouds your vision and it clouds your judgment and when they're not paying attention because they're scared because they're online all goddamn day
*  Looking at people taking pictures of the empty toilet paper aisle in the grocery store
*  Other people who might have malicious intent are moving on that man and nobody is paying attention to it
*  Yeah, that's where a lot of people that the more
*  What's the best way to say I'm trying not to use the word retarded
*  Conspiratorially minded that don't think very well. The first term was accurate. Yeah, they think of it in terms of a
*  Gigantic conspiracy and this is all set up. No people take advantage of moments. Yeah, and that's the difference
*  That's what really happens where there's moments where they can pass something like the Patriot Act or the Patriot Act to
*  They do it. It's not because they've set this up to pass that no
*  They use it as an opportunity
*  because they know the people are scared and they use it as an opportunity to further diminish our rights because it makes it easier for
*  Them to control us and that's a that's a real concern right now
*  It's a real concern right now and it's something that people go. Oh, that's the last thing you should be thinking about
*  No, it's one of the things you should be thinking about
*  There's many things you should be thinking about right now besides your safety and your health and not spreading a disease and making sure you wash
*  Your hands and stay away from old people and maintain social distance. All that stuff is important. But also recognize what the fuck these
*  career
*  politicians and these these career lawmakers and these career
*  People that are in charge of controlling mass groups of people any laws that help you any rights that help you
*  It makes their job more difficult
*  Yeah, that's something to be concerned with right now. I think fear is totally natural
*  I think if you don't experience fear you might trend towards the sociopathic side of the spectrum
*  But it's totally natural it should be expected but you have a choice and how you
*  receive what is going on and you can allow the fear to cloud your judgment and drive your decision-making process or you can can
*  Recognize that the fear of something, you know fear of death overseas isn't what keeps you alive
*  Objective analytical thought process and doing the things that need to be done keep you alive
*  Regardless of how scared you are or fearful you are. That's what keeps you alive
*  It's okay to be scared. But just don't let it just don't let it take over. Yeah and control you
*  What the fuck is going on in Russia right now? Are they getting this? I
*  Haven't heard a goddamn peep about either actually. That's a good question. I haven't heard a goddamn peep about
*  Russia
*  Like there's
*  Very little discussion about whether or not they've gotten it. I know that it exists in Korea. I know they've got it in South Korea
*  I've seen the maps where they color code it, you know, the circular. I'm it's gotta be coronavirus
*  Russia doctors say government is covering up cases
*  Of course they are well, this is what we have to really worry about with a with a dictatorship, right? That's one when when
*  What would be the benefit of doing that what would be the benefit of covering it up superiority want to claim superiority over the Western world
*  False superiority because at some point the scales are gonna tip and it'll hit a point where you can't cover it up
*  Yeah, but that's part of their whole long game. Their whole game is about superiority and propaganda. It's a big part of what they do
*  I mean they're they're
*  Gross domestic product is so small
*  Their GDP is that of a very small European country and yet we look at them as look at that number of
*  Coronavirus cases in Russia not good. Oh
*  There okay, they got plenty
*  253 cases. Oh
*  Only one deaf did that but that's them saying that yeah, the fuck do we know because we've had over a hundred deaths now
*  Right. There's a hundred deaths in this country. I believe and I still think that those numbers are incredibly low
*  I think a lot of people are probably dealing if you look at how they describe the symptoms
*  I bet a lot of people have already dealt with it and don't even realize it
*  I think that's absolutely true. You look at Idris Elba
*  How many people are like that guy who are fit and got no idea tested then?
*  I think he got exposure to someone else who had it and so he felt that to be a responsible person to be precautionary
*  Self-quarantine and test himself and he turned out to be positive
*  But you know, he's updating everybody on a daily basis on Twitter
*  He was concerned also because he has a pre-existing condition he has asthma, okay, even though he's a stud
*  Yes, you know that guy had a Muay Thai fight
*  No, he did. It's fucking good, too. He's good. Hey fought his ass off. I think he won
*  I think he won a decision. It's good fight though. I watched it on YouTube. Yeah, he trained Muay Thai for this can be reason
*  Yeah, yeah, why was the movie star? Shut the fuck up? Yeah
*  He's an animal. I love that guy. I love awesome big fan
*  You gotta assume that there are other people though out there who have no idea yes just rolling around
*  That's why that made I bet the numbers are way higher
*  But the ratios are probably similar well a lot of those NBA players that tested positive for it show no signs
*  But you're dealing with super athletes right with the incredible bodies of low-risk
*  Super healthy individuals in the prime of their athletic peak, you know, here he is right here training
*  Dude he's I mean this is not a good example here because this is just him tired hitting the pads, but he's got skills
*  There's a video of his fight, but you can see him here hitting the bag
*  Not bad, I mean he's you know, he's no fucking
*  Giorgio Petrosian. Yeah, he's not doing it professionally. Yeah, he's but he's fit and he's you know, he's got skills
*  He does everything correct. He's holding his hands up. What's on his left?
*  Discipline once he got there on that left ankle. It's taped up probably fucked up his his shin sparring
*  And so he probably put some heavy pads on it probably fucked up his ankle, you know
*  Like you kick elbows a lot. Have you done much striking?
*  Striking training see his knees me zero zero. Yeah, you kick a lot of elbows man
*  You know, I broke kick a lot of elbows. Yeah accidentally there he is right here. Look at his fighting. This is him fighting
*  There's a there's good video of it. It's a real fight. It just elbow it was for a documentary, right?
*  So it's Thailand so
*  He he did a lot of training in Thailand by the way while he's a fucking huge movie star
*  You know and their shorts are so unacceptable
*  Yeah, you could see him getting better as he was doing it, but he's he's doing like legit sparring
*  You know getting thrown down the whole deal. I didn't know you could throw somebody down if you caught their foot like that
*  Oh Thailand, it's a huge thing in Thai boxing. That's a big part of the the sport is
*  throws not just throwing someone from that position
*  but just throws
*  You know, they'll they grab each other by the head and throw each other to the ground sweeps catching the leg
*  look, he's like here he is man, he's in his fucking 40s to by the way when he did this and
*  Decided to train and actually have a real fight. Let's see some of the footage of the fight
*  It was a pretty good fight and the guy fought man was not playing games with him
*  The guy fought was trying to fuck him up. I
*  Got nothing but respect for people who willingly step into that arena
*  I know but it's just so rare to see someone who's a bonafide movie star that's willing to do this
*  He's a bad dude man. It probably says a lot about his character
*  I mean, yeah ready for that is not it's not a stroll down the beach. No, no
*  According to all who trained with him. I mean the guy
*  Trained as as diligently and as hard as anyone that's a professional fighter
*  He just really went after it and really took it and took the approach of
*  Like that this is a life lesson and he's going to go at it with a hundred percent of his being and I just
*  I'm a big fan of this guy
*  I'm a big fan of him as an actor
*  But when I found this out and I watched this I was like, okay
*  This guy's a real fucking deal and there's very few people that would do this when you're absorbing those knees and those kicks to the high
*  Leg what what's walking like the next day? I feel it's terrible
*  even just training when you get hit with
*  With pads on someone has like big-ass shin pads and they they dig a shin into your thigh
*  It just gives in man. Everything just like long is horrible like a charlie horse times a hundred
*  But then think of someone who can really kick, you know
*  Yeah
*  Think of someone who can book really fucking turn their body and turn their weight into it
*  You know
*  I've had people ask me to kick them in the leg and I'm like, dude
*  I'm not kicking you in the leg cuz if I kick in your leg, I might break your fucking leg
*  Why would somebody ever ask first off drunk and he would be silly people being silly silly gooses
*  Just kick him one time in the legs. Don't do a full blast. I'm like if I'm kicking him
*  I'm kicking you full blast. This is you asked
*  Just cuz you asked cuz you're so fucking stupid
*  But like I'm not gonna do that. I could tear your knee apart like if you think it's fun. It's not fun
*  No, thanks
*  It says the shin bone is such a nasty bone too
*  It's really kind of designed for slamming into the meat of a thigh
*  Just think it's got a blade to it, you know
*  And if someone's good at it and they're chopping either chopping up or chopping down with that
*  It it cuts your muscle in half. It like pushes
*  It's like that the edge of the shin just separates that muscle tissue. It makes my stomach hurt. Listen to you describe that
*  It's terrible. We had a fighter who fought on the last UFC
*  The one in Vegas and he in one of his fights his last fight he had something called
*  Compartment syndrome they pull up the card. Let me tell you who this guy is pull up the car for the last UFC
*  I was gonna pull it up on my phone the last UFC that was in Vegas
*  There was one of the gentleman that was fighting on the undercard who has a scar that goes from the top of his thigh
*  All the way down below his knee. Yeah, you found it beautiful put that up on the screen
*  So this is from one of his fights do I not want to look at this?
*  Yeah, look at the screen look at the screen. So this yeah, that was the tissue in his leg
*  That's a tube to drain it. Everything had gone gray and he was in real danger of losing his leg
*  Austin Hubbard, right? Is that that's the gentleman's name, right?
*  Yeah, okay. Go back to go back to the image of his thigh, please
*  So John annex showed it to me during the broadcast I was like, holy fuck like I had heard that gray is live
*  Well, yes look like live muscle down tissue, but all of that is from absorbing shins
*  So punishing shins to his thigh had made his legs swell up to double the size that it normally is and
*  Then caused like this horrible condition called compartment syndrome
*  I believe that's how you say it and so they had to open up his leg and yeah compartment syndrome is what it is
*  I had never heard of that before and I've seen a lot of I mean I would imagine it's probably similar to what Uriah
*  Faber had when he fought Jose Aldo
*  Did you ever see that fight?
*  No, Uriah favor versus Jose Aldo was the worst punishment
*  I've ever seen anybody take to their thigh and Uriah you're right. I took the punishment
*  yes fighting Jose Aldo when Jose was in his prime and
*  He tortured Uriah's left leg so badly that Uriah
*  Documented the post fight and then recovery of it
*  I mean his leg had turned to this horrific shade of purple doubled in size and
*  You know, he was he wasn't the same person for months
*  Can you get rabda from that too from the muscle tissue breaking down and entering the bloodstream? That's a good question
*  You I don't know what you get. It's not whatever it is. It's not good
*  You're I don't think you're I got compartment syndrome because he didn't have to get cut open like Austin Hubbard did but you think
*  It's fairly rare in terms of the amount of fighters that we see fight. I mean I've seen
*  Thousands of fights I've only seen one person have that injury to the extent that Austin Hubbard had it where he had to get
*  The slice down the middle of his thigh. I take it you're I lost that fight. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, but man what heart he showed because most people would have quit
*  He was so punished his leg was so horrific see you can get a
*  Image of Uriah Faber's leg post Jose Aldo fight. It was crazy
*  How bad it was and he just kept eating those leg kicks that was when Aldo was in his prime
*  His leg kicks were so fast. It's one of the weird things about him today because he's still he's only 32 believe it or not Aldo
*  That's Uriah's thigh afterwards. Oh
*  My yeah, well that's long afterwards that's long afterwards
*  I mean that's him many weeks later, but like right post fight
*  There's a bunch of images that he shared on social media go. Yeah, that's what it looked like like look at his leg
*  Look at that leg. I mean that is fucking crazy
*  Look at his calf. I mean it looks like a fucking linebackers calf
*  That's just all swollen with blood and pus and it's from Aldo just destroying that leg
*  Amazing
*  Just amazing how tough he is that he endured that you guys can have that cage shit
*  It's fucking Muay Thai and that shit is just the worst punishment on your legs
*  Yeah, I enjoy watching it, but I know thanks much like the ocean no
*  Yeah, it's a smart way to look at it. I don't know how we got into compartment syndrome. Oh
*  Idris Elba. Yeah coronavirus. Yeah the fact that he's yeah, he's uniquely fit and tough guy
*  but this thing about the shin if someone just does it gently like John Jones did it gently to
*  Jim Norton my friend Jim Norton has had is a series of
*  fighters who've done things to him like put him in chokeholds and arm bars and
*  Leg kicked him and also because he asked him to do it and gently just jelly just jelly jelly
*  Don't don't kill me too hard and John just kind of thumps him just gives him a little thump
*  Nothing like what John's capable of just a little thump
*  It's it's fucking horrific it's horrific just folds him over
*  Yeah
*  there's a guy named Pedro Hizzo and he used to fight in the UFC in the heavyweight division and he fought Randy Couture and
*  Randy Couture's leg was so fucked up from that fight that it took him six months to recover
*  Six months to recover from the leg kicks
*  He was the he's the hardest kicker I've ever seen in all my years of watching people kick legs
*  I saw Pedro kick the bag at Beverly Hills jiu-jitsu in like the late 90s
*  I was there I forget what I was there for and
*  Pedro was just happened to be doing a workout on the bag and this is like the early days of
*  Big gyms in Los Angeles. There wasn't a lot of them
*  There was Hickson's place and then Horian had the Gracie and Torrance and then there was Beverly Hills jiu-jitsu
*  It was like this kind of high-end
*  Mix martial arts place they were putting together and Pedro was there training and there was this
*  You know 150 pound heavy bag and Pedro leg kicks this thing just
*  And I watched this bag bend in half and he does it again
*  And I just thought like oh my god
*  It's a natural trunks legs huge legs and perfect technique and Marco who asked watch this. This is Pedro watch this guy watch this
*  But look how he digs into it
*  Do it from the beginning again
*  Is that the beginning look at this thump?
*  Pedro has the hardest leg kicks of ever seen in all my years of watching my man did a full 360 rotation
*  He went flying through the air. Yeah, like you literally lifted that guy powerful mustache Dan Severin
*  Yeah, and Pedro would just fuck people's legs. Oh, he stopped Dan
*  On that oh, yeah, I'm sure he did fuck. I'm sure he did he blew everybody's knee out Pedro was a monster
*  The monster with the leg kicks man, oh
*  Look at that. He just fucked people
*  He he fought Rico Rodriguez and I remember he leg kicked him once and you see the look on Rico's face
*  Like fuck this so every time he came close to doing that
*  Rico would just just drop to his back and try to submit him a Pedro was a
*  Devastating kicker just fucking devastating one of the best. I'm not a fan of the speedos
*  I just I'm glad that it's beyond that. Yeah, that was an early Brazilian thing
*  They used to fight with speedos. I'm not exactly sure why I can't think of a single reason why that would make sense to me
*  To fight another man and grab I think that's what the idea was less thing to grab
*  I'm gonna accept some more handles for people to grab onto and rolling around in fucking grape smugglers
*  Yeah, there's something about those that are particularly offensive, right?
*  Like a girl wearing a bikini bottom is not offensive at all
*  But a guy wearing a speedo is very offensive like why is it seeing more of a man's thighs is gross?
*  Have no answer for that. It is
*  Yeah
*  If I see a guy on the beach and a speedo I judge him you better have a French accent motherfucker
*  You better be from a country that doesn't know any better if you're American
*  Yeah, you better been raised wearing those things if we went to the beach and Dudley showed up in speedos
*  I'd be like hey fuckface. What are you doing? Yeah, I would have a serious talk with him. I'd be like, are you okay?
*  Yeah, you live in Iowa, bro. Yeah, you can't be wearing speedos. Where'd you get that?
*  You have a midlife crisis you want to tell me about yeah, we'd have a chat
*  We're gonna do it if you're gonna roll in speedos wear a fucking thong
*  Let's go hard go hard grab onto well. Have you ever seen the Thai cups Thai steel cups?
*  What's interesting is they stills for some strange reason. I'm pretty sure
*  Please Google this our Thai steel cups still allowed in MMA
*  I know Kenny Florian throughout his career as a fighter wore a Thai cup. Is this what you're describing?
*  Made out of metal it's a cup made out of metal
*  So the ties it's a very uncomfortable setup, right?
*  And what they do is they take this Thai cup and they tie it on and it's tied on the side
*  It's not a jockstrap because ties aren't playing games rope like cinching. Yes cinching up your asshole
*  G-string style deep into your asshole so that after your fight is on you're you've got a bunch of torn tissue up there
*  I mean you're gonna have some problems. That's how you do it
*  Yeah, if you're gonna do it do it like that clamp that bitch in there locked down
*  And if you get kicked in the nuts wearing those Thai cups the guy who kicks you is the one that's hurt
*  Yeah, yeah, and if you're not gonna wear that and you want to get the mental advantage wear the thong but on backwards
*  It's not just that but in jiu-jitsu
*  It's a spectacular leverage point like if you there's this hump a steel hump where your dick is right?
*  And if you get an arm bar there, oh
*  Yes, my friend Amir Amir renovati
*  Rolled with him once and he mounted me and
*  Drove his dick into my chest with his steel tie cup and I was like fuck
*  And he's like yeah, that's why I wear it I was like wow
*  I never even thought of that because instead of that position being just a bad position to be in
*  Now it was really fucking painful few people can say they've tapped to a dick
*  I didn't tap to it, but it was hurt. I talked to something else. Here's the deal though. I bet some people have oh, yeah
*  You would tap to it
*  Yeah, if you didn't know what the fuck you're doing for sure like if some guy got on top of you and those your first rodeo
*  Yeah, he's got a tie cup on and he's literally in your sternum especially if they're skilled. They know how to apply pressure
*  Yes
*  Today was painful and I was like oh
*  But it opened up a door. I was like well of course
*  But then we were talking about leverage points and I was like well a leverage point like for I don't I believe they're illegal in
*  IB JJ
*  tournaments and a lot of jujitsu tournaments because of the fact that it creates this fulcrum because why would you wear a cup when you roll though
*  Anyway, if it's just I got my dick busted once I wear a cup when I roll
*  I wear yeah diamond MMA cup diamond MMA makes these amazing. I'll get you one you should wear it
*  My friend Einstein did it shout out to Einstein Scott Epstein he's the
*  Instructor at 10th Planet West LA it's not he wasn't his fault
*  It was just a thing that happened
*  He was trying to pass my guard and he was trying to slice his knee through and he landed
*  Firmly on my dick and I didn't have a cup and so I I thought everything it hurt
*  But we kept going and blah blah blah the end of the workout. I went to the locker room and my jock strap was filled with blood
*  I
*  Was like well, that's not good
*  And so I peed and all this blood came out and that's not good and then but my dick didn't hurt that bad
*  So I was like, okay
*  Do I go to the doctor or do I treat it like my nose?
*  So I treated it like my nose good call because if my nose is bleeding I was like, yeah
*  Yeah, it happens all the time
*  I'm gonna treat it like my nose at least for a little bit before I have to go to the dock and say I broke
*  My dick so I decided well, let's see if it still works. So I went home and jerked off and the one
*  So when I went home and jerked off it was like you ever get an egg and there's like kind of like a half
*  A chicken in that egg. Yeah, it's like blood and like chaos
*  That's what the load looked like. I was like, well, it still works, but that's not supposed to look like that
*  So I said, let's let's touch and go. Let's see what it's like in the morning and in the morning
*  It's like my dick just seemed normal. It seemed fine. I peed in the morning. There wasn't any blood anymore
*  So I kept an eye on it that eventually I didn't do anything, but I was I was super concerned
*  But I immediately went and got a really good cup and
*  Doesn't change the way you roll it all. No, I feel like it'd be uncomfortable. No, no, it doesn't you don't even notice it
*  Okay, you don't even notice it
*  My favorite of the diamonds because the diamond MMA cup is a compression. It's a cup that curves under so it goes like to the taint
*  But it's in compression shorts
*  So it's really snug down and it's designed that way and if there's a there's a he gave me a bunch of them to give
*  Them away. So I have one for you. Who do we give one away to recently? We gave one to somebody that was here
*  doom guy oh
*  Hugo Hugo Martin who was one of the shout out to Hugo who was the creator one of the creators of doom?
*  Eternals this new amazing video game is gonna ruin my life
*  The best I could find is this here shall wear a groin protector of their own selection as type proved by the commissioner
*  Yeah, see so it doesn't say yeah, you have to but that's MMA. That's okay. I thought this was the IB JJ
*  Yeah, see since male mixed martial artist shall wear. Okay now
*  Or other type approved by the commissioner the commissioners may say you can't wear a steel one
*  But Kenny Florian throughout his whole career wore a steel tie cup cut to
*  Jiu-jitsu bit diabetes. Yes says you can't do that. Yes, you can't okay there it goes
*  Cannot be fashioned of hard material that we cause harm to a prominent out
*  Okay, see that's why because the steel cup is a significant advantage if you get into a position you're in an armbar position
*  It's like doing an armbar over a rock. I was gonna say it seemed like it would supercharge any
*  Yes, it has a big effect
*  It's really good
*  But Kenny said that he'd never had to worry about getting kicked in the nuts because it always hurt the opponent
*  Oh, yeah hurt him and then tie fighters
*  I mean you think the way ties kick they kiss big kick better than anybody on the planet and they're always throwing leg kicks
*  So the odd the possibility of kicking the nuts is always there
*  So with them that tie steel cup was imperative and they went for function over comfort
*  So the tie cup is just not a good time
*  Side-tracked answer the previous question to okay in France
*  Swimming loose fitting trunks are not allowed to be worried by men
*  Have to wear a tight fitting
*  Who is the governing body on this fashion?
*  I guess I don't know they want to see the outline. It's super creepy. Don't want to see what you're smuggling
*  Really that yeah, and he told me yes, I checked but who's enforcing this I don't know someone me sure me sure
*  Yeah, your shorts are too loose
*  What do you have in your shorts?
*  But that's probably why James Bond's always wearing Speedos and not I guess but any British
*  I bet he's hanging out in like
*  It's true he's just complying with the local laws
*  True, I guess yeah. Mmm. Good point
*  Google tie steel cup yeah, I need to so you can see what this bad boy is now
*  I don't recommend this for rolling because I think it's rude to your training partners
*  But like I said my friend Amir he fucking opened my eyes to it because I never thought about that way
*  Oh, see, that's what it looks like when it's fully leather because it's oh, that's a diamond one
*  So that's the one that I use that's the shit and like I said
*  I'm gonna give you one before you you leave here. You'll you'll you'll swear by it
*  Just one good dick injury and you're gonna go okay, this is not worth it. And again, I was doing jujitsu for probably
*  12 there it is. That's a tie steel cup
*  I was doing jujitsu for probably 12 years before I had this dick injury
*  So it's not that common so that bottom strap of the old tie right through the right through the crack
*  Thank you not comfortable I'm sure it sucks but
*  It's I think in a tie fight, it's probably mandatory or yeah that might be good in a gunfight too
*  It might'll ricochet some of those. Yeah. Yeah, right if someone wants kicking the nuts and they're just hitting metal
*  No, thank you. Yeah. Well, that's what Kenny said Kenny said listen if somebody kicks me in the nuts, it's bad for them
*  Makes sense probably wouldn't do twice
*  Yeah
*  I mean you rarely see nut shots in tie fights and I really think that's probably a big part of it is because they know
*  there's a fucking
*  Steel cup there just a barrier plus in a fight like that. I don't think a nut shot's necessarily gonna end it do you
*  Well nut shots can do terrible damage
*  There was a guy that fought in the UFC Brian Green and in sparring one time
*  He decided to not wear a cup
*  I think it was like just the last couple rounds of sparring and he just said look
*  I'm just gonna go lie to whatever some guy kicked him his nuts and his nut exploded. So he lost one of his testicles
*  You got to think of how hard a person can kick, you know
*  Think about a guy like style bender kicking you in the nuts
*  Think about it, you know like a real good kickboxer kicking you and it hit that little mushy little organ that makes
*  All the gist against something hard flatten it and splatter it and it can never heal
*  Yeah, they explode man. Your balls can explode not good, you know
*  So that's what happened to this one gentleman who was a professional fighter. He was a militant guy
*  I'm pretty sure and lost a ball
*  What do you think is gonna happen with professional fighting as this goes on in what way with the UFC?
*  Yeah, the cards that they have lined up do they're gonna fight on a battleship
*  They're gonna take Khabib and Tony and put him in international waters and helicopter everybody in I don't know honestly
*  I don't know they can't have the crowds. No, they can't have crowds not for a while
*  I mean this fight is supposed to take place April 18th
*  That's not that far from now. Where is it supposed to take place supposed to be in Brooklyn, but it's not gonna be in Brooklyn
*  They've already shut that down. Yeah, they've shut it down
*  This is so it's they don't know how long it's gonna take for this virus to run its cycle
*  Yeah, and it could conceivably take a year. I don't know man
*  This that's the weirdest thing about all this is like sometimes when I'm in bed at night
*  Like I'll get up to take a leak or something like that. I'll go. This is crazy. Like no one knows what's happening
*  No one knows what's going to happen and then we're relying on
*  Politicians to make these decisions and these choices and based on disease experts who weren't adequately
*  Funded or prepared to take this on in the first place. Apparently the Trump administration and got rid of the pandemic office
*  There was a whole office. It's supposed to be I've seen both
*  Yay, and nay on that one people like fact-checked it is not true and then other people are saying that he did
*  That's a good question because the woman who asked Trump kind of caught him off guard and he wasn't aware of it
*  Yeah
*  There's so many stupid fucking there's this one lady that there's this video of her saying
*  I heard that someone in your office referred to it as the kung flu. I saw that
*  Yeah, like and you're like, is this the time to worry about this?
*  Who's the person he goes who who did it?
*  She they didn't know and then they did the same thing to Kellyanne Conway and they're asking her and she's like
*  Well, do you know my husband's half Asian? My children are Asian. Do you think I'm great? Like what do you I'm not gonna deal in hypotheticals
*  This is a nonsense conversation
*  But it's this goddamn social justice narrative that people are still trying to push even in times of crisis who called it the kung flu
*  Like if Bobby McFuckface called it kung flu and you got a video of hey Bobby, don't do that. That's kind of fucked up
*  Yeah, but you don't even have a name
*  You said you heard someone called it the kung flu and this is what you want to talk to the president about you have one
*  Goddamn question the name of a thing. How are we going to die?
*  Circle and yeah influence versus circle of concern also
*  This is something that they know makes people upset and is something they know that can get a rise
*  Yeah, and something they know that can get traction in terms of a news story
*  Which is the exact opposite of what they should be doing exactly
*  Well, this is what you you know, the one good thing about this is it highlights how much?
*  Nonsense we put credence to how much nonsense we spend time paying attention to and
*  That stuff when you're just trying to get food and toilet paper and stay healthy and not get a fucking killer disease
*  All those other things throw they get thrown out the window and that's the good thing about this
*  That's the one of the only good things the other good thing. I think is I'm hoping this gives us a greater sense of community
*  I mean, I'm hoping that people have together. I really do
*  I really hope people come together and they realize that this is we have had it so easy and it's one of the reasons why we
*  Complaining about stupid shit is because we had it so easy
*  Yeah, and I hope it tightens this social contract that we should have where we're taking care of older generations and everything in between
*  Yeah
*  And I hope they do if they didn't used to have a pandemic department that was shut down
*  Find out that's true since we're here was we are in the middle of talking about this did the Trump administration
*  Closed down the same dynamic multiple posts where it said they did and then multiple where it said they did the problem with today
*  Bullshit out there Andy so much bullshit
*  It's so hard and it's easy for guys like us we have you know hundreds of pounds of meat sitting around our families are fed
*  You know, we don't have to worry about it. Like a lot of people do would you give that meat away to people in need?
*  I'm giving that meat away. I'm giving it to all my way to giving it away to a lot of my friends, but I
*  Try to give something to Duncan, but his wife won't let him come back. Why did you guys get in trouble?
*  Scared
*  Yeah, she's scared. Well, they're they're new parents. They have a one-year-old. She's you know, she's a young gal
*  Yeah, his outfit was amazing. I know yours is not bad either
*  Well, I've worn that one many times. That's my go-to. I'm too stoned. Yeah outfit NASA suit sunglasses. It's a power move though
*  Yeah, you could just sit there. Yeah
*  I'm in space bitch. Yeah, meanwhile, Duncan's got a face mask on a gilly suit sunglasses
*  Fucking gilly suits are so uncomfortable
*  Fuck it kept falling down. Like I was saying that you like a fat white trash lady in Florida
*  That's got a halter top. Oh, yeah, and it's just like you gotta kind of keep pulling that thing up while you're yelling at
*  Your husband the concept is great. They don't work. It's just so heavy you sweat your ass off. It's exhausting
*  Just take all that shit off. Yeah, I would feel like just sit cuz subalpine
*  Camo would be just as effective if you're hiding when I went through sniper school
*  They gave you a gilly suit and before this it was the shooting phase first and then the snark stalking phase
*  And you're like taking off burlap and these intricate patterns and we did stocking out in Nylund
*  Which is the deserts of high desert of California by the chocolate mountains and there's just a couple like it's sparse
*  Some trees some brushes you're wearing a gilly suit. Fuck me and you're like crawling and the Sun is hitting you and it's like
*  It's glowing. It's just like ha
*  And then so you spent like
*  Months getting these things ready and then you just got scissors out just cutting all of this crap off to trend use weight
*  Well, it is the light reflects to it differently
*  It has so what you're better off doing is just grabbing local like foliage in the area and just jamming it in there
*  Okay, and you can move it's just they're miserable. It was a horrendous experience
*  the idea of camo with animals is so interesting to me, you know, because
*  When I first found the animals don't see things the way we see things they see movement, yeah
*  But makes sense, you know, like they have to that's that's what keeps them alive something twitches
*  Like what the fuck was that? Was that something real?
*  You've seen elk kind of look in your direction not even sure what you are. Yeah, and like what are you?
*  Yeah, like bitch you don't even know. Yeah, it's like this weird
*  Movement thing where they're like just waiting to see movement if you don't move long enough
*  You could stay still long enough. They just go about their business. Yeah, but then they come check back again
*  That's when they bust me
*  Sometimes from time to time now that you're living in Montana, how often are you getting to go hunt?
*  You know, I actually didn't use my Montana tag last year. I thought I didn't I had
*  Success in Alberta. I got a bull there and a mule deer and then I had success on that last day in Utah
*  And I didn't I didn't have the room for any more meat
*  I ate my Montana deer and elk tag. Oh wow. Yeah. Well good for you. Yeah
*  Opportunity is there for sure though. I almost feel like for me
*  I would have maybe gone and donated the meat because it's like one of the things about and people say why would you do that?
*  One of the things about hunting is I think you have to do it a lot
*  it's like
*  stand up or jujitsu or a lot there's a lot of things where the
*  Experience is so intense and so alien from everyday life that you have to be accustomed to like one of the things about
*  Fighting that I always found like I fought way better when I fought often because of like like one of my biggest
*  Tournaments that I won was the American Open that I won right at I fought one week and then I fought the next week and
*  I'm like I feel so normal. It's feel so normal to fight. I just did it. There's a currency aspect
*  Yeah, yeah, it's the same thing in all this stuff like the
*  Skydiving and based on the stuff I used to do the more you do it. It's your own autopilot
*  Yeah, you get used to that experience
*  Yeah
*  The farther from the exposure used like it doesn't feel quite right or then you start like is this how I do this
*  Like is this how you route that my first hunt every year is always weird
*  That's one of the reasons why I really like going to lanai first because first of all there's like an actual
*  Ethical imperative to kill animals on one. Yeah, they have to they need you to be a savage murderer
*  Yeah, they fucking have 30,000 deer in a tiny tiny island with 3,000 people
*  Yeah, so they need you to do but and it also it's really hard to do like bow hunting on one
*  I one of the things that Dudley and I found out and cam on our last hunt last year
*  The we go how many people are bow hunting this year? It's like a lot like well
*  How many people are successful he goes we had a hundred and fifty hunts a hundred fifty hunters last year one was successful
*  Everybody else pulled out the rifle like what whoa one guy
*  Was successful bow hunting in the time that we were there to the time that we were there again in a whole year
*  Shit man, they're so wired me. I don't have to tell you. Yeah, I was there
*  It was humbling but you do get a bunch of reps out
*  Like if you had a little rust you need to doubt yeah knock off
*  That is where it's gonna you'll be yes
*  If you get in this zone there and you can start getting in on them
*  You are gonna be a ninja on some Western Rocky Mountain stuff the one
*  Axis deer that I shot last year Dudley and I crawled for a good solid hour and a half till we got to position
*  I mean we fucking creepy creepy crawled until we got behind this bush
*  Yeah, and then I shot this deer like 50 plus yards
*  From my knees and and whacked him and it was like that was a hard-earned
*  Oh, yeah, harder and kill and that's a far shot on one of those things
*  Yes, cuz those fuckers are so fast
*  We have a video of me shooting one at 80 and the deer is just sitting there eating
*  Feeding yeah the arrow because I have a lighted knock arrows tracking in in flight headed to the pump station
*  15 yards away. He's like he hears it
*  So yeah within this arrows going 290 feet a second
*  15 yards away from him he hears it and he's gone and then by the time the arrow got to him his physical body was
*  No longer there. It's like here. He is it's going right there and then the arrows on he's like
*  Bye when I was there with Barclay he had a cameraman behind him
*  and I think his shot was inside of 40 and the guy was taking high-speed pictures just
*  and
*  You see the arrow release and animal is calm and in the next frame
*  The striations that are visible in the every to includes like its nose
*  Every muscle in the animal and the arrow is just like a little bit out of the bow and then by the time where the arrow
*  Hits the thing is like halfway off the frame
*  I'm like yeah, we found is you got to hunt him in the afternoon because it's windy and they don't hear anything
*  We had four days out there where it was
*  like just enough wind that it would swirl and
*  Barkle and I just trudged through and just
*  Discussed the more the most optimum ways to like commit suicide in the evenings cam shot one bedded at 70 yards
*  He hit a frontal shot at 70 yards right in the pump station
*  Because these campaigns yes savage
*  But it's like the perfect shot at 70 yards and like that's how you do it like they don't hear it because it's so far away
*  Yeah, I think was bedded and it was windy
*  Now the first one I actually shot there was bedded too. Yeah, that's the way to do it
*  If you can catch them bedded at least you have this like
*  Window where they have to get to their feet before they can run
*  It's not a big window. That's not a big window. Well that you're talking about an animal that evolved to get away from tigers
*  Yeah, no
*  They I've never been around an animal that was more tuned up or keyed up than that and also the pressure they get hunted
*  365 days a year and then there's snipers that come there every day just to reduce the population because they have to right they have to
*  You know, but also the feed the locals they eat great
*  Yeah, I mean they're eating the best meat on earth hard to describe to people how good access to you is so delicious
*  It's so delicious elk over it. Yeah, just by a touch. Well, it's a little more tender than elk
*  Which is interesting because they're so fast you think like I had some elk last night
*  It was delicious, but like there's a chew to it
*  You know elk is like I like it but my kids like that. I'm so chewy. How was that elk heart you it?
*  Fantastic elk heart tacos so good hard pass on that
*  You don't eat the heart
*  No, I eat the not exploratory with my food. I'll eat tacos, but I need it to be like out of the sirloin
*  Well when I went carnivore one of the things I started eating is I started eating a lot of liver organ meats
*  Yeah, I buy a lot of beef liver. I buy that all the time whenever stores have it. I buy beef liver
*  Oh, it's really good for you. I'm gonna take a hard pass on that too. Mmm. It's good. Can you leave it off for me?
*  That's fine. You can have all of that eggs. I've been eating a lot of eggs
*  Did I the best I ever felt was when I went carnivore for a month strict carnivore for a month
*  I didn't do anything but carnivore like occasionally. I'll have like a grape or something like that
*  And maybe I ate all of why'd you come off of it? Oh
*  Because I just committed to it for January. Yeah, and I'm not really off of it
*  I just I'm mostly eating that way and then occasionally I'll fuck off and have a piece of apple pie like during this
*  Apocalypse I've been kind of eating whatever
*  Because I'm figured like while this apocalypse is going on
*  I'm just gonna take in calories because I don't want to be a prissy
*  Diet person when you know all I can have is rice variable discipline
*  I'm in the same way I can eat an entire trash bag full of popcorn and I will sometimes
*  But it's just the concern is it could get to the pool
*  Like I don't want to have my body adjust to eating regular food when that might be the only thing available
*  I'm really concerned that that could we could come down to a supply chain problem and a food problem
*  And you know if that does happen look at this is one thing
*  This is one thing of a virus
*  What if one thing gets compounded by solar flares that knock out the power grid or an earthquake or multiple things that could happen?
*  Simultaneously at any time we're gonna find out who people really are really fast. Yes. Yes
*  All right, Andy, we just did three hours we did. Yeah
*  That's how you do that. I guess how crazy is that three hours in ten minutes. It's over. It's 310 now
*  And we did it for is it 310 or we did 310. All right, it's 320. It's according to that thing
*  Don't which one's right. Is this one 310? Oh that one says 310. Oh 320 is the date you fucking retard
