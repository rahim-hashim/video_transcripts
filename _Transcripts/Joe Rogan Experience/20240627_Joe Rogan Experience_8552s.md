# Joe Rogan Experience #1988 - James Reed
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA)
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=0.0s)]
*  What's going on, man? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=13.16s)]
*  What an incredible piece of work you put together. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=15.0s)]
*  I'm so impressed and I loved it so much. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=19.76s)]
*  I mean, I don't even know where to begin. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=22.88s)]
*  Well, I'm very pleased you liked it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=26.52s)]
*  You tell me, where do you want to begin? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  Where did it, how did it start? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=31.84s)]
*  Like, how long did it take, first of all, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=33.72s)]
*  to get embedded to the point where they allowed you [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=35.84s)]
*  to be around them like that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=39.32s)]
*  OK, so I mean... [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=41.84s)]
*  We should tell her, but it's Chimp Empire. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=43.88s)]
*  It's Chimp Empire, yeah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=45.96s)]
*  So four-part series chronicling this unusual period [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  in the N'Gogo chimpanzees' lives, right? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=53.08s)]
*  So we're very, very lucky. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=55.72s)]
*  Basically, there's a scientific project out there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=60.44s)]
*  that's been working at N'Gogo for almost 30 years now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=64.0s)]
*  So scientists, when they first arrived, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=68.4s)]
*  the chimpanzees were not habituated to humans at all. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=70.8s)]
*  So they kind of came knowing there was a big group of chimps [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=75.16s)]
*  out there, but they didn't know anything about how many there were [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=78.03999999999999s)]
*  or who they were. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=82.12s)]
*  And they had to go through this process of habituation, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=83.67999999999999s)]
*  which basically means sort of following them around [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=87.8s)]
*  and getting them used to humans observing them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=90.88s)]
*  So in those early days, the chimps would just run off. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=94.0s)]
*  They'd have total fear for humans. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=97.32s)]
*  So they weren't even able to see them, let alone study them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=99.28s)]
*  But that's what... [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  They gradually overcame that fear, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=103.72s)]
*  and to the point where the scientists can just arrive [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=106.44s)]
*  with their notebooks and gently follow them around [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=110.52s)]
*  kind of within the group every day. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=112.64s)]
*  So after years of doing that, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  it makes it possible for a film crew to come in [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=118.56s)]
*  and kind of literally walk in their footsteps. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=121.6s)]
*  So that process of actually being accepted into the chimpanzees group [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  was sort of... [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=129.44s)]
*  We had this previous scientific project that enabled us to do that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=130.6s)]
*  And in terms of for the series, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  we had like 400 filming days. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=140.48s)]
*  We knew that we wanted to be sort of observing them in detail [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=144.0s)]
*  and from sort of within the group. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=148.6s)]
*  And yeah, we were able to do that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=151.76s)]
*  We had a great crew, lightweight equipment, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=154.32s)]
*  and sort of followed them around constantly for about 400 days. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=160.44s)]
*  I mean, the footage you guys acquired, it's really amazing. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=166.24s)]
*  It's like a chimp was carrying around a camera. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=167.96s)]
*  Was there any moment where they interacted with you guys [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=173.04s)]
*  where you thought maybe you were threatened or in danger? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=177.0s)]
*  You know, if you're filming lions or something [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  from a sort of safari vehicle, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=185.72s)]
*  you film them with a long lens [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=188.44s)]
*  and you're kind of spying on them from a distance. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=190.6s)]
*  So they might sort of clock that you're in a car from a long way away, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  but you're observing them and you're kind of not part of it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=197.67999999999998s)]
*  You're looking in from the outside. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=201.0s)]
*  With chimps, partly because of the habitat they live in, right? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=204.0s)]
*  It's a dense rainforest. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  So if you were 50 metres away, you can't see anything. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=211.2s)]
*  So you need to be close to the chimps to observe and film them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=214.48s)]
*  And also, it wouldn't be a good idea to try and creep around [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=219.16s)]
*  and hide from them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=222.08s)]
*  They wouldn't like that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=223.72s)]
*  So you sort of you peacefully, gently kind of make your presence known. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  And they sort of they acknowledge you when you turn up. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=231.12s)]
*  They certainly sort of checking you out. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=234.04000000000002s)]
*  But then they go about their daily business. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=236.8s)]
*  And it's incredible how little interaction they have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=239.24s)]
*  and how little that they sort of ever, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  ever even come close to interacting with you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=249.32s)]
*  Wow. But what about if you have food or something that they want? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=252.28s)]
*  Do they get curious about things like that? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=255.84s)]
*  You know, they're very careful there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=257.84s)]
*  And the scientists for years have sort of made sure that, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=260.24s)]
*  you know, the strict rules that you can't take, you take food in, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=264.4s)]
*  but it's in concealed containers. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=268.4s)]
*  You don't eat in front of the chimps. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=270.15999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly the sort of thing that could cause a situation. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=272.44s)]
*  If there was some association with food or something that you had that they wanted. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=276.88s)]
*  So that's really carefully managed. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=282.08s)]
*  And there's it, you know, they don't associate you with food [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=284.64s)]
*  and they just treat you as a sort of passive observer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=288.64s)]
*  Having said that, you know, you are you're right in there. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, they could be just sitting around peacefully [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=295.96s)]
*  sort of playing or grooming each other, or they could be doing [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=299.47999999999996s)]
*  something quite aggressive and they could be fighting or they could be [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=303.44s)]
*  patrolling for another group or hunting. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=306.84s)]
*  And then even though none of it is sort of targeted at you, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=309.64s)]
*  they are behaving in in a way that can be quite intimidating around you. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=314.96s)]
*  Was what was I mean, I think the most disturbing thing to me with chimps is, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=320.88s)]
*  well, there's two things, one, that they murder each other, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=327.32s)]
*  but to the hunting of the monkeys, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=329.76s)]
*  watching them hunt and kill and eat monkeys is so weird for. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=333.04s)]
*  I mean, I think was David Attenborough the first one to capture that on film? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=338.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know whether he was the first one. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=344.36s)]
*  I think Jane Goodall back in the day when she was doing the gun, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=346.44s)]
*  well, she still has the gun by chimp site. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=351.24s)]
*  But I think she and maybe a Nat Geo team, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=353.52s)]
*  I think they sort of documented it for the first time. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=358.16s)]
*  And at that point, nobody knew this this happened. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=362.52s)]
*  And then I think on the David Attenborough project, it was documented as well. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=365.68s)]
*  But in and go go, you know, they're the biggest group ever known, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=370.04s)]
*  and they are very strong and powerful group. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=374.92s)]
*  And there's a lot of males and it is often the males that are involved in the hunting. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=379.24s)]
*  And they have taken hunting monkeys to to another level. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=384.16s)]
*  Was that what is that like to witness live because primates eating primates? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=389.0s)]
*  I don't know why, but it's just it doesn't feel right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=395.6s)]
*  Visceral reactions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=399.72s)]
*  I think, yeah, it feels, you know, because you kind of group, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=402.12s)]
*  you group primates together and we're sort of separate in a way. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=405.88s)]
*  Oh, that's how you think of them anyway. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=410.44s)]
*  And I think also you spend some, you know, if you're interested in chimps, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=413.44s)]
*  or you spend time around them, you can't you're constantly making connections [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=417.0s)]
*  between you and them. So you're feeling even though it's kind of a one way thing, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=421.68s)]
*  you're feeling those similarities all the time. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=426.84s)]
*  And then you but then you see how they behave to other primates. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=430.4s)]
*  And and it's quite it's shocking. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=435.8s)]
*  You can't believe that as sophisticated as they are and how connected you feel to them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=438.56s)]
*  You know, they they they don't feel that sort of level of compassion [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=445.92s)]
*  or empathy for other primates at all. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=450.12s)]
*  And they are. Yeah, they they hunt them regularly. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=452.48s)]
*  Yeah. How many did you witness them kill? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=455.64000000000004s)]
*  It was it was quite a lot. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=459.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, we've it's a completely sort of true, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=461.52000000000004s)]
*  authentic story that we documented. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=466.36s)]
*  So so everything in there is is what happened in in the order that it happened. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=469.0s)]
*  But obviously, we were there for 400 days. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=475.44s)]
*  So there's quite a lot of things that we filmed that didn't make it in. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=477.24s)]
*  Now, we didn't keep anything back that we thought was relevant to the story. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  But there are sometimes other examples or other hunts for hunts is a really good example. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  You know, we didn't we didn't put in the series every time they hunted a monkey, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=489.48s)]
*  because it would be a lot of hunting monkeys. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=492.8s)]
*  We saw it quite a lot. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=496.36s)]
*  And, you know, I remember on the on the second shoot, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  but it was the first time the a new camera crew had had come out. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=502.76s)]
*  I was with one of the camera women, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=508.24s)]
*  Lauren, and she she was really experienced [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=511.88s)]
*  woman in filming in hostile and remote locations, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=515.56s)]
*  but I never filmed chimps before and wasn't really used to the environment. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=518.4s)]
*  And on our first day out, they they hunted a big black and white [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  colobus monkey. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=528.12s)]
*  And, you know, I mean, it's everything that goes along with it. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=529.8s)]
*  It's the sort of the cooperation, the teamwork. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=534.04s)]
*  You know, there's a tension in in the air when you know that they're going to hunt. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=539.44s)]
*  They've decided to hunt, but it's not on yet. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=544.0s)]
*  And they're sort of moving around the forest, trying to get in a position [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=547.24s)]
*  where they can successfully catch this monkey. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=551.48s)]
*  But then once they go for it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=554.56s)]
*  and then they're just chasing it and it and it's chaos. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=556.36s)]
*  And, you know, they they are organized in a way. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=560.52s)]
*  They know exactly what they're doing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=564.04s)]
*  But you're sort of running around after it and you quite often don't know [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=566.0s)]
*  don't know exactly what's happening. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=569.44s)]
*  Where's the monkey? Where are the chimps? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  And she she was just like, where am I? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=572.52s)]
*  Like, what have I got myself into? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=576.44s)]
*  But she was absolutely amazing because she sort of, you know, held the shots [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=579.52s)]
*  and a lot of what she filmed that day is in the series, actually. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=582.64s)]
*  But I don't know the energy when you're there [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=585.84s)]
*  and you're watching it, the the energy of the whole thing takes over. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=589.36s)]
*  And, you know, maybe this isn't a good thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=594.2s)]
*  But I think when you have seen it quite a few times and you accept it [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=597.08s)]
*  as part of the the natural relationship between these two species, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=600.2800000000001s)]
*  you do become slightly desensitized to it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=605.0s)]
*  And yeah, I remember the first time I saw it being being very shocked. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=609.0s)]
*  But once you've seen it quite a lot and you know, it's a natural part of their lives, you. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=612.96s)]
*  Yeah, you don't you don't feel the same way about it, actually. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=618.08s)]
*  Is that their preferred food, do you think? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=620.92s)]
*  Well, they they're mainly fruit eaters, ripe fruit specialists. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=623.92s)]
*  So, you know, their territory is is filled with fruit and trees [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=628.4s)]
*  and those trees fruit at different times and at different cycles. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=634.64s)]
*  And they have this incredible knowledge of of all the trees [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=638.6s)]
*  that are in their territory. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=642.48s)]
*  And and they have a good idea about when they're going to come into fruit as well. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=644.48s)]
*  So they're always moving around this vast territory [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=648.2s)]
*  and sort of checking out what's in fruit and what isn't. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=650.84s)]
*  And they'll know that something's that's not quite and it's not quite right. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=653.96s)]
*  It's not. But that'll that'll stay there and they'll come back [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=658.16s)]
*  and they'll they'll feed off that tree in in in the days immediately after. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=661.6s)]
*  So that's really that's that's they have to survive. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=666.48s)]
*  They they they depend on fruit. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=670.0s)]
*  Monkeys seem to provide a sort of a different [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=673.2s)]
*  purpose in in the chimpanzee community. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=678.76s)]
*  They're definitely valuable from a nutritional point of view, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=682.56s)]
*  but there seems to be other things going on as to why they hunt. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=686.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm going to use some of the wrong terms here [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=691.56s)]
*  that scientists probably wouldn't wouldn't support, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=695.8s)]
*  but they do seem to enjoy it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=698.68s)]
*  It does seem to provide some sort of cooperative function. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=701.16s)]
*  You know, it's not it's not sport, but at the same time, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=705.7199999999999s)]
*  you know, it's it's not purely for survival. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=710.12s)]
*  It's the something else there. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=713.04s)]
*  And I think in in, you know, when you watch them share meat [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=715.92s)]
*  after they've they've hunted a monkey, that's when some of its [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=720.0s)]
*  sort of function becomes clear because who who catches the monkey [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=724.24s)]
*  and then who gets a share of that becomes a really political business. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=728.9200000000001s)]
*  And and and that feels, you know, from from our perspective, watching it, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=735.44s)]
*  that suddenly it all sort of fell into place a little bit [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=741.32s)]
*  because who gets meat and who doesn't has a sort of [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=744.2800000000001s)]
*  it's very political. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=749.2s)]
*  Yeah, it seemed like that in the documentary where it would in particularly [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=751.4399999999999s)]
*  when the female with the baby got some and the one male [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=756.88s)]
*  that didn't get very upset and attacked her. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=761.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's that that's a kind of a classic example of it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=763.84s)]
*  Or. Yeah, you know, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=769.36s)]
*  they're all they're trying to get a piece of meat because they want to, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=773.1999999999999s)]
*  but it risks upsetting other chimps. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=778.52s)]
*  Because there's only so much meat. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=784.28s)]
*  There's only so much. Yeah. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=785.88s)]
*  And there's sort of the strongest alliances [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=788.12s)]
*  are being sort of served in in that situation. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=791.8s)]
*  So sometimes, you know, chimps get a scrap here or there. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=794.88s)]
*  In that particular instant, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=798.1999999999999s)]
*  she she made it away with quite a big share of the monkey. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=801.16s)]
*  And I think, you know, I wasn't there filming that particular moment, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=805.4399999999999s)]
*  but I remember the the crew saying when they came back, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=809.0799999999999s)]
*  it did feel like that that's trouble, actually. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=812.52s)]
*  Good, good for you for getting a share. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=815.28s)]
*  But actually, that's you're going to get into trouble somehow. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=816.88s)]
*  But because, you know, whether she was aware [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=820.64s)]
*  that there was somebody who was, you know, a high ranking male [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=823.68s)]
*  was being excluded at the same time. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=827.04s)]
*  So there was this tension between the males. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=829.92s)]
*  And then this was further complicated by a female getting a share. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=833.08s)]
*  And then he just blew his lid. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=837.4s)]
*  It's just so fascinating to watch the the communication [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=839.56s)]
*  and the just the politics that are involved and the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=844.56s)]
*  all the negotiation and the way they treat each other. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=849.2s)]
*  It's what was that surprising to you that that it was so complex? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=852.64s)]
*  Yes, I mean, I've worked with chimps before. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=859.84s)]
*  You know, I'm not a chimps scientist. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=864.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm not an expert in that sense. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=866.48s)]
*  But but I have, you know, I've done I've done a film myself [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=868.48s)]
*  a few years earlier on the Ngogo chimps. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=873.24s)]
*  I also worked on another one years previously. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=875.88s)]
*  So so some of that I knew and that and and in part, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=878.96s)]
*  that was why we made the series that we knew there was going to be [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=883.0400000000001s)]
*  this level of complexity. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=885.96s)]
*  But we'd never and I don't think anyone has ever [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=887.96s)]
*  committed that much sort of filming resource and dedication [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  to that intense of a period. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  So we sort of seem to be able to record it at a level of detail [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=900.48s)]
*  I hadn't seen before, and I don't think anybody else has. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=904.64s)]
*  And that so that did surprise us. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=907.44s)]
*  Yeah. And it surprised me personally. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  It's the sense of awareness. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=913.12s)]
*  The sense of awareness. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=915.12s)]
*  You know, as far as we know, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=917.96s)]
*  that there's quite limited vocal communication with chimps. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=919.72s)]
*  You know, they they make sort of they make food grunts, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=924.5600000000001s)]
*  which tells other chimps that they're enjoying some food. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=928.52s)]
*  They make pant grunts, which are a sort of oh, oh, oh, oh. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=932.72s)]
*  This this noise that they make to each other, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=937.28s)]
*  which is a signal of submission and their various calls. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=939.8s)]
*  But as far as we know, there's there's not a huge amount of complexity in that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=944.44s)]
*  There's not there's not a lot of language. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=949.28s)]
*  But the amazing thing is that there seems to be some other level [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=951.88s)]
*  of communication going on, that they somehow know [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=957.5600000000001s)]
*  and what each other are about to do or in some circumstances, they don't. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=961.9200000000001s)]
*  And they're surprised and it causes conflict. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=967.28s)]
*  But I think about particularly when you watch [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=969.36s)]
*  chimps go on patrol, right? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=972.76s)]
*  They patrol their borders, the borders of their territory. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=975.08s)]
*  And they do that in in silence. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=980.0s)]
*  And they do that for a reason, because they don't want anybody [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=982.32s)]
*  outside their territory to know where they are. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=985.28s)]
*  But how to coordinate that when they're not making any [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=988.6s)]
*  noise to each other at all, that they're looking at each other [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=992.64s)]
*  and they're sort of they appear to be reading each other's intentions. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=996.88s)]
*  And they kind of know without anybody saying anything [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1001.3199999999999s)]
*  that we're going on we're going on patrol now. This is it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1004.88s)]
*  That was very fascinating. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1008.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I was trying to figure it out myself. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1010.4s)]
*  Like, how are they coordinating this? Like, how do they know? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1013.68s)]
*  You know, they they have endless [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1017.8399999999999s)]
*  conversations with the scientists and go at and go go about that. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1020.4s)]
*  And, you know, they're stumped as well, because there aren't really any [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1024.48s)]
*  there aren't really any signals that this is about to happen. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1029.84s)]
*  And, you know, they'll be lying around or grooming or doing something [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1034.12s)]
*  completely disconnected. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1038.8799999999999s)]
*  And then one ship will will will get up and just start walking off [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1042.76s)]
*  in the direction of the border. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1048.52s)]
*  And and then the others will join. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1050.72s)]
*  And then as they start moving closer to the border, they're just [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1053.44s)]
*  the amount they vocalize just goes down and down and down [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1057.2s)]
*  to the point of being completely silent. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1060.44s)]
*  And yet it's a mystery that there must be something going on there. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1063.48s)]
*  And and often, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1069.32s)]
*  you know, maybe it's associated with specific individual chimps [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1072.52s)]
*  who the other chimps know that those guys are patrol leaders. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1077.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, years ago, in the early days, when when the scientists [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1082.8s)]
*  were first there, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1086.48s)]
*  there was a chimp called Ellington and and he was the patrol leader [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1088.8400000000001s)]
*  when N'Gogo was one big group. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1095.2s)]
*  He never showed any real interest in the dominance hierarchy. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  So he never made a play to be alpha. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1102.2s)]
*  Didn't really seem that bothered. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1104.88s)]
*  He was a high ranking male, but he was not engaged [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1106.28s)]
*  in that internal dominance struggle at all, really. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1109.4s)]
*  But of all the patrols that they witnessed there, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1113.2s)]
*  Ellington was the one who was present for the most and quite often leading them. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1118.0800000000002s)]
*  So he seemed to have this this attraction to that behavior [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1122.52s)]
*  or this this this ability or or desire [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1127.32s)]
*  to go and patrol their borders more than other chimps. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1131.88s)]
*  And maybe in some ways, that explains the lack of communication, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1136.56s)]
*  that they're more that it's it's actually the very fact of Ellington [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1140.12s)]
*  getting up and moving off for no apparent reason does communicate [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1144.04s)]
*  to the other chimps. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1149.1599999999999s)]
*  OK, we're going to go on patrol now. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1150.52s)]
*  And, you know, the the sort of modern version of Ellington, who was [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1153.04s)]
*  who was around during our filming period, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1158.1599999999999s)]
*  is a chimpanzee called Rollins, who similarly [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  has never shown any real interest to make it to the alpha position. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1166.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, whilst all the other males are sort of jostling for position there [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1171.8s)]
*  and you get you get the feeling that ultimately they all want to be [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1176.4s)]
*  on that top spot and they'll just get as high as they can. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1179.96s)]
*  Rollins doesn't seem to doesn't seem to have that desire [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1183.04s)]
*  or certainly doesn't it doesn't appear so. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1187.4s)]
*  But he is the patrol leader. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1190.76s)]
*  He's he's always out there in front [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1193.72s)]
*  and taking the Western group on on patrols. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1196.68s)]
*  And they do it a lot. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1199.76s)]
*  And it's very often him. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  And and what was interesting was that his his younger brother, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1203.88s)]
*  who really is just an adolescent chimp Damien, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1209.68s)]
*  he was just kind of coming of age or just come of age [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1214.48s)]
*  when we started filming for Chimp Empire. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1217.3200000000002s)]
*  And he really grew into that role during our filming period. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1219.68s)]
*  He became Rollins is sort of second in command during that period. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1224.6000000000001s)]
*  And they were so time and they look very similar anyway. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1229.92s)]
*  They're very different ages, actually. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1233.2s)]
*  They've got the same father, different mother, very different ages. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1234.76s)]
*  But they they they look the same. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1238.3600000000001s)]
*  But but they don't they don't they don't know that they're brothers. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1240.68s)]
*  But for some reason, they have this extremely close connection [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1245.3600000000001s)]
*  and both how appear to have a real desire to to engage in this territorial behavior. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1249.68s)]
*  It's so wild to watch because there are centuries. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1256.72s)]
*  There's ones that are on the lookout. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1260.68s)]
*  They they they hold a particular post and there's no communication. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1262.44s)]
*  It's like, I mean, that doesn't appear to be. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1267.52s)]
*  I mean, this is the thing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1270.3200000000002s)]
*  Like I've often asked about how how is this functioning? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1271.24s)]
*  You know, you don't like say other parts of their lives that they're making. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1275.44s)]
*  Vocalizations and signals that even though you don't understand what they are, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1279.68s)]
*  you can you can start to see patterns like the food grunts, for instance. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1283.68s)]
*  You know, that's a that's a very it's a unique sound. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1288.24s)]
*  And they make it when they're enjoying food and then the rest of chimps [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1291.8s)]
*  gather and they enjoy the same food. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1295.6000000000001s)]
*  So there's there's a clear way to to to observe that and to try and understand what it means. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1297.72s)]
*  But patrols are. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1305.28s)]
*  Yeah, they you know, we know we know a lot about them through the scientists [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1307.76s)]
*  and go going through observing them ourselves. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1313.2s)]
*  But there are there are mysterious elements to it that that nobody understands. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1315.64s)]
*  Do you think it's taught behavior like the the main ones had to learn this out of necessity [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  and then everybody else sort of observe this behavior and recognize the importance of it? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1328.96s)]
*  I think that's a it's a good point because we were we were thinking about that a bit [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1334.36s)]
*  when we were there. So Birgel, this this young chimp [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1340.84s)]
*  who was just sort of coming of age, he started attending patrols. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1345.84s)]
*  So he's young, he's only 10 years old, but he's an orphan. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1350.24s)]
*  So it always hung out with all the males anyway. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1354.08s)]
*  And during our filming period, he just really started [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1357.2s)]
*  becoming a more frequent attendee of these these patrols. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1360.4s)]
*  Now, they're they're dangerous and and most younger chimps won't won't do that. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1364.68s)]
*  But yeah, you wonder whether that that's where it kind of starts, that you sort of you just [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1370.48s)]
*  you're mimicking the the chimpanzees that you want to you want to be friends with [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1376.2s)]
*  and you want to be like, and you know that like this is just something you see them do. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1381.92s)]
*  So you do it with them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1387.4s)]
*  And and if you do it regularly enough, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1389.52s)]
*  exactly that they may be just, you know, you don't need to communicate that much. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1393.16s)]
*  You know, you will know each other extremely well. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1398.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, by the way, you're walking in the direction you're heading and who's there, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1401.2s)]
*  what it is you're doing. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1406.28s)]
*  And yes, and maybe there's just a lot of that. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1407.88s)]
*  Did you wonder if somehow or another there's some sort of telepathy [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1411.96s)]
*  and some I mean, some sort of communication that we don't understand, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1416.52s)]
*  where it's pheromones or something? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1420.0800000000002s)]
*  Personally, I wondered all sorts of those things. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1424.4s)]
*  You know, what what is it? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1428.32s)]
*  There there is is there some other signal, you know, I mean, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1430.0800000000002s)]
*  until there's proof for that, it's just pure speculation. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1435.56s)]
*  But there's but there's a gap in the understanding there [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1439.68s)]
*  from a scientific point of view. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1443.2800000000002s)]
*  And, you know, like say if if they were here today, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1445.8000000000002s)]
*  the scientists from Mungogo, they would be saying the same thing that we don't [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1449.3600000000001s)]
*  we don't know exactly how those patrols are instigated [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1453.0400000000002s)]
*  and how the chimps involved know that they're on patrol. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  We do not know that. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1461.44s)]
*  So, you know, that that it leaves your imagination to run wild a little bit. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1462.92s)]
*  Certainly the way that I mean, I think telepathy is maybe [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1468.88s)]
*  a bit strong, but I mean, who knows? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1473.48s)]
*  We don't know that it's not happening. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1476.2s)]
*  I imagine the personal point of view, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1480.0s)]
*  there seems to be quite a lot of sort of signaling through eye movement. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1484.56s)]
*  And again, this this isn't supported by the the scientific data necessarily, but. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1490.16s)]
*  There's you know, they're very sensitive to where each other are looking, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1498.0s)]
*  or at least they appear to be. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1504.12s)]
*  And I remember one chimp, he sadly died, although he leaves a lot of [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1506.28s)]
*  he leaves a lot of offspring at Mungogo. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1513.6s)]
*  But there was a chimp that featured in a film I made a few years ago [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1516.08s)]
*  at Mungogo, and his name was Pinsir. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1520.8s)]
*  And when I first saw shots of Pinsir, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1524.12s)]
*  I felt this like something different about this chimp. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1527.8799999999999s)]
*  And I don't know what it is. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1532.1599999999999s)]
*  And in hindsight, I can't really believe that I couldn't spot it. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1533.28s)]
*  But there was something just seemed very human about him. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1536.08s)]
*  That's sort of looking more closely. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1540.8799999999999s)]
*  And I realized Pinsir had sort of completely white sclera. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1543.76s)]
*  Like like you and I, right. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1548.8s)]
*  So, you know, when I look over like that, you know, exactly [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1550.48s)]
*  you know exactly where I'm looking at. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1553.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a very it's an important part of human cooperation. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1555.08s)]
*  We follow each other's gaze and therefore, you know, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1559.3999999999999s)]
*  what it is I'm interested in or maybe what I'm about to do. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1562.8799999999999s)]
*  But in Chimps, I was I was reading about around it [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1566.6799999999998s)]
*  after I saw this chimp Pinsir with his with his white sclera, whites of the eyes. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  And officially, chimps don't have this characteristic. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1575.8s)]
*  They're they're they're they're supposed to all have like brown [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1579.56s)]
*  where we have whites of the eyes, they have brown. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1585.28s)]
*  So the difference in color between the iris and here is is is less similar. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1587.32s)]
*  There we are. Yeah. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1593.56s)]
*  OK. I mean, that's I mean, it's a good one. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1596.0s)]
*  That that's not even the best sort of picture of Pinsir. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1598.8799999999999s)]
*  And obviously, you can see a bit of discoloration, like, you know, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1602.48s)]
*  they look like quite unhealthy whites of the eyes there. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1605.3999999999999s)]
*  But he has a very defined difference between his iris and whites of the eyes. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1607.76s)]
*  So with Pinsir, even at a distance, you can see where he's looking. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  That may not seem like much, but in a species where we don't fully understand [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1619.48s)]
*  their communication or they appear to be doing things without any vocalizations. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1626.08s)]
*  I wondered, like, you know, how come Pinsir's got this [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1632.1999999999998s)]
*  and what impact does it have? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1635.32s)]
*  I talked to, you know, there are other examples, actually, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1638.4399999999998s)]
*  and there is there was a chimper in Gombe, I think he was called Mr. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1641.24s)]
*  Wurzel, who had very good example of whites of the eyes as well. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1645.16s)]
*  But we started looking into it at N'Gogo [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1651.52s)]
*  and I started talking to the scientists about it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1654.88s)]
*  And and they were like, well, yeah, Pinsir does have whites of the eyes. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1658.36s)]
*  We've you know, we've never really thought about it that much. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1662.48s)]
*  And it's not they didn't notice, but as as filmmakers with our lenses and things, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1665.6s)]
*  we're actually getting we're often looking at the chimps in [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1670.44s)]
*  in a level of detail that the scientists don't see every day. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1674.3200000000002s)]
*  So in a way, we're sort of providing them with some sort of visual data [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1678.4s)]
*  that that was of interest. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1683.92s)]
*  And actually, they they did a proper study on it at N'Gogo and tried to find [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1686.56s)]
*  how many chimps and go go had this sort of whites of the eyes. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1693.72s)]
*  And they found that I can't remember the exact numbers, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1697.9199999999998s)]
*  but it was quite a reasonable percentage of it. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1701.08s)]
*  You know, Pinsir is a great example, but had some version of that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1704.04s)]
*  They don't know why this is. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1708.52s)]
*  But in my sort of excited sort of way, I was thinking, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1711.4399999999998s)]
*  well, here's the biggest group of chimps ever known. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1715.8s)]
*  They cooperate on levels that you don't see regularly in other chimpanzee groups. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1718.6s)]
*  You know, they're on these territorial boundary patrols all the time. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1724.24s)]
*  They hunt all the time. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1728.16s)]
*  They they're very successful on a on a cooperative level. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1729.92s)]
*  And they appear to be doing these things in silence. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1734.72s)]
*  What role do these whites of the eyes play? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1737.84s)]
*  And, you know, anecdotally, the the scientists kind of agreed [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1740.76s)]
*  that there was, you know, there's a possibility that it that it does play some role. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1746.0s)]
*  Like I say, you know, they they're scientists, you know, so it's it's different. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1751.32s)]
*  They need the data to support that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1756.52s)]
*  But there was, you know, what's interesting about Pinsir is that even though he never [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1758.9599999999998s)]
*  he never made it to the top either, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1765.2399999999998s)]
*  but he fathered a huge number of offspring and and he was always there [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1767.36s)]
*  on these cooperative behaviors. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1773.2399999999998s)]
*  So if there's a hunt going on, Pinsir's around. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1775.32s)]
*  So this was like, say, this is just it was just my hypothesis [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1778.72s)]
*  from a non-scientific point of view. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1783.4s)]
*  But I thought he played a sort of disproportionate role [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1785.32s)]
*  in sort of cooperative behaviors. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1790.92s)]
*  But again, it's just it's an area they they know an absolute [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1794.04s)]
*  turn about the chimps and go go is incredible from behavior, genetics, everything. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1797.76s)]
*  They've studied that group of chimps very thoroughly. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1804.0800000000002s)]
*  But there is still a lot they don't know. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1807.24s)]
*  So this whites of the eyes characteristic, this is a very unusual characteristic. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1809.2s)]
*  It's very unusual genetic variation. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1816.44s)]
*  It is. I mean, does do his offspring have this? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1819.64s)]
*  That that's exactly what the scientists wanted to know, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1824.0s)]
*  because obviously for it to be of like evolutionary benefit, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1827.84s)]
*  it needs to it needs to persist. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1832.88s)]
*  And his offspring don't actually not not in a way that, you know, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1835.6399999999999s)]
*  if every kid that Pinsir had sort of came out with these eyes, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1841.1999999999998s)]
*  you would certainly think, well, well, he is he is a little mutation [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1844.52s)]
*  that is that he's been reproductively successful. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1848.24s)]
*  And and this could help and it could actually change. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1852.84s)]
*  But no, they they didn't find that, actually. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1858.28s)]
*  So, you know, for instance, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1860.96s)]
*  Rollins, who's the patrol leader in the West, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1862.64s)]
*  that's Pinsir's son, and he doesn't have that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1868.4s)]
*  He's got incredible eyes, actually. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1872.24s)]
*  They're very piercing, but he doesn't have the same eyes. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1873.88s)]
*  How common is that variation? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1876.88s)]
*  I really think we just say we because the the scientists [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1880.16s)]
*  generously gave made me an author on the paper. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1885.16s)]
*  And I think, you know, I didn't do any of the real science work on it at all. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1888.2s)]
*  But I think because of the conversations we were having, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1892.1200000000001s)]
*  it sort of inspired that that particular study. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1894.92s)]
*  I think they found that there was, again, don't quote me on the numbers, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1900.6000000000001s)]
*  but something in the order of sort of 13 individuals at N'Gogo. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1905.2s)]
*  So a non trivial percentage. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1911.76s)]
*  That sounds very sciencey, but it means that, like, you know, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1916.2s)]
*  it was a significant percentage enough to to take note of. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1918.92s)]
*  And and that that's as far as the studies got. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1924.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't really understand the impact of that. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1928.28s)]
*  If it has any impact at all, you know, it could just be random variation. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1931.28s)]
*  And because N'Gogo is such a huge group, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1936.5600000000002s)]
*  and you know, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1940.24s)]
*  that you would expect to see more variety [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1943.52s)]
*  and more incidences of of things that occur on low levels. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1948.44s)]
*  So they still really don't understand the role of that. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1954.2s)]
*  But it was interesting to me on two levels. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1958.36s)]
*  I thought it was fascinating because it made me just wonder [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1961.04s)]
*  about what's going on behind those eyes. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1964.08s)]
*  But also as a human, you just engage with Pinsir in this, you know, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1966.8400000000001s)]
*  it's like suddenly there's a part of his face that feels a lot more familiar. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1971.16s)]
*  I remember one of the scientists [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1976.64s)]
*  who was there years ago when I was there, Kevin Potts. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1980.6000000000001s)]
*  And like I say, they'd say different things around the fire at night [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1983.64s)]
*  as to what they'd say in the scientific papers. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1988.28s)]
*  I remember Kevin going, oh, I'm totally with you on Pinsir. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1991.3600000000001s)]
*  And he said, honestly, some days I'll be out there following Pinsir around. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=1995.1599999999999s)]
*  And he's just sitting there close to me. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2000.28s)]
*  And I just think, guy, any minute he's going to just turn around and say, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2001.84s)]
*  what are you doing, Kevin? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2006.6s)]
*  I like he was there. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2009.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look at those eyes. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2011.04s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2013.1599999999999s)]
*  He's so unusual. He was remarkable. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2014.84s)]
*  I mean, that that's Kevin Langer Grabber, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2017.8s)]
*  the one of the scientists from N'Gogo that. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2020.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everybody loved Pinsir and everybody was very, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2023.96s)]
*  very engaged with him. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2028.72s)]
*  But even at a distance, you see, you can see what's he thinking? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2030.8s)]
*  What is he about to do? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2034.8s)]
*  And you have to wonder like that. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2038.04s)]
*  It makes us think that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2039.76s)]
*  So are the other chimps reading anything from that? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2041.52s)]
*  Was there any correlation between chimps that have that characteristic [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2046.48s)]
*  and specific roles they play in the tribe? [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2050.48s)]
*  And. Well. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2054.12s)]
*  I mean, as we said, it's, you know, it's a small portion of them [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2057.76s)]
*  and very little sort of they've done no specific study on it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2062.16s)]
*  But Pinsir was the the best example. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2067.8s)]
*  He appeared to be more involved in the cooperative [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2072.88s)]
*  behaviors than your average chimp. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2077.6s)]
*  You know, that's what, you know, the scientists in N'Gogo were saying, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2080.96s)]
*  you know, when there's a hunt, Pinsir's there, you know, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2084.64s)]
*  when there's a patrol, he's there. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2086.56s)]
*  So he seemed. But chimps without white sclera would be doing that as well. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2088.0s)]
*  The interesting thing about Pinsir was how many offspring he had. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2093.68s)]
*  You know, he never he was actually a low ranking male his whole life. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2097.04s)]
*  And he had the same number of offspring as the alpha male at the time. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2100.92s)]
*  So he is an alpha male that sort of dedicated his entire [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2106.44s)]
*  life to knocking off other guys and on his way to the top. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2111.04s)]
*  And all the stress associated with being an alpha male at N'Gogo. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2115.24s)]
*  And actually, you know, it's all ultimately it's all about having kids. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2119.68s)]
*  And he had fewer kids than Pinsir, who had just hung out [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2123.2799999999997s)]
*  at number 18, number 19, you know, shine away from fights, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2127.6s)]
*  but was very successful. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2132.72s)]
*  But those things could be completely unrelated [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2134.92s)]
*  because Pinsir was also fascinating in that, like, he had a different [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2138.32s)]
*  sort of strategy with females as well. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2142.48s)]
*  He was he spent a lot of time with females [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2145.4s)]
*  in ways that some of the higher ranking males didn't. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2149.48s)]
*  So they would, you know, wait until the female they wouldn't really [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2152.36s)]
*  spend much time with the females, concentrate on their male relationships. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2155.96s)]
*  And then when the females, you know, were in a reproductive state [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2159.36s)]
*  and he stressed, then they'd go, all right, OK, now it's time [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2163.72s)]
*  and use their position to gain access to her. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2167.24s)]
*  Whereas Pinsir played the more sort of girlfriend type game. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2170.68s)]
*  He'd spent a lot of time with females, even when they weren't reproductively [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2175.2s)]
*  in that state. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2181.12s)]
*  So it wasn't for immediate benefits, but he spent a lot of time. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2182.08s)]
*  He put the hours in and and yeah, the the the Ugandan [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2186.9599999999996s)]
*  field trackers, they love Pinsir [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2192.8s)]
*  and they used to describe these different female chimps as Pinsir's [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2197.12s)]
*  girlfriends and Pinsir's wives, depending on how much time he spent with them. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2200.52s)]
*  But he spent a lot of time with females. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2204.32s)]
*  So, you know, is there anything to do with the whites of the eyes? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2206.2s)]
*  He was just a fascinating chimp and he did things in a bit of a different way [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2210.2s)]
*  to what your your average male chimp is expected to do. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2214.4s)]
*  It's so interesting that he has that characteristic. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2220.04s)]
*  And then he also exhibits behavior that's slightly more human. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2223.12s)]
*  And clever. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2229.56s)]
*  I know I totally agree. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2230.64s)]
*  You're encouraging me in loads of ways in which the scientists of a low [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2232.88s)]
*  you've got to there's no proof for that, James, there's no proof of that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2236.44s)]
*  But it is. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2239.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with Joe now, so we can go down there. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2240.88s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I that that's I've been [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2243.8s)]
*  you can get really fascinated and carried away with those things. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2247.1600000000003s)]
*  And the thing is, there's loads we just simply don't understand about it. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2251.7200000000003s)]
*  So all of that is possible. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2255.36s)]
*  But yeah, in scientific world, you need that proof, that data to support it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2257.96s)]
*  But like I said, privately, everybody adored Pinsir [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2263.5600000000004s)]
*  and was fascinated by him and knew something different. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2267.44s)]
*  Well, I appreciate the intellectual discipline [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2270.96s)]
*  and separating it that way and saying there is no real scientific evidence. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2273.4399999999996s)]
*  But my goodness is it's it's so fascinating. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2277.2s)]
*  The whole thing was incredible. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, I feel like I learned more watching those chimps [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2282.3999999999996s)]
*  from your documentary than anything. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2285.48s)]
*  And I've been obsessed with chimps, like you see with a skull and everything. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2287.4399999999996s)]
*  My whole life, I've I think they're so interesting. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2290.8799999999997s)]
*  They're so close to us. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2295.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, and, you know, at one point in time, we were sort of in the same group [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2296.8399999999997s)]
*  of hominids and something happened to us and they remain the same. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2301.4s)]
*  And it's just that I think out of all the animals [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2305.04s)]
*  that human beings have ever studied, none of them are as fascinating as chimpanzees. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2309.12s)]
*  There's because of our direct connection to them, our close relation to them. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  I I totally agree. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2319.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, some people love animals [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2320.6800000000003s)]
*  because they're different in different ways. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2323.7200000000003s)]
*  And some people don't like chimps because they're very similar [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2325.84s)]
*  in some ways that are really good and in some ways which are quite dark. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2329.8s)]
*  You know, there are lots of similarities. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2334.12s)]
*  You know, there are important differences as well. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2337.32s)]
*  And I think, you know, that is what makes them so fascinating. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2339.76s)]
*  If they were if they were really, really similar, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2343.6s)]
*  then, you know, it would be too similar. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2347.76s)]
*  And it's sort of the intrigue is sort of where that where is [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2350.76s)]
*  where does that similarity end and the differences begin? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2355.04s)]
*  And I think that's a very sort of personal experience watching chimps. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2358.48s)]
*  I think that's why people find it so cool as well as you. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2363.8s)]
*  You relate to different qualities in them as a species or different individuals. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2366.96s)]
*  And I hope that's kind of what we hope. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2372.08s)]
*  That's what we did for Chimp Empire, because we tried to pick [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2375.12s)]
*  a real range of perspectives and [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2379.68s)]
*  because they are complex creatures, they are all different. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2383.8s)]
*  And, you know, you can say chimpanzees are like this or chimpanzees are like that [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2388.04s)]
*  or a chimpanzee of this age does this or that. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2393.0s)]
*  And and some of those generalisms are true and and and are useful. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2395.44s)]
*  But that sort of individual variation, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  that difference in personality from chimp to chimp that really affects [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  what happens to them and and what they do and and who they have relationships with. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2411.2s)]
*  That's that's what's really fascinating. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2417.48s)]
*  And I think as a human, just, yeah, you gravitate towards [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2419.4s)]
*  different qualities and different characters. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2424.12s)]
*  No, I think you did a fantastic job of highlighting that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2427.2s)]
*  And it's it's so it's so compelling and so interesting. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  And so, I mean, what is it like to be embedded [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2435.16s)]
*  with this tribe for so long and then go back to regular civilization? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2438.96s)]
*  Is there like a bit of an adjustment period? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2445.52s)]
*  Well, like we were there as a team. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2448.28s)]
*  We were there for about 400 days. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2451.04s)]
*  So that's a huge totally immersed. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2453.76s)]
*  The team members or human team members swapped in and out. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2459.32s)]
*  So the the camera crew, which was made up of four people, usually two on each group. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2464.72s)]
*  And they do sort of between six weeks and two months at a time. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2471.96s)]
*  And then they come out and come and leave the forest, leave Uganda, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2477.6s)]
*  come back home, get their lives in order, you know, have some rest. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2480.84s)]
*  And then they come out for another two months when the second team was finished [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2484.04s)]
*  and we sort of tag teamed the camera crews. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2487.56s)]
*  I, you know, I was not out nearly as often as as the camera crew. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2490.72s)]
*  So I personally would go out at the start of the shoots [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2495.6s)]
*  and and help set up with the with the camera teams [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2499.48s)]
*  and and introduce them to what we were trying to do. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2503.6s)]
*  And and the characters we were following and and how we wanted to film them. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2507.08s)]
*  At the same time, there's you know, it's a real sort of observational documentary. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2512.24s)]
*  So my role in it was to, you know, to try and, [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2518.72s)]
*  you know, give them a good sense of the overall approach that we were taking, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2523.7999999999997s)]
*  the dedication that we wanted to film specific characters day after day after day. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2528.92s)]
*  And that, you know, only after filming them in that sort of level of commitment, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2535.08s)]
*  are we going to really get a sense of of who they are. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2541.36s)]
*  And that involves filming chimps, you know, when they're not doing stuff, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2544.2s)]
*  that's very interesting. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2548.44s)]
*  And I remember early days, Gus, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2549.7599999999998s)]
*  he's one of my favorite chimps, the antisocial adolescent. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2553.56s)]
*  He I just thought he was going to be an interesting character from the start. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2559.24s)]
*  But the the camera team, who were sort of tasked with sort of following him, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2563.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, for miles and hours and hours during the day, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2567.96s)]
*  they were coming back at the start and going, you know, I don't know about this guy. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2570.8399999999997s)]
*  He doesn't do a lot. And he's off on his own. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2573.64s)]
*  And, you know, and they'd be hearing all this like commotion [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2575.6s)]
*  over this other part of the forest. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2579.92s)]
*  And as a camera person, it's like, I'm filming the guy doesn't do anything. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2581.56s)]
*  Where's Jackson? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2586.8799999999997s)]
*  I can hear Jackson kicking off and, you know, the jealous of the the people [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2587.7999999999997s)]
*  who had the more sort of immediately exciting targets. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2591.68s)]
*  But that was what we had to do to bring that diversity of characters to life, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2595.56s)]
*  is that, you know, some characters won't won't do a lot on a day to day basis. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2600.8799999999997s)]
*  But then when they do, you're fully invested in them and and you're with them. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2605.96s)]
*  And it was his inactivity that was kind of his story, actually. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2611.24s)]
*  He was often on his own, which meant he wasn't doing a lot [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2615.52s)]
*  because he's just him in the trees. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2618.2s)]
*  But then when he came out of that sort of isolation and tried to groom [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2621.72s)]
*  someone desperately trying to make a friend, he were with him. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2626.08s)]
*  You know, you're like, oh, this guy's coming to the group. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2629.64s)]
*  Maybe he's going to maybe someone's going to groom him back. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2632.64s)]
*  So it was. Yeah, it was important to follow that that range of characters. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2635.0s)]
*  But it would be being sort of immersed for that long. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2640.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, it's an incredible experience. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2645.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think the for everybody involved in it, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2647.12s)]
*  that was part of it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2650.68s)]
*  You're you're living you literally live within the Ngogo Chimpanzee territory [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2651.9199999999996s)]
*  because the the scientific study has a camp. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2657.2s)]
*  So like this small like island in the middle of the Ngogo territory. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2661.2s)]
*  So they're you know, it's it's completely pristine rainforest in every direction. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2667.08s)]
*  But there's a little clearing and it's been there for decades. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2672.16s)]
*  And there's a selection of sort of tents and little log cabins, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2676.16s)]
*  very low impact and small. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2680.52s)]
*  But that's where the scientists and the Ugandan field trackers [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2682.8s)]
*  stay every year when when they go out there. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2685.88s)]
*  And we stayed there. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2688.7599999999998s)]
*  But being immersed in it, even at nighttime, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2690.72s)]
*  you know, where you can hear the sounds of the forest and you know, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2694.24s)]
*  the chimps are out there sleeping not that far from you. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2697.6s)]
*  That really helps with engaging in their lives, actually. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2701.16s)]
*  Had we been able to sort of like nip in and out and stay in a hotel outside, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2705.12s)]
*  you know, everybody wanted, you know, you you miss the comforts a lot, you know. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2709.68s)]
*  When you do get out, you love it. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2714.56s)]
*  But it was an important part of the process to be properly immersed [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2717.24s)]
*  and to live in the forest. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2722.0s)]
*  And it it just it helped you sort of feel what they feel a little bit. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2723.24s)]
*  I would imagine that the coordination of filming [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2728.08s)]
*  and then the editing process of trying to piece together a narrative [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  is incredibly complex and difficult because you have 400 days [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2737.6400000000003s)]
*  of footage that you want to boil down to four shows. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2743.8s)]
*  It is very difficult. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2748.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think, you know, we couldn't know. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2750.0s)]
*  We had ambitions for it, the but we couldn't know how successful [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2753.1600000000003s)]
*  we were going to be at it. You know, I mean, I'm. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2759.52s)]
*  But we managed to film a lot more than I ever expected. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2762.2000000000003s)]
*  So the the schedule and the technical workflow, you know, batteries charging, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2768.28s)]
*  how you offload all the footage each day, the dailies, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2774.28s)]
*  all of that stuff was sort of based on an assumption that we wouldn't, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2778.44s)]
*  you know, we wouldn't have the level of access that we actually had. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2782.64s)]
*  And the team was so good. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2786.84s)]
*  And the the cameras that evolved quite a lot since I was filming chimps [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2789.4s)]
*  even a few years previously. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2795.6800000000003s)]
*  So we got an enormous amount of footage. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2797.64s)]
*  You know, it's also just working with a team of scientists [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2802.04s)]
*  who just totally believed in it and and and enabled us [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2804.76s)]
*  to get that level of access, helped us predict what was going to happen, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2809.2400000000002s)]
*  where they were going to go. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2812.88s)]
*  So we were just, you know, we filmed a lot more than I ever expected. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2814.88s)]
*  And yeah, condensing that down [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2819.52s)]
*  and simplifying it into a four part series was was a huge challenge. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2824.96s)]
*  Like I said, from from the beginning, we we were totally disciplined [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2831.08s)]
*  about certain things, you know, however it turned out, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2835.7200000000003s)]
*  we were going to tell the story that unfolded over that 18 months. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2839.4s)]
*  You know, we just there's not the option to to make things up [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2843.7200000000003s)]
*  or create stories that didn't happen. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2849.4799999999996s)]
*  And so so we were, you know, the challenge was going to be, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2853.4399999999996s)]
*  well, well, what don't what would we not use, basically? [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2859.68s)]
*  So we filmed a lot more than we ever needed. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2863.3999999999996s)]
*  And we did that in terms of range of characters as well. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2868.16s)]
*  There were there are whole character storylines that we filmed [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2871.3599999999997s)]
*  that didn't make it in. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2874.7999999999997s)]
*  So that's where we were. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2876.28s)]
*  That's where our editing process and our sort of [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2878.0s)]
*  the creative approach to it was that we're going to able [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2882.32s)]
*  we're going to be able to make these really dramatic [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2886.92s)]
*  and accessible stories by by mission. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2890.84s)]
*  But it's what we don't have in. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2894.28s)]
*  But that process is sort of like a sculpting process. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2896.92s)]
*  You sort of come back with a with 100 hours worth of footage off one shoot. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2901.92s)]
*  And we did six shoots. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2906.0s)]
*  And then you sort of go through that and just gradually sculpt it down [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2907.84s)]
*  to to the characters and the moments in those character stories [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2911.16s)]
*  that you feel are the most interesting or reflect what really happened. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2916.6s)]
*  Now, what is that process like? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2921.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, you said you have these camps. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2923.52s)]
*  Is there electricity in these camps? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2926.08s)]
*  No. So no, nothing. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2928.76s)]
*  I mean, how are you recharging batteries? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2931.0s)]
*  So a combination of solar and generators. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2933.64s)]
*  So we had a couple of generators that we would stick on for [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2937.6s)]
*  sit in little hour slots during the day. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2942.56s)]
*  And that would cover downloading the footage when it came back [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2946.2799999999997s)]
*  and also charging batteries and radios as well. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2950.0s)]
*  So we had a few electrical needs that the you know, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2952.8799999999997s)]
*  the scientists didn't have and weren't set up for. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2956.56s)]
*  So there were some things we needed to do. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2958.8799999999997s)]
*  Yet we had two generators. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2961.2s)]
*  We tried to use them as infrequently as possible because even though [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2963.72s)]
*  they were quiet for a generator, but you still you don't want to be chugging [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2967.3199999999997s)]
*  and away and using up fuel in a sort of low impact situation there. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2971.56s)]
*  But we did need a bit of power. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2977.3999999999996s)]
*  But we were always able to, you know, offload cards and charge batteries. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2980.2799999999997s)]
*  And then we're ready for the next day. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2985.2s)]
*  And then you have to do it again and again and again. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2986.64s)]
*  I would imagine that at the end of the day, there probably has to be a very complex [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2989.4s)]
*  system of organizing what you got and defining it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=2994.44s)]
*  Yeah. And then you have so much footage to be able to go over that [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3000.36s)]
*  and try to piece together a storyline and to know on what cards [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3005.56s)]
*  and what hard drives you have, what data because you're not uploading it anywhere. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3010.6800000000003s)]
*  Correct. Do you know? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3015.36s)]
*  Internet access? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3016.6400000000003s)]
*  No, no, it's all there. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3017.76s)]
*  This is quite technical stuff. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3019.5200000000004s)]
*  If you're interested in it, I can get it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3021.28s)]
*  Please, please. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3023.44s)]
*  So, yeah. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3024.32s)]
*  And we went through loads of sort of working out how we're going to [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3025.6400000000003s)]
*  how do we make sense of this? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3029.0400000000004s)]
*  Did you coordinate this in advance before the expedition began? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3030.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Huge amount of work beforehand on all sorts of things. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3033.4s)]
*  So all the camera. We tested out a ton of cameras. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3038.6400000000003s)]
*  So there's lots of things on the technical camera side [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3043.0800000000004s)]
*  that we had to and that involved going to local forests in the UK. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3046.56s)]
*  This is in terms of capabilities and low light, low light capability [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3050.44s)]
*  and weight and ease of use, because, yeah, not to get distracted [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3054.44s)]
*  by that, I'll come back to the all the logging and things. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3061.08s)]
*  But the camera side, there's a scientist who was one of the first guys out [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3063.6s)]
*  and go called David Watts. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3070.4s)]
*  He's he's a professor at Yale. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3072.2s)]
*  He's a very big deal, very eminent scientist. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3076.0s)]
*  But he chose for his own personal interest to carry around a little camcorder [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3078.52s)]
*  since when not from day one when he was there, but very early [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3084.88s)]
*  from when he first went to see the chimps in the early 90s. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3088.6800000000003s)]
*  He carried around tiny little palm camcorder, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3092.8s)]
*  mini DV tapes or something at the time. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  And he's had various versions over the years as they've got a bit more modern. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3098.28s)]
*  But, you know, something that's about 400 grams [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3101.88s)]
*  that you could just stick in his backpack with a bottle of water. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3104.12s)]
*  Over the years, he's filmed things that no film crew has ever managed to get. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3108.2s)]
*  Now, he films them like a scientist. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3114.8s)]
*  It's video data for him. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3117.2s)]
*  You know, he's not filming it for, you know, it's not 4K Netflix production. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3118.68s)]
*  But he's just film moments in their lives that have just been impossible [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3123.6s)]
*  for film crews carrying enormous equipment, very heavy tripods. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3128.7599999999998s)]
*  So they're stable in the forest, giant long lenses, you know. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3132.84s)]
*  Traditionally, film crews have only really managed to capture [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3136.84s)]
*  small parts of their lives, whereas David [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3141.7200000000003s)]
*  was filming these incredible things regularly. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3146.04s)]
*  Just felt like he had this this amazing access. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3149.2400000000002s)]
*  And I remember thinking, like, if we can find some sweet, some version of that [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3152.36s)]
*  where we have the same level of access that David has, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3156.88s)]
*  but with cameras, with new technology that will deliver [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3161.3199999999997s)]
*  for a sort of 4K Netflix production. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3165.48s)]
*  You know, so in the end, I mean, if I had the camera on the table now, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3168.88s)]
*  you'll be like, well, that doesn't look very small. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3172.0s)]
*  And it was, you know, in the camera crew, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3174.0s)]
*  be like, well, they were quite heavy, actually. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3175.64s)]
*  And you had to carry them around in backpacks. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3177.24s)]
*  But they were they were significantly lighter [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3179.64s)]
*  and easier to use than than things that would normally be used [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3182.92s)]
*  on those sorts of shoes. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3186.7599999999998s)]
*  So that made an enormous difference. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3189.08s)]
*  And I think that but in a way, that's related to this huge volume of footage. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3191.52s)]
*  So we sort of came up with this fantastic setup with the cameras. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3197.6s)]
*  But it allowed these camera people who fit as well [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3202.4s)]
*  and just like super keen to just film all sorts of things [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3207.16s)]
*  that we didn't expect to get. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3211.0s)]
*  Then we have this huge challenge. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3213.6s)]
*  We've got volumes of footage that, you know, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3214.88s)]
*  often with things that you kind of, you know, you might film [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3218.52s)]
*  a grooming scene for sort of two hours. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3221.52s)]
*  And then in the end, you only want to use a few shots of it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3224.0s)]
*  You know, you're still representing what happened there. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3226.64s)]
*  But you've got this huge volume of stuff to cut out. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3228.7599999999998s)]
*  So, yeah, long months before we ever went there. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3232.3999999999996s)]
*  We're trying to work out how are we going to organize this stuff? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3236.4399999999996s)]
*  And we need to organize it like when it's fresh, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3239.2s)]
*  because we need to know who's in that shot. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3243.16s)]
*  We can't just end up in the edit with like 300 hours of like, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3245.72s)]
*  who's that chimp again? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3249.68s)]
*  I think that's Carter. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3251.04s)]
*  You know, you just can't do any of that stuff. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3252.56s)]
*  So I imagine reality series do do a similar thing, actually. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3254.7599999999998s)]
*  This sort of observational docs where you're just filming [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3260.08s)]
*  a ton of people all the time or CCTV style stuff. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3262.9199999999996s)]
*  But for us, we, yeah, we needed to straight away [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3267.16s)]
*  back up the footage and then assess what we had in every single shot. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3270.7599999999998s)]
*  Needs to be logged with which chimps are in that shot [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3275.9599999999996s)]
*  what they're doing, what the conditions. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3280.64s)]
*  And then there's all the data about that's built into it that says when it was. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3283.52s)]
*  And and even in some case, GPS information. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3287.7599999999998s)]
*  So all of that went into every single shot. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3292.2s)]
*  So at the end of it, we've got this enormous library [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3294.12s)]
*  and this cool bit of software where you can go, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3297.4399999999996s)]
*  I'm pretty sure I know the story beats that we've recorded with Gus. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3300.04s)]
*  But let's just type in Gus and bring up every shot of Gus [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3304.0s)]
*  that we got over the year. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3306.68s)]
*  And it would go, and then that's Gus. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3308.48s)]
*  Everything that we've got of Gus. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3312.04s)]
*  And so, you know, we had to. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3314.4s)]
*  Once we knew the characters that we that we wanted to be [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3317.96s)]
*  viewing this story through, we we were able to sort of concentrate on them [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3322.52s)]
*  and sort of build out of the narrative that we that we filmed there. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3329.2s)]
*  Yeah, build build their storylines in parallel to the storylines with the group. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3337.3999999999996s)]
*  Now that there's cell phones that are capable of 4K [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3342.7599999999998s)]
*  and, you know, you're talking about how this one scientist [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3347.16s)]
*  was able to get access with this very small camcorder. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3349.7599999999998s)]
*  Was there any [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3353.08s)]
*  was there any thought of using cell phones? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3355.56s)]
*  Because they're so small now and the cameras are so good. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3359.24s)]
*  They are and they are really good. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3362.3999999999996s)]
*  In the forest, they are less good, actually, because it's a real low light situation. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3365.16s)]
*  So that's, you know, and you don't have the ability with [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3370.7599999999998s)]
*  with cell, you can you can zoom in on most phones, can't you? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3376.7999999999997s)]
*  But the quality goes right down. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3379.8399999999997s)]
*  It's a digital zoom. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3381.3999999999996s)]
*  So you're not using as much of the sensor. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3382.56s)]
*  So although they are extremely impressive [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3385.16s)]
*  and when you're in a situation with loads of light, the images look, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3388.0s)]
*  you know, you can blow them up on a screen like that and they look good. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3391.12s)]
*  But they don't actually compare to sort of professional cameras [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3394.12s)]
*  in that type of situation. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3398.48s)]
*  But when you're talking about this one scientist that had this very tiny camera [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3401.16s)]
*  and all the incredible footage that he was able to get, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3404.76s)]
*  I would imagine that with cell phones today, particularly with these, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3407.68s)]
*  there's various add on lenses that you can little cases [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3410.56s)]
*  that you could put on a small cell phone. Yeah. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3414.08s)]
*  You know what it wasn't we I don't think we didn't think about it a lot [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3416.96s)]
*  on because of the the assumptions at the time was that [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3420.88s)]
*  it still wasn't going to be quite enough. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3426.0s)]
*  But I agree. I mean, I think there's, you know, you'd certainly [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3428.12s)]
*  they would be recording at a level that you wouldn't have been able to before. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3433.0s)]
*  I still think we are compromised was to try and get the highest quality possible [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3438.32s)]
*  whilst getting that access. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3444.1600000000003s)]
*  So, like I say, if I actually got the camera out now, you'd be going, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3446.6s)]
*  well, it looks like it looks like a pretty big deal. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3450.28s)]
*  You know, it's bigger. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3453.0s)]
*  It's bigger than these cameras, for instance. But [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3453.6800000000003s)]
*  but it was still relatively small compared to most sort of nature show setups. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3457.28s)]
*  So when you're filming, you film for 400 days. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3464.1600000000003s)]
*  Like, how long is that editing process? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3467.96s)]
*  So we went through like a huge pre editing process, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3471.52s)]
*  which is what I was talking about earlier, going from that. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3476.2s)]
*  Right. This is everything that we've shot, reducing it right down to, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3479.84s)]
*  you know, the best bits and the most relevant scenes that we'd filmed. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3485.04s)]
*  You know, Gus is quite a good example. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3491.28s)]
*  We would, you know, film him for hours, not not doing very much and looking [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3492.64s)]
*  like he was struggling socially and, you know, so there's you don't actually [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3497.68s)]
*  need to make that point and to share that experience with the viewer. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3502.16s)]
*  You only actually need a small amount of that. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3505.8399999999997s)]
*  So there's a phase of it where you sort of just reduce it down to everything [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3508.64s)]
*  that you think, boil it right down. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3513.4399999999996s)]
*  This was the story that we recorded in its most representative chunks. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3515.56s)]
*  And that really helps. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3522.7599999999998s)]
*  You get it right down to a manageable level and then [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3524.7200000000003s)]
*  and then looking at that and thinking, OK, well, how's this going? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3529.92s)]
*  How are we going to divide up these this this this narrative [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3533.32s)]
*  across four four episodes? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3538.28s)]
*  And and there's obviously that's where we had quite a lot of choice. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3541.8s)]
*  You know, it's the story unfolded in a particular way. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3545.7200000000003s)]
*  But we we could choose when to introduce the different groups [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3551.04s)]
*  and we could choose how much to expand certain parts of the story [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3556.7999999999997s)]
*  and then how much to to sort of compress [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3561.3599999999997s)]
*  times during that that narrative that we that we recorded. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3565.7999999999997s)]
*  So there are quite a lot of creative choices there. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3570.7599999999998s)]
*  Like say that the the overall the series at the end, that that that's what happened. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3573.56s)]
*  But there's a whole load of bits that we sort of, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3578.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, compressed because you didn't necessarily need to see this [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3582.48s)]
*  this period between that and that. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3586.48s)]
*  And it and it wasn't it wasn't relevant for the story. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3588.64s)]
*  But yeah, editing. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3592.6s)]
*  So a lot of work done before the edit, because you can't, you know, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3594.6s)]
*  you couldn't have expected any editors to come in and just go, well, you know, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3598.2799999999997s)]
*  that's right, that's the rushes. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3601.64s)]
*  Make it make us a good opening show, really. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3603.56s)]
*  And so loads of work done before the editors got on board. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3606.32s)]
*  But then, yeah, four different editors. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3613.32s)]
*  About 20 weeks per episode. Wow. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3616.92s)]
*  Yeah, so what's that like five months or something? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3624.0800000000004s)]
*  But but, you know, that that sounds like a really long time and it is. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3626.2000000000003s)]
*  But you you have to be in a position to share a cut with. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3630.1200000000003s)]
*  In this case, Netflix, about halfway through that process. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3635.0s)]
*  So actually, you know. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3638.96s)]
*  You know, putting together [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3641.04s)]
*  a show that really that really works and and and illustrates [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3644.6000000000004s)]
*  the story that you've captured in a dramatic way. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3649.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it takes quite a lot of work, and that needs to be [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3655.4s)]
*  that needs to be representative of where you're going by the time you first show it. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3657.84s)]
*  I would imagine that's one of the biggest challenges of this whole [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3662.6800000000003s)]
*  piece, this whole series. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3665.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, lots of different challenges along along the way. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3668.7200000000003s)]
*  And in some ways, like each time you knock off one of the challenges, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3673.0s)]
*  you know, you feel a bit more relaxed about it. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3677.4s)]
*  I personally I love being in the edit. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3680.48s)]
*  Sort of my happy place. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3683.4s)]
*  I mean, I like I like being in the field. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3685.4s)]
*  I used to like it more when I was younger and fit or actually like it. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3687.2000000000003s)]
*  It's getting hard. It's harder. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3691.96s)]
*  I mean, I'm not it's not like an old man or anything, but like the [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3693.44s)]
*  camera crews are younger and fitter than I am and and lighter. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3696.36s)]
*  But the edit is, you know, that's [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3702.1600000000003s)]
*  I love that part of the process. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3706.5600000000004s)]
*  And, you know, you can really [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3709.0800000000004s)]
*  things can be, you know, you can edit shows in a lot of different ways. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3712.96s)]
*  And and the sort of style and tone and and the music and things, a lot of the sort of. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3716.44s)]
*  A lot of the the overall feel of the series starts to come come to life. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3724.0s)]
*  So and I think we we are fantastic editor Sam Rogers, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3728.76s)]
*  who I've worked with a few times before, and he was he did the first episode [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3733.88s)]
*  and he did a really, really good job, great instincts for it. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3739.76s)]
*  And we were very well prepared. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3743.08s)]
*  And we, you know, initially we didn't do any sort of narration on it because [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3745.48s)]
*  we wanted to sort of do a test of like, how much can you for how much are you going to [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3752.4s)]
*  just engage with these chimps and not be told what's happening [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3756.16s)]
*  or what might be about to happen or what that means? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3762.08s)]
*  Just let's just do without any commentary at all to start with. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3764.8s)]
*  And and it was a fantastic exercise because then we showed Sarah [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3769.52s)]
*  at Netflix that that first car and everyone loved it and you could follow it. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3773.88s)]
*  And you were just like, you were right in there. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3779.12s)]
*  And, you know, in a way, I sort of in some ways I miss that first version [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3781.44s)]
*  because it was kind of it was an odd experience, just sort of like, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3785.36s)]
*  no, just we are just going to be following the chimps and the edit and the music [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3788.92s)]
*  and the sound is going to sort of tell us what's happening here. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3794.4s)]
*  You might have liked that because it was a very sort of just direct experience [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3798.7200000000003s)]
*  with the chimps. Have you thought about releasing a different version [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3803.28s)]
*  that doesn't have narration? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3807.32s)]
*  And that seems to give so much footage. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3809.7200000000003s)]
*  And I mean, I would imagine that it's just more people watching. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3812.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3817.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, in the end, because we've got Mahesh Allali and and [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3818.1600000000003s)]
*  I loved that part of the process as well. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3822.32s)]
*  So I think in in the end, you know, I thought it was a great exercise. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3825.52s)]
*  But actually, you know, we wanted it to reach a broad audience. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3829.88s)]
*  We did want another layer of thought process there and [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3834.8s)]
*  and some interpretation. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3840.52s)]
*  And, you know, Mahesh Allali did a fantastic job. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3843.84s)]
*  And I think that, you know, yeah, there are other voices [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3847.88s)]
*  we could have had on it that I may have sort of regretted [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3851.84s)]
*  and that may have taken something away from that. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3855.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that that was, yeah, for me, that sort of confirmed that, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3858.1600000000003s)]
*  yeah, we lucked out with Mahesh and he was fantastic [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3863.8s)]
*  because it gave it something else. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3867.0400000000004s)]
*  It gave it an extra sort of conceptual layer [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3869.0s)]
*  that I think really, really helps. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3874.36s)]
*  But certainly makes it more relatable to humans. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3876.1600000000003s)]
*  It does. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3879.4s)]
*  It makes it easier to follow along, especially if someone is not [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3881.0s)]
*  like completely fascinated with just observing chimp behavior with no narration. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3884.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the thing is, is what you can't like stylistically. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3889.56s)]
*  There's whole sections that you could follow, actually, without any narration. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3895.44s)]
*  But then that becomes quite an unusual experience. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3900.64s)]
*  If you're just like you go like 20 minutes without hearing a word. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3903.2s)]
*  And then and then Mahesh all pops up because they're actually you need some [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3906.64s)]
*  you need to know something here about what's at stake. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3910.44s)]
*  You know, and that's often how we sort of tried to shape [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3914.48s)]
*  the narration was sort of on a need to know basis. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3918.32s)]
*  And, you know, I think we, you know, because the voice really worked, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3923.1600000000003s)]
*  we sort of decide to use it a little bit more. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3928.88s)]
*  But our initial approach was, well, I think it's in situations. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3932.36s)]
*  You know, for instance, Gus going to groom Abrams or whatever. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3938.44s)]
*  You need to know what's at stake there. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3942.64s)]
*  You need to know that he doesn't he doesn't actually have any grooming partners [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3945.64s)]
*  and that this is, you know, this sort of opportunity [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3952.64s)]
*  with a chimp like Abrams could could change his situation. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3956.44s)]
*  And you could, you know, partly you could follow that visually. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3961.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think it really it helped sort of really solidifying [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3964.4s)]
*  some of those thoughts. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3970.28s)]
*  You have so much footage and four shows. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3972.32s)]
*  Has there been thought about expanding this and doing more episodes? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3976.28s)]
*  I mean, I think it will be hard because we sort of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3983.36s)]
*  because the series covers the sort of the true chronology of events. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3986.88s)]
*  So all all the sort of real drama, real things that happened [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3991.9199999999996s)]
*  throughout that period, you know, represented in the series. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=3998.4399999999996s)]
*  So quite a lot of the footage that we didn't use are just sort of [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4003.3999999999996s)]
*  other examples of the same thing that we didn't, you know, less descriptive [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4007.68s)]
*  versions of, you know, all repeated behaviors and things. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4012.4399999999996s)]
*  So there wasn't a lot of things that you sort of feel, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4017.0s)]
*  you sort of feel the whole another show in there. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4020.2s)]
*  And also, they weren't things that, you know, how the series concludes. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4022.32s)]
*  That was that was really at the end of our final shoot. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4027.04s)]
*  So the footage that we have is sort of supporting material [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4030.84s)]
*  for everything that's sort of out there. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4036.08s)]
*  And but I mean, you know, the story still continues in GoGo. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4038.04s)]
*  You know, things are still [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4046.04s)]
*  going on there and still changing. Do you get updates? Yeah. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4048.4s)]
*  So we I mean, we're we're we're pretty close to all the scientists there [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4052.6s)]
*  and have been for years, you know, with with friends and stay in touch. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4058.36s)]
*  I'm seeing one tonight, actually, who lives in Austin. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4065.2000000000003s)]
*  But they they are often [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4068.44s)]
*  texting things that are happening now that they know we'd be interested in. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4073.12s)]
*  Now, has there been thought about doing another series? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4078.16s)]
*  And because this is obviously been very successful. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4082.0s)]
*  Well, you know, I think I mean, it's hard to say, you know, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4085.6s)]
*  it's only been a few weeks, so it's hard to say how how successful it is yet. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4088.7200000000003s)]
*  Because Netflix doesn't tell you, no, they're crafty with that. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4095.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's obviously anecdotally from people that I know. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4100.4s)]
*  I mean, so many people recommended it before I watched it. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4103.16s)]
*  I got so many text messages like you must watch this. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4106.16s)]
*  This is right up your alley. So many people told me about it. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4108.84s)]
*  Well, I think I think because of your interest, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4112.16s)]
*  though, you might get a bit of a bias on the sort of like overall conversation [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4114.360000000001s)]
*  on it, maybe. I don't know. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4118.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, I'm assuming because people know you're in the chimps. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4119.64s)]
*  I think, yeah, I mean, and I read the Twitter feed each day. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4125.68s)]
*  I can't resist or refresh that and see what people are saying about it. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4128.6s)]
*  And really, yeah, I'm really excited about the feedback. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4131.88s)]
*  You should be. But I don't know. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4138.96s)]
*  Yeah, whether it's going to get bigger or bigger or or who knows? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4140.84s)]
*  I mean, I personally and the whole team who who are involved in it, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4145.8s)]
*  you just kind of fall in love with that place and the people who work there [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4152.24s)]
*  and the and all the chimps, you know, whether we were filming or not, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4156.360000000001s)]
*  you kind of just you want to find out what's happening, what's happening [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4160.72s)]
*  and go because you're following that story, whether you film it or not. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4162.96s)]
*  And I think we'll always be on a sort of like, you know, we want to find out [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4165.8s)]
*  is Abrams in charge? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4170.96s)]
*  You know, and. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4173.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's things that are happening that we're constantly being updated about. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4175.6s)]
*  We we we'd love to go into a second season, but I think that's, you know, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4180.04s)]
*  quite an undertaking. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4184.68s)]
*  It's a huge undertaking. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4186.200000000001s)]
*  But I think we learned so much on the first one [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4187.72s)]
*  that I mean, you know, a lot of the pain about how to do it. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4191.68s)]
*  We sort of we it will be a much easier thing second time around. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4196.6s)]
*  But also seems like one of the most unusual situations [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4201.4400000000005s)]
*  where there has been these embedded scientists in this area for 30 years. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4206.76s)]
*  And these chimps are so accustomed to it. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4211.76s)]
*  I mean, it's like to try to reestablish that somewhere else. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4213.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is a very unusual group of chimpanzees, too, right? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4218.400000000001s)]
*  It is. I mean, there are other chimpanzee sites, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4222.320000000001s)]
*  several of the chimpanzee sites around Africa where where they have a similar, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4225.88s)]
*  you know, the chimps are habituated long term scientific projects. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4230.8s)]
*  You know, Jane Jane Goodall being a perfect example, you know, here [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4235.04s)]
*  her project has been there long before the guys are studying in GoGo. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4238.400000000001s)]
*  So that's much longer term. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4241.6s)]
*  You know, the study sites in time in the Ivory Coast. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4243.92s)]
*  And Fongoli, you know, there's many of them. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4247.72s)]
*  What's unique about NgoGo is as well as having that level of access and data [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4252.64s)]
*  and sort of so you just have so much information about the chimps. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4259.280000000001s)]
*  But there's also just a ton of chimps and and they are quite unique [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4262.56s)]
*  in that the NgoGo territory is surrounded by forest in every direction, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4267.72s)]
*  whereas at other sites often, you know, chimpanzee habitat [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4273.96s)]
*  sort of bordered by farmland or human settlements of some kind. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4278.48s)]
*  So they're quite sort of that's a little wild pocket [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4284.799999999999s)]
*  in amongst an area that is less wild. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4289.16s)]
*  At NgoGo, and I think this is unique for study sites of chimps. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4292.679999999999s)]
*  They have it's wild in every direction outside of there. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4297.599999999999s)]
*  So that does impact their their behaviour and their sort of group dynamics, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4301.44s)]
*  because the edge of their territory is not like some land they can't go on. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4306.96s)]
*  It's land they can take because it belongs to other chimps. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4313.32s)]
*  And so and, you know, whether you [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4316.08s)]
*  whether you enjoy watching the aspect of chimpanzee behaviour or not, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4321.24s)]
*  there's a there's another layer to what to what happens in NgoGo. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4325.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, loads of other chimpanzee sites, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4331.2s)]
*  but they have different things that they do, you know, for instance, in [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4333.5199999999995s)]
*  in in Fongoli in Senegal, they use spears to hunt bush babies. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4337.32s)]
*  You know, this sort of this in every little in every different chimpanzee site. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4342.92s)]
*  There's like an associated unique behaviour or or culture. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4348.28s)]
*  Scientists wouldn't call it culture, but, you know, a simple way of looking at it. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4354.76s)]
*  There's a different like sort of things that they do [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4358.36s)]
*  that are that are separate and different to other chimpanzees. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4362.599999999999s)]
*  So you've there's observed chimpanzees that use spears. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4365.799999999999s)]
*  There are. Yeah, I haven't observed any any of them at all. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4370.04s)]
*  It's not I've never I've never been there or filmed that. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4373.32s)]
*  But yes, they they use sticks. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4376.16s)]
*  Do they sharpen these sticks? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4379.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4381.599999999999s)]
*  And my partner is he actually made a film about those chimps. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4382.88s)]
*  We're quite chimp in our household. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4387.68s)]
*  And and she she'll be able to answer that better. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4390.320000000001s)]
*  But I know that they use they use spears. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4392.96s)]
*  And I think they make spears. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4397.0s)]
*  So I don't know whether they sharpen them, but they certainly strip them down [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4399.400000000001s)]
*  so that they are like a spear. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4404.12s)]
*  And they and they jab in holes for bush babies. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4407.72s)]
*  What is a bush baby? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4412.04s)]
*  It's like a little nocturnal primate. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4413.6s)]
*  They're very, very cute. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4416.88s)]
*  Oh, boy. Oh, no. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4418.84s)]
*  How conflicted is that? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4420.52s)]
*  Watch. I mean, it just watch them tear the monkeys apart with their hands. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4422.4800000000005s)]
*  I know. But having them use weapons and spear them. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4426.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, chimpanzees, you know, use tools since Jane. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4431.12s)]
*  Well, Jane Goodwin, they've used tools probably for thousands, thousands of years. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4436.76s)]
*  We don't know. But, you know, Jane Goodall discovered that many years ago. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4439.96s)]
*  So making not just using tools, but making tools. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4445.639999999999s)]
*  It's quite cool, isn't it? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4451.16s)]
*  It is so cool. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4452.28s)]
*  Interestingly, the Ngo Ngo chimps, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4453.44s)]
*  they do occasionally use a tool for something or other, but they're not like [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4456.88s)]
*  in West Africa. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4463.16s)]
*  In the Ivory Coast, the chimpanzees, they use big rocks to crack nuts [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4466.48s)]
*  and they use sticks to fish for ants. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4472.08s)]
*  And same thing in Gombe and, like I say, in Fongoli, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4475.8s)]
*  they use spears for bush babies. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4480.72s)]
*  So tool use is quite a big thing for for chimps generally around Africa. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4482.48s)]
*  But at Ngo Ngo, they're not big tool users. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4488.12s)]
*  And it's interesting. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4493.04s)]
*  They maybe have just never, you know, tools are a solution to a problem [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4493.92s)]
*  for the chimps that identify that they need something [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4498.24s)]
*  and that tool will help get it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4501.96s)]
*  And it feels that Ngo Ngo that. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4504.6s)]
*  Actually, they're not they've not really had that need [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4507.72s)]
*  and because of the fruit and because of the prevalence of monkeys. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4511.56s)]
*  Maybe it's it's such a rich environment, loads of fruit. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4515.240000000001s)]
*  They've just they've hammered the monkeys there. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4519.6s)]
*  I remember, yeah, John Watani, one of the scientists saying, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4523.76s)]
*  yeah, Ngo Ngo, they don't, you know, they don't use a lot of tools. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4529.6s)]
*  They cooperate on really interesting levels. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4532.84s)]
*  That's the thing that feels that is the identifying [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4536.88s)]
*  or the defining quality of the Ngo Ngo group. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4542.4800000000005s)]
*  It's their sheer population, the population size. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4544.88s)]
*  They're just a massive group. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4548.12s)]
*  And maybe as a function of that, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4552.2s)]
*  there's levels of cooperative behavior there that they they achieve [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4554.360000000001s)]
*  those getting the things that they want through cooperation. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4559.32s)]
*  Robin tool use when you're observing them [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4562.84s)]
*  hunting after monkeys, is there speculation that there's two things going on [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4566.76s)]
*  that they're hunting the monkeys for food, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4572.400000000001s)]
*  but also that they're preventing the monkeys from eating the fruit [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4574.4400000000005s)]
*  because they must be in competition with the monkeys for these prized resources. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4578.04s)]
*  Because, of course, the monkeys eat fruit as well. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4583.64s)]
*  They do. I don't think that's a that's a thing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4586.360000000001s)]
*  But you might. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4591.64s)]
*  I think the overriding things, they're just like hunting the monkeys. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4592.68s)]
*  Because the thing is that that does exist with other with other animals, rather, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4597.72s)]
*  with predators. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4601.44s)]
*  I think that coyotes, one of the reasons why they target cats [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4602.36s)]
*  is not just for food, but the cats are also predators. Yeah. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4605.52s)]
*  You know what? I don't know. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4610.4s)]
*  And I don't think I've ever really asked that specifically to the to the scientists [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4611.56s)]
*  there, but I'm guessing the [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4615.6s)]
*  the so much fruit around the, you know, those sorts of things [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4619.84s)]
*  might be driven by like a scarcity of food. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4624.84s)]
*  So therefore, like, you know, take out your competitor for that food. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4628.4s)]
*  And I think what they probably say was that, you know, it's such a rich environment. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4633.5199999999995s)]
*  And actually, they just seem to love hunting monkeys, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4638.639999999999s)]
*  which is a shame, you know. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4643.04s)]
*  Is it a shame? I don't know. I don't know. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4644.76s)]
*  Well, it's hard. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4647.639999999999s)]
*  You know, I feel I've been desensitized to it a little bit. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4649.44s)]
*  So, you know, obviously, don't go, yes, they've got that monkey. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4653.2s)]
*  Of course. No, but but you accept it and you. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4656.32s)]
*  Yeah, you don't. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4662.44s)]
*  I think if you're following the Ngogo chimps, you. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4663.5599999999995s)]
*  You're sort of like on some level, you're kind of with them, really. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4668.16s)]
*  And therefore, you know, you're not you're not like, you're not rooting for them. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4672.04s)]
*  You don't really want them to do that, but you totally accept that they do. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4677.08s)]
*  But, you know, in previous years, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4681.68s)]
*  the the used to be a lot more monkeys there. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4684.6s)]
*  So that the chimps are actually having a probably negative [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4687.72s)]
*  a probably negative impact on the numbers of the monkeys. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4693.64s)]
*  But is this just they have a very specific territory? Yeah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4697.68s)]
*  And this is just in their territory. Yeah. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4701.400000000001s)]
*  They're having a big impact. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4703.68s)]
*  So is there a prevalence of monkeys outside of their territory? [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4704.84s)]
*  And do they ever go outside of their territory specifically to try to target monkeys? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4708.04s)]
*  I know they go to areas of their territory [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4714.32s)]
*  or areas at the edge of their territory where they know there are more monkeys still. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4717.6s)]
*  Because, yeah, one time monkeys were much more common within their territory. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4723.72s)]
*  You know, they'd avoid the chimps or whatever. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4728.76s)]
*  But there was a known there were known groups of monkeys there. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4730.4800000000005s)]
*  And and now there are less because they're so effective at hunting them. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4735.16s)]
*  Yeah. There's a there's one of the images of this torso of a monkey, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4739.64s)]
*  and they're just eating it. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4745.52s)]
*  And it's it's so weird because there's just something that's just so uniquely disturbing [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4747.52s)]
*  about watching a primate eat a primate. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4754.76s)]
*  I know. Yeah, see, it's like, I mean, it is what they do. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4758.88s)]
*  It is. Yeah. You unfortunately, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4763.76s)]
*  if you if you follow chimps and a lot of, you know, a lot of chim groups do that. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4767.96s)]
*  In fact, everywhere where you find chimps and monkeys in the same place, it happens, I think. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4772.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is part of what they do. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4779.0s)]
*  Do you find yourself rooting for the monkey to get away? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4781.4400000000005s)]
*  Or do you find yourself rooting for the chimp to get the monkey? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4784.12s)]
*  I mean, yeah, because you kind of want to capture the the actual successful hunt. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4786.68s)]
*  I don't know. Not not necessarily, actually. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4793.56s)]
*  No. And I think the you know, particularly the type of thing that we were doing, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4796.4s)]
*  it wasn't sort of, you know, we want that behavior. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4801.36s)]
*  And we weren't going out to get behavior sequences. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4804.08s)]
*  We just want to film what happened. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4806.2s)]
*  And in and in a way, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4808.44s)]
*  them attempting to hunt something and failing is is also an interesting story. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4811.0s)]
*  Does it happen often where they attempt to hunt monkeys and the monkeys get away? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4816.76s)]
*  It does. It does happen. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4821.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, not not very often. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4823.200000000001s)]
*  Most of the time they're successful. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4824.92s)]
*  Yes, I think so. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4826.4800000000005s)]
*  And you do. I mean, having said I was a bit desensitized to it, I think, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4828.0s)]
*  you know, that what the natural thing is, you're seeing a much bigger animal [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4833.240000000001s)]
*  go after a much smaller animal. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4837.68s)]
*  So in almost everybody, there's an underdog there. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4839.76s)]
*  And there's, you know, you kind of you are on some level thinking, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4843.56s)]
*  come on, if you just get out to that skinny tree, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4849.12s)]
*  get out that skinny branch, they won't follow you there. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4851.48s)]
*  You know, because that's the that's the challenge on. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4854.2s)]
*  The monkeys try and get out right on the tips of the branches, which are, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4857.4s)]
*  you know, they won't they won't hold the chimps white. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4860.96s)]
*  So that's the safe bit. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4863.879999999999s)]
*  But then but then it's quite a precarious position because where do you go from there? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4865.2s)]
*  You're just kind of delaying things, really. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4870.48s)]
*  Because they know exactly where you are. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4873.44s)]
*  It's hard because, you know, those monkeys are [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4874.799999999999s)]
*  their complex creatures as well. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4878.44s)]
*  Yeah. And I think, you know, if we were we were focusing on them a lot, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4880.679999999999s)]
*  we'd start to engage with them as individuals and, you know, would [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4885.32s)]
*  it would feel different. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4889.839999999999s)]
*  And it's important to remember that. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4891.24s)]
*  But, you know, the purpose of this series was [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4893.2s)]
*  we wanted to experience what it was like to be in and go go chimpanzee. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4897.799999999999s)]
*  From their perspective, monkeys are food. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4901.759999999999s)]
*  Did you observe noticeable patterns in how they hunt [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4904.96s)]
*  or strategies of how they hunt these monkeys? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4909.92s)]
*  No, not I mean, not really. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4916.44s)]
*  Other than, like I said, there are sort of stages to it where, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4919.2s)]
*  you know, it's not. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4924.8s)]
*  They'll just suddenly start hunting. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4926.639999999999s)]
*  They'll they'll be a process where [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4929.76s)]
*  one of the chimps might hear some monkeys or [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4934.679999999999s)]
*  they might have gone looking for them in a particular area. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4938.84s)]
*  And there's there's different stages where they kind of know [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4942.16s)]
*  there's monkeys in the area and they're sort of feeling their way around. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4945.16s)]
*  And then maybe they've heard a call and they're sort of making their way [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4948.04s)]
*  gradually over there. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4950.599999999999s)]
*  And then when they identify an opportunity, right? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4952.679999999999s)]
*  OK, there is there's a group of monkeys here and they're up in that tree. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4958.08s)]
*  And then they can often be very quiet, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4962.08s)]
*  a bit like being on patrol at that point where, you know, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4965.360000000001s)]
*  they're just kind of getting as close as they can and in positions [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4969.08s)]
*  where they can be most effective [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4973.56s)]
*  without making any noise and without scaring anything off. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4976.52s)]
*  And then generally, it sort of it takes just one chip to just go for it. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4981.96s)]
*  And then and then the chase is on. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4987.0s)]
*  So there's no element of surprise or anything. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4988.88s)]
*  It's just it's a rush. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4991.12s)]
*  And they're trying to corner the monkey or monkeys [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4993.36s)]
*  in positions in the trees where they can get to them. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=4998.5199999999995s)]
*  One of the things that they observed in the David Attenborough [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5001.44s)]
*  capturing of this sort of behavior was that they will sort of ambush them. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5006.4s)]
*  They will set up traps. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5010.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's I think a lot of people sort of have different opinions [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5013.599999999999s)]
*  about this, and I think probably every hunt is different. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5018.32s)]
*  And I think sometimes you might observe those things and then. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5023.32s)]
*  In your mind, get a sense that, oh, this is how they must do it. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5029.84s)]
*  Because during that hunt, he was over there and he was over there. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5032.96s)]
*  And they appeared to do that. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5036.84s)]
*  In my experience, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5040.04s)]
*  the didn't seem to be that sort of pattern of behavior. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5042.8s)]
*  It was it was not it was not as organized [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5046.04s)]
*  as that actually when it came to to those parts of the hunt. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5049.68s)]
*  Also, it's very difficult thing to observe and to film. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5055.92s)]
*  So you really having said we're getting amazing details of their lives. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5059.92s)]
*  And but there are some activities that they do like a hunt. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5066.08s)]
*  Why really? I mean, you're looking through windows in the canopy [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5071.08s)]
*  and just you see a chip leg it across there and over there. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5074.44s)]
*  And then suddenly someone's got the monkey and making sense of that. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5078.36s)]
*  You know, I think scientifically it's really hard. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5082.32s)]
*  But from filmmaking point of view, you're you're capturing moments [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5085.2s)]
*  and and you can piece together what's happened there. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5089.839999999999s)]
*  But there's definitely things that haven't that you haven't seen. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5092.759999999999s)]
*  They've gone on behind trees or leaves or so. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5095.879999999999s)]
*  I think it's hard. It's hard to kind of know exactly how they do it. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5099.12s)]
*  Is there any concern while you're doing this that you're interfering [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5104.0s)]
*  in some sort of a way or that you're going to upset them, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5108.16s)]
*  that you're getting in the way of the hunt or getting in the way [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5111.12s)]
*  of their natural behaviors? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5113.679999999999s)]
*  It's a it's a constant consideration. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5116.04s)]
*  How? You know, the worst thing we could possibly do [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5119.639999999999s)]
*  is to go in there and try and observe the sort of real world of the [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5124.2s)]
*  of the Ngo Ngo chimpanzees and then find ourselves having [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5129.16s)]
*  an impact on that being sort of participating in it. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5133.36s)]
*  So that's not that's no longer the real world of the chimpanzees. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5135.92s)]
*  That's the world of the Ngo Ngo chimps when they're sort of distracted [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5139.96s)]
*  or impacted by human observers. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5144.16s)]
*  So that, you know, that would be that would just ruin the whole point of it. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5146.5199999999995s)]
*  So it's a constant consideration. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5150.88s)]
*  Weirdly, and it does. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5155.44s)]
*  I don't really have an explanation for it, and I've not really heard one [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5157.32s)]
*  that works for me that oddly. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5160.92s)]
*  Apart from sort of acknowledging you. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5165.28s)]
*  And they just don't seem [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5168.36s)]
*  to be impacted by your presence at all, they pretty much ignore you. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5172.76s)]
*  And like chimpanzees are so like spatially aware, like they they [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5177.76s)]
*  they live in this three dimensional forest world [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5185.56s)]
*  where they can just go from tree to tree, horizontal, vertical. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5188.719999999999s)]
*  They just they're very aware of everything that's around them. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5192.36s)]
*  You would assume in these chaotic moments that, you know, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5197.879999999999s)]
*  you might get in one's way or run into it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5201.04s)]
*  It never happens. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5203.28s)]
*  And it's as if but but then again, you never see a chimpanzee run into a tree. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5204.799999999999s)]
*  You know, they they know where everything is. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5209.5599999999995s)]
*  And for some bizarre reason, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5212.799999999999s)]
*  they're they're totally accepting of this sort of passive presence in the forest. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5215.28s)]
*  These strange bipedal creatures that sort of follow [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5220.08s)]
*  and are close and sort of within observing them. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5224.24s)]
*  And it's not like they, you know, they acknowledge they acknowledge you. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5229.04s)]
*  They know you're there. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5231.639999999999s)]
*  They're not just like, like I said earlier, you're not spying on them. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5232.719999999999s)]
*  You're you're kind of part of it. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5236.24s)]
*  But they're not interested in you. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5239.0s)]
*  Hmm. It's strange. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5241.24s)]
*  And until you're there and you're in it, it's it's it's sort of an impossible [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5243.719999999999s)]
*  thing to describe, and it's a very difficult thing to understand [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5248.959999999999s)]
*  until you're actually right there. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5252.44s)]
*  And I think when, you know, when something's kicking off [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5255.0s)]
*  and there's a lot of like excitement and chaos within the group, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5258.24s)]
*  if you haven't experienced that before, it's intimidating [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5262.4s)]
*  and you can't quite believe that you're not somehow going to get swept up on it. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5265.32s)]
*  But but you don't at all. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5270.48s)]
*  And they, you know, there's been decades of this happening at Ngogo [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5273.12s)]
*  where they're just they accept this sort of passive presence in the forest. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5278.48s)]
*  I mean, it must be so weird. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5283.879999999999s)]
*  You're there when they get up, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5286.28s)]
*  you know, and you follow them around all day and. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5289.919999999999s)]
*  You know, when they take a shit, when they're making friends [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5294.5199999999995s)]
*  with somebody, when they're doing anything that they're doing, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5299.400000000001s)]
*  you know, and you're just you're there. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5302.4800000000005s)]
*  But they they appear. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5305.16s)]
*  Not to mind at all, and it doesn't appear to impact their behavior at all. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5308.92s)]
*  That's so fascinating. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5312.96s)]
*  How close do they get to the photographers, the humans, the camera people? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5314.88s)]
*  So, you know, there are there are strict rules at Ngogo [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5321.400000000001s)]
*  and anywhere working with chimpanzees because because we're so similar, [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5326.4s)]
*  they're they're susceptible and vulnerable to sort of human infections. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5331.32s)]
*  So even things that don't really bother us like a cough. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5336.16s)]
*  If we had a cough or a cold, that would be quite dangerous to transmit. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5338.5599999999995s)]
*  Was this during Covid that you filmed all this? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5343.24s)]
*  You know, we started just after lockdown. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5345.36s)]
*  But we had sort of we were prepared to do it before Covid [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5349.08s)]
*  kicked in and Covid happened and the world shut down. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5352.96s)]
*  And then we got out there as soon as we could afterwards, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5356.28s)]
*  when things were starting to open up, you know, because Uganda [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5359.5199999999995s)]
*  wouldn't let any flights in for a long time. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5362.32s)]
*  But as soon as they did, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5364.16s)]
*  and we went out there and and we had to be tested regularly for Covid. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5366.2s)]
*  People were worried about [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5372.44s)]
*  what would happen if a chipmunk got Covid. Right. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5374.5199999999995s)]
*  Naturally, very worried. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5377.4s)]
*  But actually in place already, there was were, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5378.84s)]
*  you know, you have to wear masks. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5384.04s)]
*  You can't go closer than seven meters. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5385.5199999999995s)]
*  You you have, you know, if you're not feeling well or anything like that, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5388.92s)]
*  you mustn't go and see the chimps. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5393.16s)]
*  And that's important because, yeah, chimps, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5396.92s)]
*  a common cold can be lethal to to chimps. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5400.84s)]
*  So, yeah, so so for that reason, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5406.4s)]
*  you have to stay seven meters away from them in the forest. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5410.4s)]
*  It's not much. It's not. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5414.24s)]
*  No, I mean, they say seven meters is an absolute bare minimum. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5416.4s)]
*  They encourage you to about 10 meters. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5421.0s)]
*  That is 20 feet. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5423.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's not a lot. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5425.76s)]
*  So how far is that? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5426.599999999999s)]
*  Nothing that's across this room. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5427.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, so it's about about the length of this room. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5429.28s)]
*  That's is about the distance you should be. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5433.68s)]
*  And you and you make you you make concerted effort to make sure [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5437.92s)]
*  that's the case. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5442.400000000001s)]
*  However, you know, like I said, the chimps don't know that rule. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5443.76s)]
*  So you can do whatever you can to maintain that distance. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5447.76s)]
*  And, you know, if they come a little closer or come to sit down [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5452.6s)]
*  sort of, you know, within that seven meters, you you move back slowly. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5456.400000000001s)]
*  But you don't you don't, you know, it's not advisable to sort of jump out of the way [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5461.88s)]
*  or, you know, you take your opportunity and slowly [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5465.08s)]
*  get that distance between you back. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5469.4s)]
*  So but yet doesn't feel like a lot at all, particularly if there are chimps [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5472.32s)]
*  in in every direction. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5476.28s)]
*  And because the go go group so big, it can be a lot. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5479.24s)]
*  You can be in the middle of quite an amazing thing. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5482.0s)]
*  And like that, you know, I mean, I know, you know, the excitement [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5486.16s)]
*  or some of the most dramatic parts of chimpanzee life and go go. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5489.84s)]
*  You know, is the the patrolling and a lot of the slightly more aggressive elements. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5496.08s)]
*  But most of the chimps [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5501.5199999999995s)]
*  days spent doing things that are just really enjoyable to be around. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5504.96s)]
*  You know, when they're watching chimps groom is one of the most sort of like relaxing. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5511.2s)]
*  Like you're I mean, it looks so relaxing. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5515.96s)]
*  It's kind of like it has quite a sobrietic effect on you. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5519.6s)]
*  Like if you're in amongst a group of chimps [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5523.12s)]
*  and they're all sort of gently grooming each other, you feel very sleepy. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5526.56s)]
*  It's quite odd. Just watching it. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5530.2s)]
*  It just looks so, you know, it's very gentle. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5533.04s)]
*  You know, these huge males who are. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5537.64s)]
*  Capable of all sorts of things, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5540.4800000000005s)]
*  very tenderly sort of groom each other or younger members of the group [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5544.04s)]
*  or the females and like it really it looks so gentle. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5548.72s)]
*  They're just going finally going through each of the hairs there [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5552.679999999999s)]
*  and just really checking with anything that was coming out. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5555.36s)]
*  And they just they often sort of fall asleep or look very relaxed. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5558.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's those moments are kind of amazing, actually, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5562.12s)]
*  because you sort of let they really make you relaxed. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5565.76s)]
*  And then there's a few kids will be playing around. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5569.32s)]
*  So, you know, they're not interested in long grooming sessions. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5572.08s)]
*  So they're just tumbling around in the trees and things. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5575.04s)]
*  You know, and that's the majority of chimp life, actually. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5578.24s)]
*  And what's so interesting about them, because it's such a far cry [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5582.88s)]
*  and such a huge difference between the more aggressive side of chimpanzees. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5587.2s)]
*  But yeah, that's what makes them so fascinating that situation. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5593.599999999999s)]
*  They can be like that in the morning and you can feel like you've just stumbled [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5597.44s)]
*  into this sort of paradise situation. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5601.04s)]
*  Everything's so delicate and it's so. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5604.04s)]
*  Tender and and playful. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5607.28s)]
*  But then by, you know, come the afternoon, you know, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5610.76s)]
*  they've got a job to do at the border and it's completely different atmosphere. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5613.639999999999s)]
*  And it's tense and same thing. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5617.88s)]
*  Your sort of heart rate is raised. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5620.12s)]
*  And, you know, you kind of your state is determined a lot by what the chimps are doing. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5622.44s)]
*  The grooming aspect of their relationships is very unusual. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5628.84s)]
*  It's very unique and very, very fascinating to watch, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5634.48s)]
*  because, like, they they sit there and they allow each other to do this. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5638.72s)]
*  But there's also this social hierarchy aspect of it. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5643.400000000001s)]
*  And are they looking for bugs? Are they looking? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5647.12s)]
*  What are they looking for? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5649.92s)]
*  They are. Yes. So there's like a there is a real practical function. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5651.72s)]
*  And they're they're looking for ticks like [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5656.4400000000005s)]
*  all other sort of like external parasites. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5660.68s)]
*  I don't know what the other things are, but there are, you know, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5665.52s)]
*  the big hairy creatures and in the forest, things get stuck in there [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5668.76s)]
*  and ticks in particular. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5673.16s)]
*  And we, you know, we as humans going through the forest, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5675.12s)]
*  you've got to be really careful with ticks as well. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5678.84s)]
*  So, yeah, they are looking for specific things. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5682.16s)]
*  But then if you watch what they're doing and how they do it, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5685.88s)]
*  and particularly with our real sort of close up lenses, you can see in great detail, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5689.240000000001s)]
*  you know, you can see the hairs parting and exactly what they're going for. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5694.240000000001s)]
*  And I don't know, it feels like, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5698.56s)]
*  yes, that's an important part of it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5701.84s)]
*  But actually, the the purpose, they're kind of stroking each other [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5704.56s)]
*  and how long you do it for. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5709.2s)]
*  And then when you turn around and do it back, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5712.2s)]
*  all those things feel like they're much greater social value. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5716.88s)]
*  Then so, you know, there's partly a cleaning each other, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5722.4800000000005s)]
*  keeping each other healthy. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5725.56s)]
*  That's definitely important. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5726.76s)]
*  And I think, you know, they have to do it for that reason. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5728.080000000001s)]
*  But there's so many other layers to that, the relationship building and the. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5732.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5738.160000000001s)]
*  So when you're interacting with these chimps, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5740.120000000001s)]
*  is there ever a moment where the chimp tries to engage with the humans? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5742.92s)]
*  No, but, you know, there are occasionally [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5749.84s)]
*  individual, like I say, they're all individuals. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5754.280000000001s)]
*  So saying anything about the chimps do this or they don't do that. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5756.92s)]
*  You know, we're really generalizing. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5761.280000000001s)]
*  There are occasionally individual chimps who, even if they don't, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5763.8s)]
*  you know, they're not a threat to you. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5769.4800000000005s)]
*  They are showing a level of interest that is different to others. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5771.92s)]
*  And there's a chimp called Rich Burgl, the chimp, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5776.68s)]
*  who's one of who's one of our focal characters. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5780.0s)]
*  In the West. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5784.400000000001s)]
*  And he's always been very comfortable in the human [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5786.12s)]
*  because usually the chimps, like they have that a little bit of [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5792.12s)]
*  a tiny bit of residual fear of humans. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  And I think that's what makes them quite comfortable of that distance as well. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5799.84s)]
*  They're like, they're OK if you come there, but they they actually [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5804.280000000001s)]
*  don't want to be any closer. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5807.16s)]
*  They that seven to ten meter rule [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5808.96s)]
*  suits them to generally. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5812.0s)]
*  That's a comfortable distance. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5814.64s)]
*  But, you know, I don't want you that's as if the chimps like they [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5816.12s)]
*  don't really want you coming to sit next to them. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5819.36s)]
*  That's that's not OK. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5820.96s)]
*  So and I don't know whether that's just like what they like or whether [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5823.4400000000005s)]
*  they're used to it, because over the years that that is the distance [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5829.4s)]
*  that scientists have kept or whatever. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5833.2s)]
*  But you do get some chimps that decide to to come closer. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5835.72s)]
*  And yet in Rich Burgle is one of those chimps. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5841.88s)]
*  He often at a young age, very well habituated, no fear of humans whatsoever. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5846.64s)]
*  And, you know, he's never made contact. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5853.88s)]
*  But I think everybody who works with him [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5856.72s)]
*  would say, you know, he's the one that will come [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5861.84s)]
*  and sit a little closer and will walk towards you. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5865.44s)]
*  And then at the very last minute, they're off. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5869.28s)]
*  And he's just kind of curious in a way that [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5871.919999999999s)]
*  that the others aren't. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5876.4s)]
*  Now, when the chimps are on patrol, that's a uniquely intense [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5878.599999999999s)]
*  and aggressive moment, and it's so wild to watch to see them. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5884.08s)]
*  These hulking chimpanzees move through the forest in coordination. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5889.5199999999995s)]
*  When you're there with that and you're very close [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5895.5599999999995s)]
*  to these violent encounters with the other chimps, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5899.36s)]
*  is there any concern there that you could get caught up in this [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5903.24s)]
*  sort of violent frenzy and maybe be in danger of being attacked or? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5907.32s)]
*  You know, the the the reason actually, and that that I mean, the what? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5914.4s)]
*  Let me let me rephrase that. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5920.879999999999s)]
*  I would say on a personal level, of course, right? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5923.32s)]
*  You know, you come you hear about these things happening. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5925.599999999999s)]
*  You know, it's a possibility will be there when it happens and when it's filmed. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5929.32s)]
*  So we ask exactly the same question. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5933.2s)]
*  So this is, you know, I've been through the exact same process [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5935.04s)]
*  as you are now and have this conversation with the scientists like, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5938.92s)]
*  are we going to be safe? Right. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5942.36s)]
*  You know, is it safe for us to where should we be [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5943.92s)]
*  or where should we not be if this happens when we're there? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5946.679999999999s)]
*  So totally weird, exactly the same questions. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5949.8s)]
*  And we just didn't know. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5953.56s)]
*  And we were reassured by the scientists, you know, you'll you'll be amazed. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5955.360000000001s)]
*  Like, wow, you see those things, they will happen, but they will ignore you. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5959.280000000001s)]
*  And their only warning was that definitely don't get too close, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5964.0s)]
*  you know, the because the level of excitement [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5969.24s)]
*  around the chimps during these encounters, you know, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5974.16s)]
*  if there's ever a time when they could accidentally [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5977.5599999999995s)]
*  come very close to you or suddenly see you and get a bit of a fright, [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5982.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, they wouldn't want they wouldn't want to take that sort of a risk with us. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5986.24s)]
*  So they did. They did. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5991.759999999999s)]
*  We were warned, you know, keep a respectful distance from that. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5992.96s)]
*  But amazingly, and there's a little [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=5998.24s)]
*  a little behind the scenes clip that we've sort of released on on YouTube now. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6003.0s)]
*  And you can see that during [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6007.24s)]
*  during the biggest encounter that we filmed [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6011.08s)]
*  the the camera people were sort of like [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6016.92s)]
*  in it and around it and sort of at one stage sort of like [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6020.64s)]
*  accidentally between the two groups that were standing off. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6024.8s)]
*  And, you know, that the certain way I mean, the chimps move so fast [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6028.8s)]
*  and they organize, reorganize, separate or whatever. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6033.12s)]
*  So you can try and be in the perfect position, [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6035.4s)]
*  but then that perfect position could quickly become where you don't want to be [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6039.44s)]
*  because of where the chimps have gone. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6043.36s)]
*  So through no fault of their own, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6045.32s)]
*  you know, there's there are times when they're sort of they're in there sort of. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6048.88s)]
*  It's a bit like being a war reporter or something. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6053.5599999999995s)]
*  But weirdly, you know, they're so focused on what it is they're doing [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6056.839999999999s)]
*  and have no interest in sort of [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6063.8s)]
*  involving or redirecting their aggression to the humans at all. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6067.36s)]
*  I think, you know, because of. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6073.719999999999s)]
*  You know, there are some quite high profile and sort of like [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6077.679999999999s)]
*  pretty tragic sort of human chimp interactions. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6080.84s)]
*  Aren't there any in Gogo? No, no, I mean, sort of like things [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6086.2s)]
*  that have happened at zoos or yes, or whatever. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6089.6s)]
*  And I think that it I think it does give us [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6093.280000000001s)]
*  sort of an unusual impression of what chimps are like in the wild. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6097.08s)]
*  They have all that sort of capability and more so, you know, in Gogo [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6102.200000000001s)]
*  Chimps, there's so many of them and and they are engaged [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6107.08s)]
*  in these sort of violent competitions with other groups. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6111.88s)]
*  That's a very real thing. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6116.400000000001s)]
*  And and and, you know, and it can get serious. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6117.84s)]
*  But their relationship with people is just completely different [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6122.84s)]
*  to a relationship chimps might have with people in captivity [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6128.08s)]
*  or if they've been kept as pets or something. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6133.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's just it's not I totally get it. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6138.360000000001s)]
*  And those are exactly the sort of things I wanted to know before I stepped in and go. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6141.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, for sure, you need to know. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6146.4800000000005s)]
*  But amazingly, when you've been there around it. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6152.120000000001s)]
*  And even once you've just been on a single patrol with them, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6155.96s)]
*  and they are exhilarating when you go on patrol with your go go chimps, it's amazing. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6159.320000000001s)]
*  They are taking you on a on a journey to the edge of their border [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6164.4800000000005s)]
*  and they fully committed and they coordinated and [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6167.96s)]
*  and they don't seem to care that you're following. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6171.200000000001s)]
*  And they're allowing you to sort of be there. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6172.64s)]
*  That's amazing. Yeah. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6174.92s)]
*  It's a it's an incredible experience, actually. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6177.08s)]
*  It's real adrenaline. Yeah, there they are. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6179.84s)]
*  Look at that. This was my favorite part. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6181.96s)]
*  Just watching them move in coordination and just wondering like what [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6184.96s)]
*  how do they know, like what are they doing? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6188.6s)]
*  Almost seems like they're gesturing in some ways like that. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6190.72s)]
*  Chimp with the one hand. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6193.56s)]
*  So this is the behind the scenes. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6195.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6196.72s)]
*  You know, just just quite often the in our form or hands all over each other. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6197.92s)]
*  That that's undeniable. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6204.44s)]
*  They sort of reassuring. Yeah. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6206.36s)]
*  Gestures they they know that they're in this like tense situation. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6208.76s)]
*  They're nervous. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6214.0s)]
*  I think that you can read into that they're sort of telling each other [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6215.64s)]
*  that like, I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm here. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6218.88s)]
*  That physical contact is just. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6221.72s)]
*  You know, it's just reassuring each other that we're in this together. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6225.76s)]
*  It's you and me. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6231.52s)]
*  And when violence does break out, what is that experience like? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6233.2s)]
*  I mean, when you're seeing chimp on chimp violence from several feet away, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6239.36s)]
*  that has to be wild. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6245.0s)]
*  I don't like to say we I mean, I don't really want to give away [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6247.5199999999995s)]
*  any spoilers for the series because some of some of these things are sort of like [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6250.2s)]
*  major plot points in the series. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6255.24s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6257.92s)]
*  And I appreciate your artistic sentiment. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6259.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6260.96s)]
*  But it's so good. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6261.76s)]
*  It's so good that even if you say what happens and people get to see it. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6262.96s)]
*  It's so. Yeah. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6266.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, and I would say that, like I said, I often personally [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6267.360000000001s)]
*  what I wasn't there for many of the things that happened. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6271.84s)]
*  But I was some and I have been there previously and go go. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6276.52s)]
*  We're seeing things about it. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6280.76s)]
*  And it's hard. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6282.76s)]
*  I think that is. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6284.92s)]
*  Chimp on chimp violence is is a lot harder [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6287.76s)]
*  and to watch [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6292.280000000001s)]
*  I am than the chimp on monkey violence for me personally. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6295.0s)]
*  And whether I'm there myself or whether I'm seeing it recorded later on, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6299.52s)]
*  I think there's a there's kind of a sadness to that personally. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6304.16s)]
*  Quite often, it's because in truth, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6310.400000000001s)]
*  the it gets more serious if the chimps outnumber them significantly. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6314.320000000001s)]
*  So when when chimps are kind of equal sized groups, [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6320.96s)]
*  when they come into contact, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6325.52s)]
*  they're usually less violent situations. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6328.56s)]
*  There's too much danger. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6331.4400000000005s)]
*  It's there's too much danger, too much at stake. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6332.68s)]
*  It's kind of a bit bravado. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6335.400000000001s)]
*  They run at each other a few times. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6337.56s)]
*  But if there's enough chimps on either side, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6339.200000000001s)]
*  you can pretty much know that in this immediate situation, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6341.88s)]
*  no one's going to get badly hit. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6345.68s)]
*  They get badly hit when they're outnumbered. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6348.88s)]
*  And obviously that on a human level, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6351.84s)]
*  just no one likes seeing that sort of thing. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6354.96s)]
*  You know, there's there's just a. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6357.04s)]
*  Yeah, that that it's just horrible. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6360.64s)]
*  And it, you know, unfortunately, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6363.12s)]
*  we've all sort of seen that personally, or clips of that in humans. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6367.16s)]
*  And it's the most uncomfortable, horrible stuff. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6372.4800000000005s)]
*  And it really makes you horrible. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6374.76s)]
*  So, yeah, all of that stuff is very hard to watch. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6379.52s)]
*  Sorry. Well, I'll say even, you know, interestingly, [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6384.4800000000005s)]
*  I say we the scientists and go go. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6389.6s)]
*  We know them really well now, and we've worked with them for a long time. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6392.56s)]
*  So, you know, we share things and they share stories [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6396.08s)]
*  that on a more personal level with us. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6399.4800000000005s)]
*  But they are obviously better than we or a viewer would be. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6404.24s)]
*  Detaching themselves, you know, this is just what happens. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6408.68s)]
*  They're there to observe and try and understand. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6411.76s)]
*  It's not an emotional thing. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6414.88s)]
*  But even even they who have been there for many years. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6416.72s)]
*  And I think particularly because they've been there for many years, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6421.4800000000005s)]
*  sometimes you see an act of violence on a on a chimp that you've known [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6424.4800000000005s)]
*  and been following around for ages. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6428.4800000000005s)]
*  They may not care about you, but you really care about them. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6430.52s)]
*  And and it's sad. Yeah, it's very sad. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6433.72s)]
*  During the filming, well, at least on the show, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6437.6s)]
*  there's one instance of chimpanzees killing another chimp. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6440.240000000001s)]
*  Was there more of that? [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6446.0s)]
*  You're blowing all this. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6447.84s)]
*  I'm not. I'm not. OK. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6449.160000000001s)]
*  You think it's a spoiler, but I'm telling you, it's just fine. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6451.8s)]
*  It's so complex and so fascinating and so good. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6454.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I don't. OK, good. No, no, that's fine. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6458.56s)]
*  I don't know. I know it's new for me. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6461.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6465.080000000001s)]
*  Does it really matter? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6466.280000000001s)]
*  Does it? I don't know. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6467.04s)]
*  It's so good. It doesn't matter. OK. Yes. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6467.96s)]
*  OK, so that happens. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6471.080000000001s)]
*  And was it only one time while you were there? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6473.240000000001s)]
*  Well, yes, no. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6477.72s)]
*  The well, there's another thing in the series. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6480.96s)]
*  We're not going to talk about. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6485.120000000001s)]
*  OK, like, because that really is. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6486.240000000001s)]
*  A spoiler, but yes, couple of occasions. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6489.320000000001s)]
*  Whilst we were there. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6495.120000000001s)]
*  And that is how I mean, does it is it conflicted? [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6497.200000000001s)]
*  Do you almost have this like feeling that you want to intervene and protect the chimp or? [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6503.56s)]
*  I think, yeah, everybody who's been around [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6508.88s)]
*  those feelings that you wish it wouldn't happen. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6513.120000000001s)]
*  You don't want this to conclude in the way that you think it might. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6517.56s)]
*  But again, I think I totally understand [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6525.360000000001s)]
*  what why you're asking, but I think once once you've been around them enough [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6529.64s)]
*  and you and you have to have this commitment to and it's part [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6534.56s)]
*  it's part of the same point that you're asking earlier about that impact on their lives. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6539.120000000001s)]
*  You want zero impact on their lives or minimal, right? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6543.52s)]
*  You don't want any negative impact. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6548.96s)]
*  You actually can't make too much of a positive impact either. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6550.400000000001s)]
*  You know, also, it just wouldn't be practical. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6554.24s)]
*  It's not it's not safe. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6557.36s)]
*  You know, you know, what could you do? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6560.08s)]
*  Shout and make a noise and try and disturb them just enough for a moment. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6562.759999999999s)]
*  The the the chimp could get away and. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6567.24s)]
*  You know, possibly, but I think that it wouldn't be. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6571.2s)]
*  You know, it wouldn't be ethical to do it. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6577.0s)]
*  These are. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6579.44s)]
*  It is natural behavior. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6582.04s)]
*  I mean, that's my take on it from what I've seen. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6583.72s)]
*  And go, go. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6589.52s)]
*  These this is part of their natural behavior. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6590.84s)]
*  They are competitive and they're territorial. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6593.4800000000005s)]
*  And those, you know, those babies have served them well in in the past. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6597.4s)]
*  So you can't as much as it's not from a human observer point of view, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6604.92s)]
*  that same thing, taking that same situation out [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6610.8s)]
*  with something you observed in the street, all those natural sort of tendency [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6613.76s)]
*  desires to intervene and stop something, you know, they're there for good reason. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6618.68s)]
*  But, you know, this is the entire [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6624.08s)]
*  sort of the entire scientific project, our commitment as filmmakers to observe. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6628.4800000000005s)]
*  But not interfere. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6634.8s)]
*  I mean, that's that's all part of the same thing. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6635.84s)]
*  You couldn't be stepped out of that role in any circumstance. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6638.0s)]
*  You've kind of you've you've crossed a line in a really odd way. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6642.400000000001s)]
*  But so so and in a way that sort of helps with the what you're feeling [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6647.4400000000005s)]
*  when you see or observe those things, because well, you know, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6653.28s)]
*  there's absolutely nothing you can do about this. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6657.64s)]
*  Right. I mean, of course, ethically, you really can't intervene. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6659.52s)]
*  But it's still so. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6663.6s)]
*  Oh, I mean, what an amazing experience for you as a human being [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6664.92s)]
*  to have gone through this. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6670.24s)]
*  It's just such a rare, rare insight into these animals [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6671.6s)]
*  and these incredibly unique creatures and their behavior. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6676.8s)]
*  It's just you must feel so fortunate just to have to experience just [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6679.64s)]
*  as a human being, just as a life experience to take that in. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6684.04s)]
*  I really do. Yeah, I really do. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6687.88s)]
*  I mean, this, you know, I've been very lucky in lots of [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6691.04s)]
*  bits of my job that I've done over the years. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6695.92s)]
*  I think that it's a great job. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6698.12s)]
*  It's very hard work, a lot harder than probably what people appreciate. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6700.12s)]
*  And but extremely lucky on on loads of things. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6703.68s)]
*  I do feel with the Ngogo chimps in particular, like you say, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6708.88s)]
*  as a human being, from an existential sort of point of view, there's like. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6712.6s)]
*  So I'm so fortunate and not really, [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6719.12s)]
*  not many people get to see that, and they are our closest relatives [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6723.08s)]
*  and they are. Fascinating because of the connections we have with them, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6728.24s)]
*  they're also fascinating because they're different and they're all individuals. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6733.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's a chance to just you kind of feel a part of something [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6737.2s)]
*  that has, you know, brought that [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6742.04s)]
*  important knowledge and information to people. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6746.6s)]
*  Yeah, so I feel personally very fortunate. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6751.4800000000005s)]
*  How do you top that? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6754.360000000001s)]
*  Are you always trying to top your work? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6760.68s)]
*  I mean, what you've done is so extraordinary. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6763.360000000001s)]
*  I watched it and at the end of it, I was like, how do you beat that? [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6765.52s)]
*  You know, I mean, you are always I mean, you are always trying to make something [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6769.280000000001s)]
*  better than you did before on a personal and professional level. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6774.08s)]
*  You want. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6777.68s)]
*  You know, you want to do really cool stuff that people like. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6779.24s)]
*  And so, yeah, I'm always thinking about [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6782.28s)]
*  what what what could be, you know, what could move things on. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6788.28s)]
*  I think [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6793.52s)]
*  making a series about the Ngogo chimps is quite hard because they feel [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6796.400000000001s)]
*  they aren't for all the reason we just said they are our closest relatives. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6801.0s)]
*  They are the biggest group [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6804.879999999999s)]
*  in terms of sort of story and character, which I think is probably, [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6808.04s)]
*  you know, I mean, you're you're a chimp and you love like all bits of it. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6813.28s)]
*  And you're you're fascinated and on levels that a lot of people [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6818.28s)]
*  maybe don't appreciate. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6821.799999999999s)]
*  So I think you you get the whole whole thing. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6823.4s)]
*  But I think what [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6827.64s)]
*  potentially what the broader audience is sort of, you know, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6830.12s)]
*  really responding to is is the characters and the stories. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6833.2s)]
*  You know, there are the real chimpanzee characters that you can follow [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6836.96s)]
*  through the whole series. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6841.36s)]
*  And and that is hard, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6843.48s)]
*  certainly harder to do with other animal species. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6847.08s)]
*  You know, there's so much going on there in terms of individual variation. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6851.44s)]
*  And, you know, chimps, psychology, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6856.68s)]
*  you know, you're always just wondering, what are they thinking? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6860.0s)]
*  What are they going to do? What's he making of that? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6863.04s)]
*  What does she want now? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6865.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, they invite that level of intrigue, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6867.24s)]
*  not depth and a depth of character, the genuinely [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6870.96s)]
*  different characters who all kind of want quite different things. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6875.84s)]
*  And that as a sort of storyteller in the natural world is quite a unique [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6880.0s)]
*  opportunity. So. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6885.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, actually. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6888.68s)]
*  I'll just rest for a while. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6890.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you have another project lined up? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6893.96s)]
*  I mean, we finished working on Chimpanzee quite a long time ago. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6896.5599999999995s)]
*  So it's been over about a year or something. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6900.639999999999s)]
*  We finished the edit. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6904.68s)]
*  So I'm working on other stuff already. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6906.44s)]
*  I can't I can't. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6911.44s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6912.68s)]
*  I would imagine if I was Netflix, if I was one of the CEOs, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6913.92s)]
*  I would be in immediate conversation with you about season two. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6917.64s)]
*  I think I think you're very wise. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6922.0s)]
*  And I mean, I think we have we have talked about it [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6924.08s)]
*  with the the commissioner, Sarah Edelson, who, you know, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6928.88s)]
*  she loves the series and was behind it from day one. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6933.36s)]
*  Shout out to Sarah. Yeah. Shout out, Sarah. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6937.36s)]
*  And she we've we've talked about it. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6940.56s)]
*  We talked about it even before we started, actually, because I think, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6944.64s)]
*  you know, she could see the potential, actually, that, you know, [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6947.76s)]
*  this isn't a this is a, you know, it's a window of time into the Ngo Ngo group. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6952.400000000001s)]
*  But they don't stop having interesting stories just because we stop filming them. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6957.96s)]
*  So we sort of knew there was that potential. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6961.76s)]
*  And there is a kind of a conversation that's sort of bubbling [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6964.4400000000005s)]
*  away. But I think waiting, I think it is the sensible thing to wait, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6969.360000000001s)]
*  let this series, you know, have its impact, whatever that will be. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6975.4800000000005s)]
*  I like that I personally love love to do it. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6982.12s)]
*  And I think the whole team would be like, we can't stop now. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6985.52s)]
*  You know, can we? Because it's still happening. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6989.04s)]
*  Ngo Ngo, that's OK. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6991.72s)]
*  This the story for the series is finished, but the Ngo Ngo story continues. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6993.240000000001s)]
*  And we've learned so much and all that. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=6997.76s)]
*  At the same time, there is an argument for saying, you know, it feels quite definitive. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7000.24s)]
*  And, you know, people would worry about [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7005.76s)]
*  what we don't want to do is just rehash the same sort of narratives. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7009.56s)]
*  Well, it wouldn't be the same thing because all the chimps get older [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7014.96s)]
*  and new characters want different things. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7017.8s)]
*  And, you know, that story happened in that time. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7020.36s)]
*  So everything that happened there won't happen again. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7024.32s)]
*  But still, there's some, you know, the experience of watching season one [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7027.28s)]
*  is is it's partly you're following that story, [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7032.92s)]
*  but you're also being introduced to the Ngo Ngo chimps. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7035.599999999999s)]
*  And like, you know, you're learning about what they do [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7038.5599999999995s)]
*  and how they do it, how they relate to each other. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7042.719999999999s)]
*  So there's a lot of that experience, which [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7046.639999999999s)]
*  if you did a season two, you in a way, it would be great [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7050.64s)]
*  because you would jump straight into the story [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7054.4800000000005s)]
*  and not have to have as much exposition about the groups. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7058.08s)]
*  But yeah, don't know. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7062.200000000001s)]
*  Do you think it should be another one? Yes. OK. Yeah. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7064.92s)]
*  Without doubt, I would watch it. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7067.08s)]
*  The is when an alpha controls the group. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7068.8s)]
*  How long generally is there rain? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7074.56s)]
*  And what happens to them when they get pushed out? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7078.24s)]
*  So that's interestingly, that's different in different [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7082.96s)]
*  chimp groups across Africa. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7087.2s)]
*  But at Ngo Ngo, I think like six, seven years [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7089.2s)]
*  is the average like good tenure. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7094.16s)]
*  There have been chimps who have taken the alpha position, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7097.839999999999s)]
*  but have not done it very well and have been out after a year. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7101.2s)]
*  There's one chimp there, Bartok, who was in charge for 10 years, [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7105.4800000000005s)]
*  but he was very, very successful alpha and very politically astute. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7111.24s)]
*  So I think the average at Ngo Ngo is six or seven years. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7117.44s)]
*  Yeah, and that's quite a long time. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7125.04s)]
*  It's fascinating because it's similar to presidential reins. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7125.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7130.04s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It is interesting. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7132.88s)]
*  I wonder, you know, it's like the peak of their prime and their control. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7135.76s)]
*  It's like they have a term limit. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7141.8s)]
*  It is interesting because regardless of age as well. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7144.12s)]
*  So it doesn't really feel like, yeah, there isn't there isn't like at Ngo Ngo. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7148.56s)]
*  There's there's an average sort of expectancy of alpha ship. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7153.04s)]
*  And I think that's, yeah, six or seven years. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7157.72s)]
*  And that's why we knew that Jackson, the start of [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7160.56s)]
*  when we were filming, we knew that he was entering a period [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7165.04s)]
*  where things could get tricky for him because he'd been in charge for about six years. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7167.96s)]
*  And it is very interesting that that tends to be the term. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7175.52s)]
*  And the longer the study goes on for, the more interesting those things become. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7178.88s)]
*  Because I think in the early days, when they were first observing the chimps, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7183.4800000000005s)]
*  they were like, OK, well, he was in charge for three years. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7187.200000000001s)]
*  He was in charge for seven. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7189.76s)]
*  And, you know, there didn't seem to be any pattern. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7191.04s)]
*  So it was all sort of, well, you're just at the top until someone knocks you off. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7193.2s)]
*  But it does seem interesting that they don't see them lasting that much longer. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7198.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, they expect them not not to stay there for much longer. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7204.360000000001s)]
*  Is there any evidence that they learn from the chimps that are successful [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7208.52s)]
*  and they mimic this sort of political behavior and sort of like social awareness? [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7213.8s)]
*  Of keeping everybody happy and sort of like governing and, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7219.96s)]
*  you know, in a sort of an effective sort of harmonious way? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7224.72s)]
*  Well, whether they see other chimps, yes, doing well through that. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7231.56s)]
*  I don't know. I think that's a. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7238.12s)]
*  I think that's a good question. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7241.04s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that, actually. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7244.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, there's certainly there's leaders in. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7246.24s)]
*  They adopt different strategies individually [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7250.32s)]
*  and definitely the ones that that are better [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7253.88s)]
*  managing their political relationships and their allies. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7259.28s)]
*  They they stay in power longer and they have an easier time of it. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7263.28s)]
*  Like Bartok. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7266.88s)]
*  And I mean, these are chimps that passed long before this series, but you would be [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7268.5599999999995s)]
*  interested in it. Bartok is a small guy. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7274.44s)]
*  I mean, always looked big when he was Alpha, because they tend to sort of [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7278.919999999999s)]
*  they just hold themselves differently. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7282.48s)]
*  So they puff their hair out. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7284.759999999999s)]
*  It's called pylorect when they stick all that their hair goes on. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7286.28s)]
*  And it literally gives them a different silhouette, a different body shape. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7289.679999999999s)]
*  And so when you are Alpha, you tend to look bigger anyway. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7293.48s)]
*  But even when he was like that, he didn't look as big as the other chimps. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7297.28s)]
*  He was a relatively small chimp. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7300.24s)]
*  But he was the longest serving Alpha they've ever had in Gogo. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7303.08s)]
*  So he was the most successful leader there. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7307.4s)]
*  And it was right at a time when Ngo Gho was still one massive group. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7309.88s)]
*  So he probably was leader at the time when the group was biggest [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7314.719999999999s)]
*  for the longest period. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7320.16s)]
*  And he was also the smallest guy they've ever had in charge. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7321.96s)]
*  Hmm. And they put all that down to he was extremely good [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7325.0s)]
*  at keeping his relationships going with all the other big males. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7330.88s)]
*  So all the big guys that could threaten him, he was grooming them all the time, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7334.599999999999s)]
*  keeping them happy. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7338.68s)]
*  Wow. And what happens to them when they get overthrown? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7340.12s)]
*  Do they just assume a lesser position? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7345.08s)]
*  They do. I mean, they they [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7349.16s)]
*  act and go, go. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7352.28s)]
*  They they tend to everything is OK after that. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7353.5599999999995s)]
*  Like they they might get beaten up badly in the overthrow. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7357.48s)]
*  They might get a bit injured there, but it's they've know [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7363.04s)]
*  it's never been lethal and go go. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7366.599999999999s)]
*  Whereas at other sites, I've heard the Alphas have been killed. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7369.12s)]
*  You know, they've been they've been killed in in the transfer of power. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7374.16s)]
*  That's never interesting. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7378.4s)]
*  That's never happened in Gogo. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7379.679999999999s)]
*  They you know, the incoming [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7382.04s)]
*  there could well be a big fight and some minor injuries. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7385.96s)]
*  But then that's it. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7390.0s)]
*  And there's a there's a new dominance hierarchy established. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7391.4s)]
*  And as long as the outgoing Alpha [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7396.44s)]
*  is submitting to the incoming one and in the formal way, the Pantgrunt [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7400.84s)]
*  whenever he comes by, then that's just OK. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7407.88s)]
*  We've sorted this out. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7410.36s)]
*  We now know like he's on top. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7412.44s)]
*  And the other chimps know. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7415.36s)]
*  And but what happens then is they they they can sometimes retain [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7417.12s)]
*  a sort of high position in the hierarchy, like Miles, for instance, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7422.88s)]
*  who's Jackson's giant friend. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7427.4s)]
*  He was Alpha for quite a brief period. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7430.6s)]
*  And then I can't remember who was after. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7434.04s)]
*  And then I think could have been Jackson. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7436.64s)]
*  Actually, you took it off. Miles, Miles remained high up there [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7438.6s)]
*  in number two and number three spot. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7443.8s)]
*  He's always remained powerful. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7445.64s)]
*  But some of them, you know, Bartok, I think just after he left [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7448.12s)]
*  the Alpha position, he just began the trajectory down the hierarchy [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7452.6s)]
*  and just retired. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7457.84s)]
*  He was out of it. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7459.72s)]
*  So they're not competing anymore. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7461.04s)]
*  I'm all done. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7463.92s)]
*  They just accept a new position. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7465.12s)]
*  Yeah. And they just they really drop down all the way down the hierarchy. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7466.6s)]
*  They're no longer competing in the higher levels of the dominance hierarchy. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7470.92s)]
*  They retire from that. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7475.12s)]
*  Are you aware of Robert Sapolsky's work with baboons? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7476.88s)]
*  No. Sapolsky spent a lot of time embedded with baboons. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7481.4800000000005s)]
*  And one of the things that he observed that's incredibly unusual is [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7486.72s)]
*  there was a group of baboons that was eating food that was in garbage [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7490.16s)]
*  that was from I believe it was a resort. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7495.32s)]
*  And these particularly ruthless Alphas [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7498.24s)]
*  who would have first access to all this kind of food, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7502.04s)]
*  they got poisoned because they ate this bad food and they wound up dying. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7505.28s)]
*  And it completely changed the way they behave with each other. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7509.88s)]
*  The ruthless Alphas died. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7514.96s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it became this sort of utopian civilization [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7517.24s)]
*  amongst baboons where they didn't exhibit any of that barbaric behavior. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7521.6s)]
*  And they were much more kind to each other. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7525.52s)]
*  That I didn't know that is fascinating. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7528.4800000000005s)]
*  And that just shows that the outsized impact [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7530.72s)]
*  some individuals can have on on the overall sort of culture of a group. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7534.6s)]
*  Right. Much like humans. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7541.28s)]
*  And I think the same thing has happened at Ngogo and lots of different levels. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7543.56s)]
*  Like the the the central group ran by Jackson. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7550.4s)]
*  There's a lot of competition. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7555.24s)]
*  There's there's not as much play. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7557.5599999999995s)]
*  It's all quite quite harsh existence. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7561.4s)]
*  And then the Western group, who are much smaller [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7565.88s)]
*  in number, they spend much more time playing and socializing. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7569.5599999999995s)]
*  And and the females in that group have a have a nicer time. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7576.24s)]
*  They get beaten up a lot less often. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7581.24s)]
*  And that doesn't sound like a very nice thing as a positive. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7582.92s)]
*  Oh, and the females don't get beaten up as much. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7586.24s)]
*  Like, that's a good thing. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7588.04s)]
*  Unfortunately, in chimpanzee society, that just does. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7589.28s)]
*  You know, and it's not just I mean, chimps beat each other up. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7592.0s)]
*  It's a bit of life and the females get [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7595.2s)]
*  and get a part of that as well. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7598.84s)]
*  But interestingly, females seem to to love being in in the West. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7601.68s)]
*  And there's quite a lot of incoming feelings into the Western group. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7607.4400000000005s)]
*  Incoming incoming females into the Western group. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7612.4s)]
*  So they've got a small number of males, but a huge number of females. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7616.599999999999s)]
*  And females have left the central group and gone to the West. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7621.04s)]
*  And they play a lot. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7626.36s)]
*  Now, how did they make transitions from one to the other? [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7628.2s)]
*  Like if there's a the West group, like how does another chimpanzee [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7632.36s)]
*  become embedded in that group? [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7637.68s)]
*  Well, it only it couldn't as a male chimpanzee. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7640.36s)]
*  You can't do that. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7643.08s)]
*  No, they're just any male chimpanzee sort of [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7644.679999999999s)]
*  going over to the other side would just be met with extreme hostility. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7649.32s)]
*  And females, it's part of the sort of natural cycle. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7655.36s)]
*  The when females reach sexual maturity, [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7660.36s)]
*  they they leave the group where they were born. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7666.12s)]
*  And it's to, you know, lots of animals do that. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7669.0s)]
*  Actually, it's encouraged genetic diversity. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7672.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. So same. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7674.240000000001s)]
*  You know, you see that in quite a lot of different animal species. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7676.8s)]
*  And they do that, you know, 10, 11, whatever, maybe a few years later. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7682.4800000000005s)]
*  But at some point around that period, they will make that make that change. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7688.160000000001s)]
*  And they arrive at a completely different group. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7694.360000000001s)]
*  They travel across the forest and they sort of hang around on the edges [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7697.8s)]
*  of that new group and just gradually get accepted in. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7702.240000000001s)]
*  But, you know, chimpanzee communities accept [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7705.64s)]
*  females arriving from other groups. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7709.6s)]
*  Do other females challenge that? [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7712.400000000001s)]
*  They do. They they generally get a very hard time [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7715.04s)]
*  when they first come to the group, actually, partly because the [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7718.52s)]
*  the males were all very interested. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7722.360000000001s)]
*  And, you know, this is it's a purely positive thing for the [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7724.48s)]
*  for a new female to arrive at the group. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7728.799999999999s)]
*  But the the females that are there already [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7732.24s)]
*  will often be quite hostile to that new female for quite a long period of time. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7735.799999999999s)]
*  It's I think, you know, during the during our series, our filming period, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7742.0s)]
*  one of the females that we knew well [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7747.839999999999s)]
*  left the group where [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7750.5599999999995s)]
*  where she was. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7755.24s)]
*  And you sort of you worry about them [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7756.48s)]
*  because it's inevitable that they're going from a place [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7760.92s)]
*  where they know everybody and they're treated relatively well. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7764.879999999999s)]
*  And, you know, it's their their sort of family and social group. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7769.12s)]
*  And then they're traveling across to a group where everybody is sort of [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7775.08s)]
*  hostile, but the local females in particular. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7780.5199999999995s)]
*  And that might last a while as well. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7784.56s)]
*  So for the first couple of years, even, it could be. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7787.6s)]
*  Yeah, it could be, you know, quite a nervous, anxious existence. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7791.32s)]
*  You're very. But yet they're compelled to do it. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7796.2s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7799.16s)]
*  Now, when they do this, do they ever go back and forth? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7802.36s)]
*  Not that I know of, no. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7807.16s)]
*  So they quit that group, they join another group, and that's where they stay. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7808.96s)]
*  Yes. Wow. Yeah. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7813.56s)]
*  As far as I know. Yeah. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7816.08s)]
*  That's it. That's the new life. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7818.52s)]
*  The new group. But the interesting thing now in GoGo, because there's the [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7821.8s)]
*  the former giant and GoGo group is now central group and Western group. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7825.72s)]
*  So in a way, this is going to make transferring as a as an adolescent female [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7830.8s)]
*  a much easier thing to do because they're going to be trying. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7837.28s)]
*  Some of them will transfer from central group to the Western group, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7841.12s)]
*  where they know everybody, actually, because until a few years ago, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7845.36s)]
*  they were part of the same group. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7849.0s)]
*  So that that's different to before. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7851.16s)]
*  So when the females from the central group go to the Western group, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7856.28s)]
*  they know people already or they know, excuse me, they know chimpanzees already. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7859.5599999999995s)]
*  They'll know some of them. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7862.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's been a it's been a few years. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7864.12s)]
*  How many? It was 2018. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7868.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, fair. When when when they finally really split. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7871.12s)]
*  And what was the cause of the split? [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7875.44s)]
*  So, I mean, a number of different things that kind of go back quite a few years. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7878.48s)]
*  I mean, the sheer size of the group, you know, never been documented anywhere. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7885.84s)]
*  The NgoGo, the numbers of chimpanzees in the original NgoGo group [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7892.0s)]
*  are more than twice the size of the next biggest group. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7897.679999999999s)]
*  So it was a bit of a mystery how they were holding together anyway, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7901.919999999999s)]
*  and also whether they would hold together forever. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7907.4s)]
*  Can they really just keep on growing and maintaining, [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7910.16s)]
*  staying as one group, bearing in mind, there's still the same sort of social structure. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7915.08s)]
*  So you still have a single alpha male, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7920.4s)]
*  but the group is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7924.08s)]
*  Even back when I was there a few in like 2015 previously. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7929.08s)]
*  So this was before they split. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7934.84s)]
*  But at that point, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7936.759999999999s)]
*  remember Kevin Langergrave, one of the the scientists that was there at the time. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7939.719999999999s)]
*  And he was explaining that actually the NgoGo community is a bit different. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7946.4800000000005s)]
*  Like they are one group, but they have these little subgroups, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7952.8s)]
*  like neighborhoods within the territory. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7957.280000000001s)]
*  And so they're already describing some of these neighborhoods as the Easterners [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7961.8s)]
*  and the Westerners and stuff. They were part of the same group. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7966.84s)]
*  And the males would, you know, patrol the territory together. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7970.120000000001s)]
*  So they're on the same team, but they hung out in different areas. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7974.16s)]
*  And it was quite, you know, they'd really have an association with that area [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7978.88s)]
*  that was much stronger. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7985.24s)]
*  And they did think that was the beginning of sort of, OK, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7986.72s)]
*  we're spending less time with them. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7989.639999999999s)]
*  When we see them, we'll groom and it'll be fine. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7993.08s)]
*  But we're gradually spending less time with each other. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7995.599999999999s)]
*  And that was sort of the beginning, I think, of these sort of divisions. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=7999.76s)]
*  And then, I don't know, big, big fights, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8005.0s)]
*  particularly between Jackson and the other, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8011.5599999999995s)]
*  the what became the leading Western males. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8015.32s)]
*  Yeah, big, big, big fights there. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8021.16s)]
*  The thing contributed to this sort of growing divide. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8024.24s)]
*  And then there just came a point in 2018 [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8029.96s)]
*  where the scientists were saying, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8033.52s)]
*  you know what, they're the only they're properly separate groups. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8037.4s)]
*  Now, this is it. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8040.88s)]
*  You know, do any of the females from the Western group [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8043.24s)]
*  go to the central group when they reach sexual maturity? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8046.36s)]
*  I don't think that's happened yet. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8052.04s)]
*  No, but I think they will expect. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8055.04s)]
*  I mean, this is all this is all new because 2018. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8057.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, this is the whole thing about this series, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8061.240000000001s)]
*  which I feel like, you know, asking you felt lucky. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8065.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm very lucky to spend time with the Ngo Ngo Chimps. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8069.08s)]
*  But at this period is is fascinating [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8071.52s)]
*  because, you know, brilliant for filming and the potential [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8075.56s)]
*  for interesting story to unfold was was right there from the start. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8079.88s)]
*  But it's also it's scientifically it's unknown territory. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8083.92s)]
*  And and the you know, we worked with them. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8088.96s)]
*  I keep name checking people with sorts of reminding me [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8095.56s)]
*  the different roles that they sort of played. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8097.76s)]
*  John Matani, who's one of the the main scientists there. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8100.32s)]
*  He was really the one who sort of highlighted when this happened, [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8105.36s)]
*  sort of how how unique this was going to be. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8110.2s)]
*  And I remember thinking, oh, this is amazing. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8113.96s)]
*  God, what this new thing has happened in GoGo. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8117.24s)]
*  But he was saying, well, look, it of course it is fast. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8121.0s)]
*  It's a fascinating thing to happen. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8125.12s)]
*  But now we have two groups [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8127.04s)]
*  that are both completely habituated to human presence and their rivals. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8130.28s)]
*  And so as scientists, we can be there and study [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8136.12s)]
*  what happens between these two groups and as filmmakers, too. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8141.2s)]
*  You have access to this sort of being on this [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8145.48s)]
*  the two different sides of this chimpanzee rivalry [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8149.0s)]
*  and with equal access. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8153.36s)]
*  Now, that never happened before, because usually chimpanzee groups, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8155.36s)]
*  the habituated group, the ones that scientists have got used to human presence. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8162.2s)]
*  You can study them and film them very closely. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8166.4s)]
*  But the wild chimps, the truly wild, not used to people ones, [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8170.2s)]
*  you can't get close to them as a scientist or as a filmmaker. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8174.12s)]
*  You know, they're out there. You can hear them. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8176.8s)]
*  But you can't get close to them. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8179.36s)]
*  So the split presented this fascinating situation [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8180.96s)]
*  scientifically, but also this really unique filming opportunity. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8187.0s)]
*  We can literally be embedded in these two different groups. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8191.04s)]
*  And and nobody knows what's going to happen over the next year or two. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8196.119999999999s)]
*  And but but we know it's going to be interesting. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8201.64s)]
*  And we know there's sort of there's a new situation here that. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8204.88s)]
*  The. Yeah, anything could happen. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8210.56s)]
*  That sounds like a pitch for season two to me. It does. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8213.32s)]
*  Because there's so much that could happen. Yeah. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8220.36s)]
*  The Rears and honestly, yeah, it is. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8223.92s)]
*  It does sound like a pitch for season two. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8226.52s)]
*  It is fascinating what's happening there at the minute. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8228.84s)]
*  You would find it. Personally, fascinating. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8232.52s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure I do. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8236.04s)]
*  I mean, just watching it, I find it personally fascinating. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8238.04s)]
*  Listen, I just think you did a fantastic job and should be very proud of it. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8241.960000000001s)]
*  And it's as a person who is very fortunate enough to be alive [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8245.6s)]
*  when this is airing on Netflix, it's it's it's really groundbreaking stuff. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8250.960000000001s)]
*  And I mean, until I understood until I knew the I mean, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8255.240000000002s)]
*  we kind of watched some of the behind the scenes footage, but I had no idea [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8259.28s)]
*  how long it took to get these chimps accustomed to the scientists [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8264.240000000002s)]
*  and the camera people being there. It's just so unique. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8268.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's you can't underestimate that. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8273.16s)]
*  I know it sounds like I'm sort of trying to check credit with them for it, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8276.68s)]
*  but you just you cannot underestimate how valuable that is. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8281.6s)]
*  Like that's true of almost any. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8286.36s)]
*  Well, I'd say vast majority of cool things you see captured on film [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8290.36s)]
*  with with animals is OK, the film crew did a great job. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8295.2s)]
*  But usually that was because there were years and years and years [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8300.16s)]
*  of sort of scientific work beforehand that even just enabled you [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8304.84s)]
*  to get in a position where you could see it, but also to understand it [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8309.32s)]
*  and what was happening. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8313.32s)]
*  And it and it's so you feel it with the Ngo Ngo chimps. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8314.8s)]
*  We just felt it from the beginning. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8318.08s)]
*  You feel it every day, like all the things that that you're wondering about, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8319.64s)]
*  things that amazed me at the start, like those are possible [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8324.52s)]
*  because of a like decades of work and decades of tracking [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8328.44s)]
*  and following these chimpanzees in the most responsible way as well. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8334.16s)]
*  So this this what would be a sort of fragile relationship [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8340.48s)]
*  between humans are closest relatives, all the things that's amazing about it [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8344.36s)]
*  because of what they did over over the decades there. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8348.16s)]
*  And and everything that we knew about every one of those chimps, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8352.76s)]
*  we were able to study their back before we even went out. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8357.32s)]
*  We could study their backstories, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8360.52s)]
*  like for over 200 chimps, detailed information about every [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8362.64s)]
*  chimp when they were born, who their relationships with, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8366.599999999999s)]
*  certain events in their lives, any trauma that they'd had, [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8369.84s)]
*  who they liked, who they didn't like. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8373.439999999999s)]
*  We got a proper sense of who each individual chimp was. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8375.199999999999s)]
*  And all that, you know, that's just that's all the scientists providing that. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8379.76s)]
*  So. Yeah, I'm not just giving them a shout because I feel like they just [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8384.96s)]
*  it's just if you're actually interested in understanding how that works, like that, [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8391.08s)]
*  we slid in on the back of that. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8396.359999999999s)]
*  That that is how this sort of project works [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8398.64s)]
*  with the with the access to the chimpanzees. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8403.16s)]
*  But it's actually it's the access to the scientific project [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8405.32s)]
*  and the Ugandan field track as you do it. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8409.4s)]
*  And they've just, you know, they've done it for 30 years. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8411.88s)]
*  And then, you know, fortunately, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8416.32s)]
*  they said to us something really interesting happening [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8419.52s)]
*  and they supported us doing it. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8423.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, so fortunate and so unique. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8426.16s)]
*  And I remember the first time [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8430.16s)]
*  seeing the very first episode just blown away. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8433.36s)]
*  Like, how how did they do this? How did they get so close? [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8437.28s)]
*  I mean, it's like, are they using drones? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8440.800000000001s)]
*  I was like, do they have camera traps everywhere? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8442.76s)]
*  Like, how are they doing this? [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8445.36s)]
*  It's just so incredible and [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8446.720000000001s)]
*  so fascinating, so unique. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8450.960000000001s)]
*  And congratulations. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8452.68s)]
*  That that means a lot. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8454.2s)]

*  I don't really know. I'm not big on social media. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8481.48s)]

*  Don't do that. Don't do that. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8492.52s)]

*  But there's, I mean, there is actually, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8503.52s)]
*  like the Ngogo Chimpanzee Project have a Facebook page. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8506.960000000001s)]

*  They kind of they get the things that the people from the public [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8516.080000000002s)]
*  will be interested in. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_kTGMYbHiA&t=8521.6s)]
