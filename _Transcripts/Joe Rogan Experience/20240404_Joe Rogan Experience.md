# JRE MMA Show #154 with Matt Serra, Din Thomas & John Rallo
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4T-AJ1alag)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Okay. I'm ready when you are. Okay.
*  I'm thinking about popping this thing.
*  Yeah, you gotta roll, man. We gotta get it going.
*  I feel like we've been over... Yeah, we missed the joy that it's Matt Serra.
*  We need a name for this order of unruly gentlemen.
*  We need a name for us.
*  I wanna think about it. This is Matt's first Zin, by the way.
*  And it's a six milligram. That's a heavy dose.
*  But I'm not a... I'm a caffeine guy.
*  That's a lot like caffeine, but even more.
*  Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I seen it at 7-eleven. I know Tucker Carlson takes it.
*  He loves them.
*  He got so excited that I had one, he's like, why do you have them too?
*  I'm gonna shove them into that seat.
*  It's not a dip, though.
*  No.
*  It's just a little pouch. It's not actual tobacco.
*  It's just the nicotine chemical.
*  Nicotine is a chemical that is neuroprotective.
*  It shows... There's been studies that have done that it shows some sort of a connection with helping ward off Alzheimer's, I believe.
*  I'm not sure if that's true. I might have made that up.
*  Nicotine? I might have made that up.
*  You said it's good for you. Cat Williams, we are strong.
*  Yes. Nicotine as a chemical is not bad for you.
*  What's bad for you is the delivery system of cigarettes.
*  Particularly cigarettes if you buy cigarettes with chemicals in them.
*  So there's those American spirits?
*  Yeah, what are they called? American something.
*  Spirits?
*  That's like a marketing. I don't think that's true.
*  They have shit in them too?
*  Of course, they're cigarettes.
*  But I think it's different.
*  I thought they were just supposed to be paper and tobacco.
*  Oh, those liars.
*  Okay, nicotine for Alzheimer's disease.
*  There's no evidence from randomized controlled trials to support the use of nicotine as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
*  So what was the thing that... Wasn't there something about a connection between the way nicotine works and some sort of... There's something I read.
*  My thing is, if I start with the nicotine...
*  Go back to that please, Jamie.
*  It says, while nicotine itself doesn't cause dementia, the act of smoking cigarettes may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia as you age.
*  The harmful substances in cigarette smokes can lead to inflammation factors linked to the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
*  I know that nicotine is a medication they use sometimes for heart patients.
*  So find out what that is. Fuck that is.
*  My thing is the cigarette...
*  Probably a brassio dilator.
*  Did you ever see that movie with Russell Crowe, the insider?
*  Yes. No.
*  He's about the dude who works for the cigarette companies. He's a chemist.
*  And he's talking about all the shit they throw in the cigarettes to make them super hyper addictive.
*  So it's actually not the nicotine that makes it addictive?
*  Well, nicotine is addictive as well.
*  Right.
*  Nicotine is addictive as well.
*  That's my question.
*  And then they just super juice it up according to this movie.
*  Before you get me addicted to these things, if I put this in my mouth...
*  Well, you're going to be scratching my fucking Tyrone building.
*  If I start... If I start it...
*  Hey man, Sarah, I do nicotine.
*  If I'm an everyday... What is this called again?
*  Zin.
*  If I'm an everyday Zin guy, if I stop it, am I going to be like...
*  No, I stopped it the other day for two days. I said, I want to see what it's like.
*  And?
*  Nothing.
*  Well, did you wait three days? What about four days?
*  I didn't have an itch. No.
*  I would think you would have got it earlier instead of later.
*  I like them.
*  Are you an everyday Ziner?
*  Yeah, not every day. I take days off.
*  I take days off. But the thing is, I don't know if that's my biology.
*  I can just do things and stop doing them.
*  I can't.
*  There's a reason why I never tried fucking cocaine or anything.
*  I haven't either.
*  I had these two pizzeria bosses, and one of them, just last week,
*  had to get a new spine, and now he's on a ventilator.
*  I don't want to get emotional now, but anyway.
*  I think he might be dead by now, but it's very depressing.
*  But anyway, I was 17 years old, and I used to deliver pizzas for these guys,
*  Nicky and Louie, and they were funny.
*  They remind me a little bit of a Joey D. ass. They were just smoking cigarettes.
*  They were very funny. But they told me, they go, if you try it once.
*  They used to have a cocaine problem, but they cleaned up.
*  And he goes, Matt, you try it once, and you're fucked.
*  And I wait. Sold. And I got scared. I got fucking scared.
*  I'm scared.
*  And I knew that. And I've been in situations, obviously,
*  where it's like, talk about pure pressure, man.
*  I was like, fuck it. You know, you've got to be that guy.
*  I got real lucky when I was growing up, that I had friends that liked it,
*  that were good friends, and told me to never do it.
*  And then I also had a friend whose cousin sold it.
*  And when he sold it, he went from being this regular dude to being like a vampire.
*  And he just stayed in the attic. He had an attic apartment with his girlfriend,
*  and they just did coke and watched movies and sold coke.
*  And he lost a ton of weight. He started getting real gaunt and skinny looking.
*  And I was like, yo, it's like they got bit by a vampire.
*  God!
*  It's like they got bit by a vampire. It's like you're not the same person again.
*  Now your whole mission in life is getting coke.
*  That's your whole mission. Everything else is out the window.
*  All that success and love and family and friendship and dinners with friends.
*  Fuck all that. You've got to get coke.
*  Yeah, that's not the way it lives.
*  You just throw this thing in your mouth like that.
*  I just stick it between my cheek and my gum.
*  That's it.
*  Amen.
*  But you know what else I found that I really like is these.
*  I should kind of not be talking about this because these motherfuckers took the name
*  that we use for our nootropic, which is awful great.
*  But these are like a nootropic pouch.
*  So this doesn't have any nicotine in it. It's a bunch of nootropics,
*  which I really like nootropics.
*  Maybe they didn't steal our name, but it's kind of close.
*  I'm kind of confused about it.
*  I think that all the time.
*  Alpha Brain was one of the first ones.
*  The first one that I ever found out was Neuro One.
*  Remember that guy Romanowski?
*  Yeah, Romanowski, who was a football player, obviously got a lot of head impacts
*  and he was having problems with his memory, so he devised a supplement.
*  It's really good. That was the first one I ever found out about.
*  And I'm sorry, what did you say is in that again?
*  This one? It's got a bunch of different nootropics.
*  What's the word you just said?
*  Nootropics.
*  No, not for the people at home. Not me.
*  Exactly. What exactly is a nootropic?
*  It's the building block for human neurochemistry.
*  So it's things like acetylcholine.
*  There's a bunch of different ones.
*  Show the ingredients for Alpha Brain, if you could.
*  There's lutein. There's a bunch of different things that have been shown
*  to increase cognitive performance.
*  So we actually did randomized controlled trials at the Boston Center for Memory for Alpha Brain.
*  We sponsored two of them.
*  And it showed an increase in verbal memory, your ability to retain words,
*  which I really find.
*  Like I take it every time I do a UFC, I take Alpha Brain.
*  Always. It helps my memory.
*  I'm talking about fights from...
*  And you'd be bringing up Zingers.
*  Yeah, you'd be bringing up Zingers that everybody forgot about.
*  I've got some Pete Spratt information for you.
*  But it does help.
*  Okay, so Alpha GPC,
*  Hyperzia, Vitamin B6.
*  Theanine is a really good one, too.
*  Theanine is also in another thing I really like, which is neuro gum.
*  I actually use that.
*  I have these right here, Neuro Mints. I like these.
*  Not a sponsor, just good product.
*  Vitamin B6, obviously good for you.
*  So all these things, what it's shown is, if you take these things,
*  it's just like we know that there's certain nutrients that your body needs.
*  We know we need Vitamin D.
*  And if you're not getting it from the sun, you can supplement it.
*  There's a bunch of different things you can supplement.
*  But you can supplement the things that your brain needs to work at the best level.
*  Speaking of mints, the amount of supplements I take, you would go crazy.
*  Oh, I would not.
*  Morning stuff, fucking night stuff.
*  If there was one dude in this room that I would come to, who's got the supplements?
*  John Rolo knows about some supplements.
*  What is that, some Jocko Mulk? What are you on?
*  What kind of protein do you take?
*  I do have some Jocko's Mulk at the house.
*  Oh, bro, I buy that shit by the case.
*  I have the new one, Sweet Cream.
*  Have you tried Mark Bell's stuff?
*  Yeah, Mark Bell's stuff. Great. The steak shake. That's great.
*  I love that shit. That's what I've been hitting lately.
*  But what I like about the Jockos is they're already made. I'm lazy.
*  I got to run out the door. I got two of those bitches. I got 60 grams of protein. Bam.
*  So you don't get the pre-made ones. You got to make them.
*  No, I get the powder. And the main reason too is because I like to put it in my oatmeal too.
*  So I'll mix it up like that.
*  Well, I'm not a goat so I don't be eating oatmeal.
*  Like a fucking goat. I'm eating bacon and eggs. What are you eating?
*  I'm fucking back on. I'm back to being gluten-free now.
*  Isn't it funny that when people show up, people used to eat oatmeal if they were starving.
*  Those were people that were like poor people that were just starving to death working in the fields.
*  And now we're like, oh, granola.
*  Eat some bacon, you fucking idiot. Get some eggs. Just eat a dozen eggs and some bacon.
*  I hope you don't think I miss many meals.
*  No, you ain't missing any meals.
*  Do you mind if I grab some coffee?
*  Get in there. What's for you?
*  I seen a, since the last time we spoke, remember the last time we talked about my ass not to get into that fucking...
*  Remember we talked about, hey, what's that right here?
*  For the folks at home.
*  A refresher.
*  I don't want to leave everybody on a cliffhanger.
*  The last we spoke, I was supposed to take a shit in a box to go to the lab.
*  Right.
*  And I had, I had, it was, I don't know what it was. I just never did it.
*  And then I finally was like, you know what? Fuck it. I'm doing it.
*  And then I changed insurance. I had to get a different doctor. So I had to, anyway, I seen a holistic doctor, right?
*  So I ended up doing it.
*  Like a witch doctor?
*  Dude, now listen, I was a little nervous too.
*  What is a holistic doctor?
*  Should I be?
*  Is that a real thing? Is that a real thing?
*  Well, listen, I'm going to find out. Thank you, brother. It's Mike G. from Huntington, right?
*  Somebody recommended him. I know what you're thinking. I was thinking the same thing. It's going to be, do you have any sweetness?
*  We don't.
*  Nah, I'm a, let me pre-Madonna.
*  Do we have any out there?
*  No, no, I don't want to be that guy. Jamie, sit down, please.
*  We got a guy. What do you want?
*  Splenda?
*  Yes, Splenda. Stevia.
*  He's like, I don't want to be that guy. Splenda, Stevia.
*  You haven't had that mint cream.
*  Jamie, sit down. No, Stevia.
*  Listen, first of all, it's hard to get a, it's hard to get an appointment with a lot of these fucking doctors, you know?
*  Especially the holistic ones.
*  They're all doing voodoo.
*  That wasn't his arm.
*  They're out at last ceremonies.
*  No. My wife started by trying to book these doctors and couldn't get it. So then somebody recommended this guy.
*  All right. So I was expecting a fucking half a hippie sipping wheatgrass. I didn't know what to expect.
*  It was a guy who looked like John Rollo, 59, strong guy, nice guy.
*  He was telling me that, you know, a lot of these, they just want to put you on meds.
*  They don't look at what caused the problem or that they just want to treat. They want to treat the problem.
*  They want to treat the problem. They don't want. He's like, I want to turn back time with you and shit like that.
*  I don't listen to nice guy like a share song like a share song.
*  She was pretty. She was pretty, but she had no ass.
*  She should not have to have an ass back then.
*  She snuck in under the wire.
*  Yeah, she's still kind of hot. I'd smash back in the day.
*  It's gorgeous. I'm not.
*  Now she was pretty.
*  She looks pretty good today. That's what I'm saying.
*  That's really right now.
*  The sunny animal, the sunny and the sun.
*  Now she was hot.
*  That's wild that he went on. What did he became a senator?
*  I think it was the mayor of his whatever city he was in Clint Eastwood became the mayor of Carmel, California.
*  I remember that Sonny Bono was like a senator.
*  Wasn't it? Wasn't he?
*  Jimmy shit was a congressman.
*  He got in politics, but like heavy duty into politics and then he died skiing.
*  He's a motherfucker.
*  Now, Kennedy died to the.
*  Yeah, one of the Kennedy's guys same way in like real close proximity to a nice to love skiing.
*  16th mayor of Palm Springs, California from 88 to 92 and served as the U.S.
*  Representative for California's 44th district from from 1995 till his death.
*  And he was both.
*  He was the mayor too.
*  Let me ask you.
*  Let me ask you.
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  How much is a Republican?
*  I got you, babe. The hippie movement, right?
*  With the fucking Bell.
*  I know what my thing is this from Ronald Reagan, the Sonny Bono.
*  Do people like the policies or they just like in the fucking guy?
*  I was just watching Idiocracy the other day.
*  Oh, my Lord.
*  That is the film.
*  Oh, wait, hold on.
*  That's fucking great.
*  Great.
*  So good.
*  He's like, you like the white.
*  What about what he's saying?
*  Yeah, he's seeing the council.
*  He's like, yeah, my first wife, my first wife was taught it.
*  She's a pilot now.
*  No, that movie is fucking great.
*  It's a great movie, man.
*  It's not exactly politically correct, but it's fucking.
*  It's not at all, but it holds up.
*  You almost couldn't make it.
*  You can't make any of the Tropic Thunder.
*  Tropic Thunder would be impossible today.
*  I got to watch that again.
*  Impossible today.
*  I haven't watched that in ages.
*  Bro.
*  Great movie.
*  That's a great movie.
*  Great movie.
*  That's a great movie.
*  And Robert Downey Jr., not only was he in blackface, but he was in yellow face.
*  Memory came out talking to them about catching Jack Black in the rice patties and shit.
*  It was hilarious.
*  Easy there, Shane Gillis.
*  I think they're going to be marching on ground control.
*  Listen, man.
*  Asian people take it better than anybody.
*  You know who I know?
*  Emojis.
*  Emojis are all yellow and there's no complaint.
*  I know.
*  No one is.
*  Not a single complaint.
*  Not a single complaint.
*  You're right.
*  Not a single complaint.
*  You're right.
*  Asian people just keep working.
*  That's true.
*  They never have a problem.
*  That's what they say.
*  There was legit Asian hate though after COVID came out.
*  There was a lot of really dumb people that were just running up to Asian people hitting
*  them.
*  Yeah.
*  I see that a lot.
*  Especially in New York, a lot of the subways.
*  Crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's where they need people to step up.
*  But that's real.
*  That was like violence.
*  That wasn't just talking.
*  It wasn't just yellow face.
*  You can get away with yellow face.
*  Nobody fucking does shit.
*  You can do it.
*  You can do it.
*  You can do it.
*  You can do it.
*  You can dress up like a bumblebee.
*  Nobody will freak out.
*  Like when they got that kid, there was a kid who turned out to actually be Native American
*  who had half of his face.
*  Oh, the chiefs game.
*  So brilliant.
*  Yeah.
*  So he had half of it.
*  He had literally put on like war paint of, I think of the tribe that he's from.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  I think it's from the tribe that he's from.
*  And one of those websites tried to label it as a fan, a racist fan in blackness.
*  So the only show this side of his face where it was dark and the other side of his face
*  was white, which was like this war paint.
*  Oh, no.
*  And the kid turned out to be Indian as well.
*  Oh, no.
*  So they got the double.
*  They were wrong twice.
*  People are just so quick to jump the gun.
*  I'm sick of this woke shit.
*  Let me tell you.
*  Let me tell you loud and clear.
*  I am sick of what they did to fucking Star Wars.
*  They took the shit all over it.
*  Marvel.
*  I love everybody.
*  You know, I love everybody.
*  And I'm a I'm a like I have three daughters.
*  I love strong, like female characters.
*  Vassquez from fucking Aliens.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, she was a bad guy.
*  Weaver.
*  Alien.
*  Hamilton.
*  I'll go.
*  Terminator.
*  No, there's nothing.
*  How about this?
*  There's nothing wrong with making everybody badass.
*  Now, I'm basically the wrong guys.
*  You guys see Ahsoka?
*  I did.
*  What's Ahsoka?
*  My brother.
*  Yeah, it's a Disney plus show.
*  It's about a Jedi.
*  There she is.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, Rosario Dawson.
*  Yeah, she's hot.
*  Now, it's not to get too geeky on you on you, but listen, it's too late for that.
*  I got to go.
*  This is the deal with Ahsoka.
*  It's not it's based basically off of another show, which was an animated show.
*  Not to get too nerdy on you.
*  First of all, before you pick on me, George St. Pierre watches these same fucking shows.
*  I talked to George about this.
*  We geek the fuck.
*  I go, George, how do we have a fight?
*  He's like he's telling he's he knows more than me about all this shit.
*  He reads the books.
*  But anyway, the show was a cool show.
*  The show Rebels, right?
*  And it's about this young Jedi Ezra, Ezra, right?
*  So now they're doing a lot.
*  I guess I stay with me for two seconds.
*  So now the live action comes out, right?
*  And Ezra at the end of the series, Ezra fights this guy Thrawn and he goes through another
*  dimension and he leaves a fucking hero.
*  And now he's in it.
*  Now the next appearance is him live action in this series years later.
*  They make him the biggest cuck in the universe, right?
*  This guy was a fucking Jedi badass in the cartoon.
*  They have a I'll give you a couple instances, right?
*  They get they find them there on the planet.
*  His friend finds him.
*  I forgot her name, but she she gives him a fucking she's like a Mandalorian.
*  She gives his lightsaber.
*  Do your thing.
*  Now, look, they can't make him look too cool because he's a dude.
*  They go, hey, he goes, listen, I don't need the lightsaber.
*  The force is my weapon.
*  So already, boo, right?
*  They're big, boo.
*  Really?
*  He's the lightsaber.
*  They surround it right now.
*  So he's he's like doing some fucking hippie shit.
*  It's whatever.
*  Next, this gets me.
*  Now you'll relate, Dean, you'll relate to this.
*  I'm with you.
*  Now there you have two of these.
*  He's been on this planet.
*  They find them on.
*  They have two of these horses, these alien horses.
*  It's Ahsoka, the Mandalorian chick and Ezra.
*  So there's three of them riding.
*  On a motorcycle when there's two guys riding.
*  Now the guy in the back, it's called riding bitch.
*  Who's riding bitch?
*  Ezra.
*  Now is that just because it just happens to be?
*  No.
*  It's like that on purpose.
*  I get it.
*  Am I going with it?
*  I mean, I blame it on the Z.
*  Here's the thing.
*  I can't wait to see.
*  You can have both.
*  Here's the thing.
*  You can have both.
*  You could have a strong woman character and a strong man
*  character.
*  Conan the Barbarian could be riding on the back of a horse
*  with a chick at the reins and no one would question shit.
*  Right.
*  Well, unless that's fucking, wait hold on.
*  He thinks she's so badass.
*  But imagine, he thinks she's so badass he lets her.
*  Yeah, red Soja.
*  There you go.
*  But isn't that who he was banging?
*  He's got to be, exactly.
*  He's got to be humping the chick to get on the back.
*  Yeah, hold on.
*  I disagree.
*  I don't think he's riding bitch.
*  Me either.
*  Me either.
*  Me either.
*  As I was saying it, I was like, I can't defend this bitch.
*  You went too deep, too fast.
*  I went too far.
*  Yeah, you didn't take that out all the way.
*  This is fucking-
*  I think the Barbarian we're talking about.
*  Maybe John Wick on the back of a motorcycle killing people
*  while his girl drives.
*  Possibly.
*  You wouldn't say John Wick's a pussy.
*  Well, you know.
*  He's a very polite guy.
*  He's undeniable.
*  He cannot be a cuck.
*  There's a big fucking-
*  But this guy was-
*  But the guy that he's talking about surely was.
*  I didn't even think he was a badass in the show.
*  What?
*  But he was a badass in the cartoon.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's like-
*  Wait a minute.
*  But it's all with who wrote it, though.
*  I-
*  Here's the thing.
*  It's not really Star Wars.
*  It's just this new thing that they're using.
*  It's Disney.
*  The Star Wars universe.
*  In Star Wars, it's Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.
*  And that's it.
*  It's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
*  It's C-3PO.
*  Everything else, you're just stealing my money.
*  That's the truth.
*  The days-
*  That's pretty much what I think.
*  Listen, right now, Han Solo would be toxic.
*  Han Solo was the fucking PIMP.
*  How about when Han Solo's about to go with the fucking carbonite?
*  As a kid watching this, as a kid, it's emotional.
*  He's getting lowered into the fucking carbonite.
*  You don't know if he's going to survive this thing.
*  Chewie's sitting there upset.
*  Fucking Lando's being a bit of a-
*  We're unsure about Lando.
*  And Leia-
*  Wait a minute.
*  No, I love Lando.
*  He's a badass.
*  But Leia goes to him, I love you.
*  What the fuck does he say back?
*  Watch this.
*  What does he say back?
*  Could you play it or no?
*  Watch this.
*  He says, I know.
*  Right?
*  Spoilers, Rogan.
*  Watch this.
*  Watch this.
*  Look at that, first of all, yeah.
*  Watch this.
*  I love you.
*  I know.
*  Yes!
*  Gangster.
*  That's my fucking Star Wars.
*  He doesn't know if he's going to live.
*  He doesn't, and he does love Rita.
*  He's the fucking man.
*  I love Han Solo.
*  Hey, Ezra, take notes.
*  Matt Serra, former UFC welterweight champion,
*  is also a nerd.
*  Oh, I am the biggest nerd I know.
*  Full on, 100%.
*  Full on nerd.
*  First, can I thank you now?
*  Because listen, this show doesn't come without perks.
*  Listen.
*  I was only geeking about the VR last time.
*  So all of a sudden, I love that POP 1, I still do.
*  I was just playing it before I got here.
*  And another guy got in touch with me from Caveman Studios,
*  this guy Lonnie, he goes,
*  look, I love how enthusiastic you are.
*  Try this game in beta testing.
*  So it's not even out yet.
*  It's coming out at the end of the month.
*  Contractors showdown.
*  Fucking money!
*  I don't play anything but POP 1.
*  Am I getting off the subject?
*  We're just talking about MMA.
*  No, we're talking about him.
*  We got the MMA.
*  There's no subject.
*  Listen, holy shit.
*  It's like, war zone.
*  It's like Call of Duty war zone.
*  I love the battle royale format, where it's like a squad,
*  and then everybody gets brought in together,
*  and you gotta take each other out.
*  That's cool.
*  Let's POP 1.
*  Technically, it's Fortnite, not to sound like a nerd.
*  This shit!
*  Contractors showdown!
*  Fucking nerdgasm.
*  I love it.
*  It's so much fun.
*  Is that a new word?
*  Guys, you're parachuting in on people?
*  This is the deal.
*  You parachute out.
*  Now when you go, you loot up, right?
*  You get money.
*  You get shit.
*  You wrap your hands?
*  What the fuck?
*  Well, he must have had some damage.
*  He had to heal up a little bit.
*  So then you get guns.
*  So you're fixing to go to war.
*  You got money.
*  Yeah, you get your boys, and then you're like,
*  look, I don't know about that nerd, but look.
*  We're here.
*  Now look, all right, now that you see the perimeter.
*  Dude, everybody gets brought in.
*  You get scopes.
*  You put it on.
*  You get money.
*  You could buy stuff, put it on.
*  And you're taking these guys out.
*  You're sniping them.
*  And this is all in virtual reality.
*  It's in virtual reality.
*  It's fucking cool, dude.
*  That guy likes it.
*  You should get a new job reviewing VR games.
*  That's not a bad idea, actually.
*  It's so much fun.
*  Imagine if you had a YouTube channel.
*  I love watching him review a game.
*  That's actually a great idea.
*  He wouldn't do it though.
*  But get a YouTube channel.
*  Just video him playing the game.
*  Just get someone to do it.
*  That's a fun game.
*  You should get the USC to do that.
*  Do you still do the thing with Jimmy?
*  Yeah, man.
*  Jimmy, me and Jimmy, twice a week.
*  UFC unfiltered.
*  Why don't you?
*  Fuck, what?
*  I'm playing it.
*  Why are you guys laughing at that?
*  Why don't you get the UFC to just film you doing that too,
*  as well?
*  Dane, are you listening, motherfucker?
*  That's a great idea.
*  Dude, it's a no miss.
*  You'd be fucking awesome at that.
*  You really love these things.
*  Your character.
*  He's so passionate.
*  Look how enthusiastic he is about it anyway.
*  Yeah, you should 100% be reviewing games.
*  It's so funny because that could be very sad normally
*  when a 50 year old's fucking.
*  I'm going to be 50 this year.
*  Last time I was on here, they did a thing called
*  My Dad is a Gamer and it had me on air fucking being sick.
*  My daughter's watched.
*  My daughter watched.
*  But no, I love that shit.
*  It's fun.
*  It's fun.
*  It's harmless.
*  It's fun.
*  Since I've known you, you've been on it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's harmless if you can control it.
*  But they're so fun, you'll wind up wasting your whole life.
*  Well, that's why my thing is it's like getting everything's
*  about balance, like like passing the guard.
*  You know, I I I feel like I deserve it at the end of the day.
*  If I go, I do a 7 a.m. class.
*  I fucking do my podcast.
*  I go back. I'm rolling with my wife.
*  I had a full day.
*  You know what? I deserve two hours or an hour.
*  A couple of games, three hours.
*  Yeah, no, you definitely do.
*  But you're a disciplined man.
*  Well, it's fun.
*  But you're a disciplined man.
*  Most people don't have that type of discipline.
*  Yeah, you're but you're an accomplished martial artist.
*  You're you run a business.
*  You have a family.
*  You're you're a disciplined man.
*  If you're just a fucking dorky kid.
*  Oh, no. Yeah.
*  You know, I get it.
*  Who just has a job.
*  You know, you just clear from that job.
*  And that's all you fucking do.
*  It's the same thing with the reefer.
*  Like if you're a guy doing stuff every day and you're smoking,
*  that it could help.
*  Yeah. But if you're like in that commercial one, hold on.
*  They're blowing the shit out the window.
*  Hey, Ma, I the guy's going to call me back.
*  I left a message for the job.
*  That's a problem.
*  Like, you know, if you're 30 years old, you're living at home.
*  You're fucking.
*  But, you know, everything in is how you use it.
*  Yeah. Back to what is that?
*  Star Wars mod for contractors and women.
*  You know, listen, you got to be a woman.
*  There is.
*  What is it?
*  He's got to be a woman character because the women always win.
*  Yeah. Contractors is a is a game that it's all been out forever.
*  I don't know. I'm not really into it.
*  But the contractors showdown is coming out at the end of the month.
*  And it's fun. That's the battle royale version.
*  The nerd. I guess my wife hears me talking about this online.
*  And she's like, you fucking have no idea.
*  You know, she loves me. But it's fucking it could be a turn off, I'm sure.
*  Yeah, I don't think it's a mod.
*  It's not a panty.
*  I'm sure it's not.
*  That's not it. It's not the ultimate panty dropper.
*  I was trying to make me.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what?
*  You know what?
*  Fuck it is.
*  Hold on.
*  Oh, look at that.
*  Look at the app.
*  Fuck it. Don't fuck.
*  No, no, it's not the gluten free.
*  Yeah. I think this thing's making me crazy.
*  It's making you crazy.
*  It's it's hyping you up.
*  That's great. It's good.
*  But it's good.
*  I'm going to give you another one in five minutes.
*  No, don't do that.
*  The problem is this.
*  The problem is this.
*  I start the day.
*  Me and him went out to eat last night.
*  We went to the Brazilian joint.
*  And I didn't eat since because I got to clear out
*  because I got to you know, I got issues, you know.
*  So I woke up and I had the water
*  and I had a double shot of espresso.
*  And I don't want to be and I was a little down last night
*  because I had too much of whatever edible.
*  Okay. So I was a little like,
*  I hope I'm not like this tomorrow.
*  So I had a five hour energy.
*  Yeah. And now I had that in the coffee.
*  So this is what you get.
*  It's on. It's on.
*  It's on.
*  I'm having fun.
*  You were talking about making you were talking about
*  coming up with a name for us.
*  Yeah, we need a name. Yeah, we need a we need a name.
*  A cool Star Wars name.
*  Nerd guys.
*  We just call it Cucks.
*  Yeah.
*  No one can say shit about us.
*  That's not bad. Cucks.
*  That's actually kind of funny.
*  I was going to say like the OGs, but that's too serious.
*  That's too serious. Cucks.
*  Cucks might actually work.
*  I like Cucks.
*  It's not bad.
*  It is ridiculous.
*  Yeah. You know, you want to be Cucks.
*  I kind of like I don't want to be a Cuck.
*  I think I'm kind of enjoying that.
*  Cucks is not bad.
*  I'm a placeholder.
*  It put aside a bookmark on it.
*  Come back to it later in the day.
*  See how we feel in an hour.
*  Should we take a poll?
*  What is your what is your.
*  You don't want to let the people be involved.
*  They're going to hijack that shit.
*  And we're going to be Cucks for sure.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  I'm 100 percent.
*  That will not be a fair vote.
*  They would try to get us.
*  Johnny, you had one first.
*  You were like the four horsemen.
*  Oh, Jesus, that was a long time ago.
*  I have a weird memory.
*  I remember weird shit.
*  Because I remember I remember I'm the furthest thing from a horseman.
*  I'm not exactly a fucking dog.
*  You need help getting a horse.
*  I don't know.
*  Know what the problem is?
*  You'll be on a stallion and me and Joe will be on like ponies and shit.
*  I'll be on a mule, a mini horse.
*  I'll be on a sturdy mule.
*  I was watching a mule
*  biting a fucking hyena.
*  Oh, they use them to bite wolves.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You think a hyena would have a fucking.
*  Me. Yeah, they're fucking mean.
*  They're smart.
*  Yeah, yeah. Mules.
*  Yeah, they'll use them to like protect the herd and shit.
*  What? For real.
*  Mules are so much smarter than horses.
*  Like people like them when they travel through the mountains,
*  because a mule won't go anywhere where it's not safe.
*  A mule will go, uh, bitch.
*  We're not no better.
*  Yeah, I'm no better. I'm not going over there.
*  That edge is too steep.
*  Well, we're falling.
*  And so I mean, it's just like
*  horses just go right off the edge, man.
*  They just listen.
*  You got to not stand behind those motherfuckers, though.
*  Horses? No, I got a mule.
*  Either one horse kick you.
*  Oh, my God. I watched a horse kill another horse.
*  No. Yeah.
*  And a video online.
*  That's what I'm talking about.
*  That's crazy.
*  I'll spit up my coffee. That's a donkey.
*  Oh, what did I say?
*  They don't fuck around.
*  A mule. A mule is a cross.
*  What's the difference?
*  A mule is a cross between a horse and a donkey.
*  And they're they're not viable.
*  Yeah, but wouldn't you think that the hyena would fuck this thing up?
*  Yeah. Yeah, you would think so.
*  But it looks like that hyena is fucking tranquilized
*  because they're videotaping this.
*  Yeah, maybe it does look like they're playing.
*  That doesn't seem very playful.
*  I mean, that seems pretty violent on the.
*  On the donkey's part.
*  Hawaii playing, but he's not.
*  I don't know, man.
*  I don't think they play like that.
*  I think it recognizes.
*  I think it recognizes that's a predator and it wants it to fuck away from it.
*  Yeah, that's what I think it is, man.
*  And that thing's trying to bite it like what is going on here?
*  It's a it's a three or four minutes.
*  But it's some gay shit.
*  I know, right?
*  This sniffing asshole.
*  Maybe they are friends.
*  Maybe I'm out of line.
*  Maybe they're friends.
*  Maybe the hyena and the donkey will get along, but probably not.
*  They're fucking predator and prey animals.
*  Yeah.
*  But if they kick you, man.
*  So there was a video of these
*  beautiful horses, man, and they're in this corral.
*  And this one horse just starts kicking and he just kicks the other horse in the head
*  and the head and it dies.
*  Like it dies right then and it dies like you got shot, like, wow.
*  That's crazy. Falls down, legs stiff.
*  Oh, yeah. All I do.
*  Killed it.
*  This time I'm in the fucking bathroom, like an hour to clip in the middle of the night.
*  All I do is watch those fucking animals on animals.
*  Fucking nature.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I just somehow get into the videos.
*  I'm either watching like the world's the hip hop fights.
*  I watch that more than regular fights.
*  I don't know why.
*  Because they're more fun.
*  I saw one today.
*  I don't think we could play it.
*  It's probably violates rules.
*  But this dude is on the ground and he's basically like fighting.
*  This guy's got a helmet on.
*  It looks like there was some sort of a traffic altercation.
*  And the guy who's on the ground has a dude.
*  He's like setting up a heel hook and the guy's trying to attack him.
*  And then the other guy comes over and punches him and then they separate them.
*  And when they separate him, the dude who's on the ground is like holding the guy
*  like he's going to set up a heel hook, pulls a gun out and shoots him in the dick.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yes. Just like this.
*  Boom. Shoots him in the dick.
*  Oh, what the fuck, bro?
*  It's rough. Want to watch it?
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  100 percent, right?
*  There's some things you can't unsee.
*  Yeah, but you never ask.
*  Yeah, but you got to see this.
*  It's so funny.
*  You got to see it because I had to watch it because it's it's an Instagram reel.
*  I had to watch it a couple of times.
*  Just to try to figure out what exactly was going on.
*  I always like to see what's going on out there.
*  You know, I always like to.
*  Is it this video, Joe?
*  No, no. Hold on a second.
*  Good. Get a score with some other shit, Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  Was this chick up there last time?
*  Or am I fucking crazy?
*  Yeah, she's always on.
*  OK, I said, OK, this is the horse.
*  Watch this. Oh, no.
*  So this horse, it just kicks.
*  Oh, damn.
*  Yep. Dead. Look at his legs.
*  Good Lord. It died.
*  Look at his legs.
*  Oh, wow. Yep.
*  Bro, you get hit by one of those, you might as well get shot.
*  That's a hoof at the end of a chain.
*  Oh, man.
*  You know what?
*  OK, now show the guy getting shot in the dick.
*  Now, what did you ever try?
*  Did you ever try horse meat?
*  But yes. Is it good?
*  It tastes like wild game.
*  I tried it in Montreal.
*  This is amazing restaurant in Montreal called Joe Beef.
*  And me and Duncan and Ari ate there and they served you.
*  They had a horse tartare.
*  So it's essentially raw horse.
*  And then they had like a horse fillet.
*  They served this horse fillet.
*  I was like, wow, this is weird.
*  You know, he used to eat horse meat.
*  Patrick Coté, remember, was in the house.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  We used to get a list of what we could put on there, what we wanted.
*  And he put horse meat on his list and we were like, what the fuck?
*  Smart. Yeah.
*  Nobody would fuck with it.
*  That's all those dudes up north in Canada.
*  You know, I almost don't want to see this.
*  Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do. So watch this.
*  Why are you saying that?
*  So this guy, this got to be Brazil.
*  I don't know. But look, see, the other guy comes over, kicks him.
*  They push him away. Now watch this.
*  Keep an eye on the guy in the bottom.
*  He's got a gun. Yeah. Watch here.
*  Come on.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Fuck. Yeah.
*  Why is he still fighting?
*  No, no, it's not a real play.
*  Whoa. Whoa.
*  I mean, whoa. He's a eunuch.
*  Whoa. Jesus.
*  And the best is it looks like they're doing a little all right.
*  They might be blue belt level.
*  I was about to say, yeah, that's definitely Brazil.
*  That guy's got a stripe or two on his butt.
*  I don't think that could be just.
*  Oh, bro.
*  Come on, man. Bro, bro, bro.
*  Keep that shit between you and Tom Segura.
*  I don't need to see that shit.
*  I don't want to be part of that fucking test.
*  That shit hurt me. It hurt me just to watch it.
*  Fuck. Oh, no.
*  You got to wonder what other damage that did.
*  Oh, that's it does. It's over.
*  Oh, the damage. You got lost his dick, Raul.
*  What do you mean? What damage you thinking about?
*  I think he lost everything. He lost a lot.
*  That bullet probably blew his fucking
*  smite into his organs.
*  You got to you got to really try to avoid everything in this.
*  Everything. Everything.
*  What I always tell Dean Thomas, the troublemaker.
*  What? I always got to stop him.
*  Dean does mellow me out.
*  Yeah, I got to stop him every time we do a show.
*  He gets it almost gets in a fight.
*  We all prefer to.
*  First of all, not true.
*  But second of all, we we did.
*  Everything come out yet, but we did that fucking cold plunge
*  on that fucking show.
*  Let me ask you something about the degrees of that,
*  because I'm thinking about adding this into my routine.
*  The cold ones. I swear, man, because I start my day with esteem.
*  I'm thinking about putting it a little a small one in my locker room upstairs
*  and my thing. But it was fucking brutal is what it was when we did it.
*  It was 32 degrees. Thirty four.
*  OK, I'm trying to make it. Yeah.
*  I think it was thirty four.
*  Thirty three minutes. Is that is that pussy shit?
*  No, that's normal.
*  Yeah, that's what I do every day.
*  No, thirty four.
*  Three minutes every day.
*  I was fucking doing my work.
*  But did you? All right.
*  Let me next question is, did you build up to that? Yes.
*  Well, all right.
*  And every two days, two days, two days, a bit of that third day.
*  I did 20 minutes. Stop.
*  No, I did. I filmed it at thirty four at thirty four degrees.
*  Yeah. I want to see how long you go.
*  That's pretty crazy. Well,
*  but somebody watch all you know is nobody's watching.
*  We handled it differently.
*  Yeah, we sure did.
*  He was quiet.
*  And then once in a while, you hear like a Goggins come out of him.
*  Like, I can handle this.
*  And I'm like, I'm carrying the boats and all that shit.
*  And I'm fucking.
*  I just wouldn't shut the fuck up.
*  He wouldn't shut the fuck.
*  I was I was thinking to myself, well, he shut the fuck up.
*  I can't concentrate.
*  I had to keep myself.
*  I want to jump the fuck out.
*  And Dana was right there.
*  And did he? He did it.
*  How long?
*  He does it every day.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  I'm pretty sure he told me he does it at like 50 degrees.
*  Yeah. All right.
*  What the fuck is it OK to do it?
*  It's 50 degrees. Yeah, it's OK.
*  OK. Yeah. Look, it's still cold.
*  Stay in your line.
*  I don't think it has the same amount of an effect, probably.
*  But I'm just guessing it might be the same thing.
*  If you did like 50 degrees for like five minutes, maybe that's that's the same
*  as like 34 degrees for three minutes or two minutes.
*  I don't know. I don't know.
*  Then I'll do that.
*  You know, I kind of like I like the part where I don't want to do it.
*  And then I do it.
*  I like that.
*  You do it in the morning.
*  First, like, how do you do that in the morning?
*  Like, that's the last thing that I want to do when I wake up.
*  Probably the best time. Exactly.
*  That's why you do it.
*  They do it. It's easy.
*  It's an easy win. It's an easy win.
*  Imagine if all day, if all day you were thinking about, oh, I got to do it.
*  I got to get it in and get it done.
*  It's also you know, you don't want to do it.
*  And yet you did it.
*  So it's an easy win.
*  Well, I felt like that when I after we finished.
*  So I bought one, but I purposely didn't put it together.
*  So just just so I didn't have to do it.
*  Just so I had to look at that moment and make myself look like a bitch.
*  I think it's an easy thing to add to my morning routine,
*  because I have a nice routine as it is.
*  I start like 7 a.m.
*  I do that class. I get up at five.
*  I get there early. I get my head straight and I get in the steam.
*  That nice steam after that.
*  So so I don't you know, I like getting my head straight,
*  but I don't like smelling bad.
*  So I like this like afterwards.
*  I'm just I'm in this I'm zen mode, man.
*  And I'm caffeineed up.
*  Now you're in zen mode.
*  I see what you did there.
*  I like that. I might get into that shit.
*  I like it as long as I'm not fucking craving
*  like marbles if I get off the shit.
*  I'm not going to want to fucking want nicotine.
*  Am I or need it?
*  Well, just don't get it.
*  But don't get more of it.
*  I'm saying if I stop this in, am I going to want more of it?
*  Well, I don't know how your body works,
*  but a lot of people get addicted to it.
*  Well, thanks for turning me on to it, you fucking crack.
*  Thank you.
*  It's good for you.
*  Is it good for you?
*  I think it's good for your brain.
*  Then there you go. I'm on it. Yeah.
*  But I think, you know, you got to be careful if you're one of those guys.
*  Well, I mean, how many of them do you take a day?
*  Yeah, talk to me, Jamie.
*  Look, I can't even prevent the formation
*  in the test tube of protein clumps, like to all.
*  There is. OK, this is the thing.
*  So nicotine prevents the formation in the test tube of protein clumps
*  linked to Alzheimer's disease.
*  Scientists announced at a press conference today,
*  the finding may provide a useful starting point for developing drugs
*  that delay or prevent the disease.
*  Research is quick to caution, however, that harmful effects of smoking
*  strengthened by report in science last week, linked in a carcinogen
*  byproduct of cigarette smoke to a specific kind of lung tumor
*  far outweigh any possible benefit from nicotine and tobacco.
*  So but what they're saying is don't smoke.
*  But they're not to see itself.
*  Yeah, I think nicotine itself.
*  Nicotine definitely is a nootropic, right?
*  Like if you can Google that.
*  So it's a substance that's been shown to enhance cognitive function.
*  So one of the things that like Stephen King said when he stopped smoking
*  is that was one of the hardest things for his writing.
*  So there's like a synapses didn't fire as fast.
*  Oh, what does this say?
*  Nicotine's cognitive effects have gained significant attention
*  in recent decades, and some non-smokers have even started using nicotine,
*  gum or patches as a nootropic.
*  Research has shown that nicotine can speed up reaction time,
*  improve working memory and enhance focus and attention.
*  What? Dude, yeah, you got me.
*  I know. Watch me in VR now.
*  I'm going to kill everybody.
*  That's nice, man. Interesting, right? Interesting.
*  Yeah, man, as long as it's
*  I'm I think I'm interested in the alpha brain. That's great.
*  Yeah, I'm interested in anything that gives you like a positive effect.
*  Yeah, like, man.
*  Well, also, what about dick pills?
*  Anything that has a positive effect on your life, you know?
*  It's fun to party.
*  Yeah, I actually take the alpha brain all the time.
*  Then I ran out and forgot.
*  Oh, we'll get you some.
*  We'll get you some. I'll get some sent to you.
*  But like all those other ones are really good, too.
*  That neuro one shit, that stuff's great.
*  Put it in a protein shake or you could just drink by itself.
*  Tastes good. There's a bunch of them.
*  How many of the things would you do a day like one?
*  I it takes me a few days to go through one packet.
*  I don't know how many is in a packet.
*  Oh, so would you take more than one a day?
*  Yeah, I'll take one, two, three a day.
*  Really? A day if I feel like it. Yeah.
*  And you feel a difference.
*  Yeah, but I do like to know that I could take days off.
*  I take days off. I'm like, how I feel. I feel fine.
*  You do feel fine. I feel weird.
*  Do you use it before like a podcast or before before?
*  So, yeah, for the like during podcasts.
*  So you see, it has to have a purpose.
*  This is also the same reason why I drink coffee a lot.
*  Trying to keep my brain going if I'm talking to really smart people.
*  I was happy when I saw that guy and he was telling me what I should
*  because I got my side.
*  Took that. I took the shit.
*  Oh, yeah, the shit in the box.
*  Yeah, stop that story.
*  Oh, sorry. I get back to the shit.
*  So after I saw the guy and he gave me the sample, I go,
*  all right, listen, I'm going to knock this thing out.
*  It took me a while. It was months before I did it.
*  But then I find now real quick, does the shit in the box
*  go to a doctor or to know they come and they come and pick it up
*  and then they go to a lab and it's for a doctor.
*  Doctor. Why?
*  Oh, he gets the results from it.
*  We wanted to find out what's the definition of holistic.
*  Oh, yeah. The problem might be in just that people have co-opted that term.
*  And use that term holistic for a bunch of hippie shit.
*  But a holistic doctor, I'm telling you,
*  he could be a holistic approach.
*  What is the exact definition of holistic? Listen.
*  And I said I could smell bullshit.
*  You know, I met the guy.
*  I'm like, again, I was expecting half a hippie and he's OK.
*  Characterized by the belief that the parts of something are interconnected
*  and can be explained only by reference to the whole.
*  Well, that's logical.
*  Characterized as a treatment of the whole person taking into account
*  mental and social factors rather than just the symptoms of an illness.
*  Many people conclude that holistic medicines are beneficial.
*  So the problem is not it's the like when I hear that word holistic,
*  I think bullshit already does hippies.
*  Even but if you're talking about medicine, it totally makes sense.
*  I agree. He was just it's been co-opted. Right.
*  It's a good word.
*  We were doing a zoom thing with me, him and my wife, you know,
*  because he wanted her there because, you know, I'm like a big kid.
*  I don't want any vegetables.
*  And I don't know what he's going to tell me to eat and shit.
*  And I'm I don't like eating bad.
*  You know, I'm picky my eating. Right.
*  So I was afraid what he was going to tell me.
*  So when we went on there, he was showing me all the stuff that.
*  Well, let me tell you, I took the shit first.
*  So I was afraid I was afraid of taking the shit
*  because you never know how it comes out.
*  And I was really like, I didn't know where to do it.
*  So I went to my home.
*  I went to you. I don't have to hear about it.
*  You're in now.
*  Yeah, you're in the store.
*  So I go to my school.
*  Listen, I like to keep stuff somewhat spicy with me and my wife.
*  So I don't want to do that.
*  My house guy for me that goes all over.
*  So I go to my my shower at my my my school. Right.
*  And I'm basically I and I thank goodness it wasn't all over the place.
*  And I was doing more of like a standing like I was almost like a rodeo rider.
*  So you're catching it.
*  Yeah, you know, you really got to make sure your wrist stays parallel.
*  Yeah. Could you imagine for real?
*  You get a little accidental dip?
*  Yeah, I was just I was in the shower.
*  I know what's bad about it is if you take everything, everything,
*  everything, there's nothing good about it.
*  But I have to know what's going on with my gut.
*  So so after I took the shit, you got to it's almost like
*  and it really ruined my love of Nutella,
*  because I used to always like the fucking little scoops with the
*  because you got to take a little spoon in your shit.
*  And he goes, make sure you get different sides of it.
*  There's a watery part of this.
*  Oh, my God.
*  So I'm in there and you got to do the and you got to put it in a little vial
*  and gossip.
*  You guys wanted to hear about it.
*  So after that, you take it, you shake it off
*  and then you put it in an envelope and you ship it off.
*  So that was the story of that.
*  And then when they seen like the stuff that was highlighted in the red,
*  the red zone, like what is going to be affecting my gut?
*  Like I had I said there was like a parasite.
*  You had spaghetti.
*  Yeah, you know, we're out of it.
*  So there was like a parasite.
*  All right. Well, there's I don't know what the fuck he goes.
*  You usually get this something that you have used.
*  Do you have animals?
*  I'm like, no, I don't fucking have animals.
*  I don't know what the fuck.
*  But there was also like a big bacteria in there, you know.
*  So the clear of that bacteria, I'm drinking a shake, this thorn type shake.
*  I know it's called thorn, but it's that I'm on different supplements from
*  I don't eat I don't eat vegetables.
*  So there's these I got these four green pills on.
*  I mean, you got me on supplements and we'll see how it goes.
*  It's fresh. It's only like a weekend
*  because it took me forever to do that shit in the box.
*  So I'll let you know how it works.
*  I don't know how it is yet.
*  Our issue fear was on Legion of Skanks, this podcast they do.
*  So they did film it live in front of an audience.
*  And Ari had taken a shit in a Tupperware
*  and brought it on stage and who did you give it to?
*  Lewis Gomez? No. Why would you give it to Big J?
*  Yeah, birthday surprise.
*  It was a birthday surprise.
*  No, Ari is out of his fucking mind, dude.
*  So he opens up, they open up this Tupperware and the smell.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah, that's come on.
*  Oh, man.
*  People start running out of the room.
*  Good Lord. Is there video of that?
*  There's nothing worse than the smell of human shit.
*  I don't know. Especially with someone else.
*  Yeah, right. Yeah.
*  Mine is bad enough. Mine's bad enough.
*  Yeah. Like when you take a horrific shit,
*  it's a bit and someone in your family goes in there after you
*  and you're like, I'm so sorry.
*  I'm sorry, Menace, but I'm going to do it.
*  You met my boy, Menace. Yeah. Yeah.
*  We were in California.
*  We were hanging out.
*  We hit one of them Del tacos.
*  So food was fucking all right.
*  He's got to take a shit.
*  He comes out of the fucking bathroom, dry heaving, his eyes, water
*  and from his own shit.
*  That is the fucking you know, Menace, too.
*  That amazed me.
*  I was like, come out. I'm talking.
*  He was like, what's the name of his diner?
*  Valentino's love it.
*  Well, that is hilarious.
*  Your own shit is so bad.
*  You're dry.
*  Come on.
*  This is it.
*  No, go from the beginning.
*  Go to the beginning.
*  I don't think you'll see it.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  Oh, man.
*  Look at his smile.
*  Is that Mickey?
*  He's so proud.
*  I'm gagging just looking at that.
*  That's disgusting.
*  That's Mickey go right there.
*  It looks like Mickey.
*  I think it is Mickey.
*  I think it is Mickey.
*  Dude, I legit almost threw up.
*  Did you see that, Jamie?
*  I legit almost threw up.
*  I can't look at that.
*  Can that off the screen?
*  I will throw up.
*  How about Ari not even look away from it?
*  I know, right?
*  What is this?
*  He looks like a proud dad.
*  He's fucking smiling.
*  Come on.
*  Like a proud dad.
*  He's just dying laughing.
*  Look at what I did.
*  Oh, he's so happy.
*  It is funny, though.
*  He's the best.
*  Ari is the best.
*  He's such a psycho.
*  He's crazy.
*  Is he still training?
*  He's so crazy.
*  No, he fucked his knee up.
*  Fucked his knee up, then quit.
*  He trained for a little bit.
*  Got a brand new knee.
*  Everybody's tapping out now.
*  They got their fucking knees.
*  Well, you're still rolling even with the new knee.
*  I am, but I'm a little more choosy with my picky.
*  Does it have the same stability?
*  He lost you first.
*  Does it have the same stability?
*  What is it like?
*  The problem is I was rolling with one of my buddies, Abe,
*  my black belt Abe.
*  And I'd always meet up with him because we
*  have nice training sessions.
*  And I don't think it's my knee as much.
*  Remember I told you I tore my quad in the rehab?
*  I was stepping down too high, and I tore that shit.
*  So it's a little deformed.
*  And I went to butterfly sweep him.
*  And when I went to butterfly sweep him,
*  something popped on the outside.
*  Like if I show you my leg, it's a little something
*  on that knee.
*  And I don't know what I strained or what I pulled.
*  I don't know what MCLs I have left.
*  I don't know what the fuck's there.
*  But it felt weak for a bit after that.
*  So I haven't rolled super hard since.
*  And that was over a month ago.
*  Did you do any of that knees over toes stuff?
*  I heard about that, man.
*  I've seen guys do it.
*  And it seems like it works.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  It does work.
*  Does it work?
*  Yeah, I hear it a lot.
*  Knees over, there's a guy, Knees Over Toes guy on Instagram.
*  And this dude had gone through a bunch of knee surgeries
*  and real problems and realized that part of the problem
*  was he wasn't strengthening all of the stabilizing muscles
*  all in and around his knee with like tibia raises
*  and those step downs and walking backwards on a treadmill.
*  And then I was led to.
*  Yeah.
*  And Nordic curls when you're lying on your chest
*  and you bring your body up only with your legs.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
*  I do those every day.
*  I do those, too, on a slant board.
*  Yeah, I have a slant board.
*  But those Nordic curls are so fucking hard to do.
*  Like when you first do it, you're like, oh, my God.
*  This is crazy.
*  Dude, they're super hard to do.
*  So the whole idea is about strengthening all the muscles
*  that stabilize the knee.
*  And most people are just using the leg.
*  And they're hoping that all that work gets done.
*  But if you really want to make your legs really strong
*  where the knees are really stable,
*  you really want to do things that stabilize that.
*  I mean, you think about how much of a knee injury
*  puts you out.
*  Every elite athlete should be doing this kind of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I have pretty bad patellar tendonitis in my left knee.
*  And it's helped pretty much eliminate it.
*  Yeah, it's pretty impressive stuff.
*  And this guy gives it all away for free.
*  Because his philosophy was, look,
*  if I was an 11-year-old that had a knee injury,
*  I would want this available to me.
*  And so he's a fucking awesome guy.
*  And he's been on the podcast before.
*  Oh, yeah?
*  Yeah.
*  I got to start doing that shit.
*  But his stuff is rock solid, man.
*  I mean, my knees feel so much better doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  Split squats, slant board, bodyweight squats.
*  I do 100 of those every day.
*  I do the Nordic curls.
*  I do all that shit.
*  That's where I got to get on that slant board
*  and step off and touch your heel to the floor, too.
*  That's going to be great.
*  I got to be more disciplined with that shit.
*  You use the sled, the backwards, walking backwards
*  with the sled?
*  I'll do it for like 10 minutes.
*  Amazing.
*  Throw a couple plates on and just, you know?
*  Back and forth, back and forth.
*  So that worked, because I got no meniscus in my left knee.
*  And I just always feel the bone grinding.
*  We were talking about the cadaver meniscus.
*  They do do that now.
*  You looked at any like Gel 1 or Sinvisc 2?
*  Like sometimes you can get a shot that
*  will help with some of that.
*  It only lasts four to six months,
*  but it's better than having your knee grind.
*  I got one of those once, and it didn't really seem to help me.
*  Didn't help you?
*  No.
*  I mean, mine I liked.
*  And then I got the stem cells.
*  But I've talked to people that had no meniscus at all,
*  and they got one of those things.
*  And it was like my knee was brand new again for months.
*  I had a guy.
*  He's a firefighter.
*  My buddy Carl, his knee was jacked.
*  And he's the one that told me about the Gel 1 and all.
*  And he was doing it.
*  And it allowed him to come back and train and everything.
*  And eventually, insurance wouldn't pay for the shot,
*  but they would pay for his knee replacement.
*  It's so crazy.
*  Instead of a $1,500 shot, they'll pay 50 Gs.
*  It's a scam.
*  Such a joke.
*  The thing with those knees, though, me and you last night,
*  I'm not doing that without my new knee.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Walking around town.
*  I'm not doing that.
*  I'd go to Tropicana for a fight.
*  And I'd be with my buddy.
*  And we'd have to stop every how many feet?
*  I'm like, y'all, we got to chill.
*  I'm like, dude, he's like, dude, it's time.
*  I couldn't walk.
*  So now I could come back.
*  That's why I'm not getting the other one done until I have to.
*  My problem was any time I would injure something,
*  I would not give it enough time.
*  I would get stem cells.
*  I'm like, that's everybody's.
*  I would not give it enough time.
*  I'd be like, it's good enough.
*  And then it would get aggravated again.
*  It's like, god damn it, now it's chronic.
*  See, I don't like to do all those exercises and shit.
*  I think I'm scarred from all the.
*  The only way I like to stay in shape.
*  Just some training camp.
*  Why training camp?
*  Longo has some old school shit.
*  Longo's the best.
*  I love Ray Longo.
*  You two would be the greatest reality show of all time.
*  Oh my god, you're a git.
*  That would, here's another.
*  What am I, UFC producer?
*  Here's another one.
*  You two, the two.
*  Picture, imagine that.
*  Longo's one of a kind, Longo.
*  Yeah, he's one of my favorite people.
*  Longo's just an old school guy.
*  Never had a contract with anybody.
*  Just always there helping people for the right reasons.
*  Not just to get his face in there.
*  Nowadays, he's just a bunch of fucking whores out there.
*  He's just a real man.
*  Yeah, he's a real man.
*  For sure.
*  I fucking love that guy.
*  But I love the two of you together.
*  When you guys were in the corner.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  There's no corner like that.
*  It's amazing.
*  There's no corner in MMA like that one.
*  It's so fun.
*  It's also rock solid information.
*  Yeah.
*  He knows that.
*  We keep it very simple.
*  It's just crazy nowadays.
*  It's a little weird now with the whole team.
*  Times change and stuff,
*  but everybody's out in Vegas now.
*  The whole team's like,
*  I mean everybody's doing well.
*  So we're all happy for everybody.
*  But Vegas is very tempting for young fighters.
*  And I don't blame them.
*  Well the facility really,
*  I think is gonna pull people out.
*  The PI, all your food is taken care of.
*  And you have the most sophisticated
*  training environment available on earth.
*  And if there's something better,
*  they're gonna get it.
*  Whatever the fuck it is.
*  And they say, I mean it's a beautiful thing.
*  I think it's fantastic.
*  The only thing I think it sucks for
*  is that you have these guys who are coming up
*  with their people at home.
*  Then they get to where they're at the UFC.
*  They get to the PI, which is awesome.
*  And then some school in Vegas is claiming,
*  and I'm no slam on Couture's team.
*  Like Nick said, he's a great coach.
*  But if I got a guy who's out here
*  and he's been with you for a few months,
*  you can't take credit for that guy.
*  I think in a perfect world.
*  And it's not his fault either.
*  He just is there.
*  And it just makes sense.
*  But I think in a perfect world, they collaborate.
*  And then they're both there.
*  I think in a perfect world, that's how you do it.
*  I mean that's what Greg Jackson and Farras Ahabi
*  and all those guys did when they were trading fighters
*  back and forth.
*  And they all trained together.
*  That's the way to do it.
*  But you never leave your original team if they're good.
*  If it works out and you have a relationship with them,
*  you figure it out together.
*  Unless you're trapped in a too small of an environment
*  and your coach is just not able to fit the needs of like,
*  you know, there's some guys that are just super talented,
*  but they start out in the middle of nowhere.
*  And you know, they don't have a real good gym.
*  The guy doesn't really know the high level shit.
*  I think that's the best thing ever for the fighters.
*  It's sick.
*  I'm in Vegas all the time and I'm working
*  with all kind of fighters.
*  And I would never ask anybody to leave their team.
*  In fact, I'm like, listen,
*  I'll give you any information you want.
*  Beautiful.
*  But you can't leave your team.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Like, I'm not taking you.
*  I don't want you.
*  Good, beautiful.
*  I mean, also taxes, they save money with taxes out there.
*  It's very, it's very desirable.
*  But it also creates a conflict
*  where the conflict's not necessary, right?
*  It's cause it's like, he's for sure getting new information.
*  Guys getting new information from NICSIC.
*  You get new information from training with everybody.
*  Usually you're on a path,
*  but you're on a path with the people
*  that you started the path with.
*  Right, yeah.
*  And it's like, even if you're in this new place,
*  like maybe you're enhancing your education,
*  you're getting better at fighting.
*  You're still, those are your people.
*  And you want what you want, what's best for them
*  if you really care for them.
*  But at the same time, like, what did you sign up for?
*  What did I sign up for?
*  Like, I'm not gonna be in a corner with somebody
*  and I could like them.
*  But, you know, me and Longo,
*  what we did is with me and Longo, some local kids,
*  at this time when it's like, all right,
*  Al's from Wantoor, Wyman's from Baldwin.
*  They're all local kids.
*  Who's fighting?
*  This one's taking out the best of Brazil.
*  This one's we're going to Australia.
*  Al's fucking up this guy in London.
*  This was, this is what I'm a part of.
*  Me and Longo taking all guys to the flag pole.
*  And then who's with us?
*  Aljo or Al is our third guy.
*  I'm not, I didn't sign on for anything else.
*  Like in other words, I wanna make these guys
*  the best they can.
*  But once it gets to a certain degree now where it's like,
*  all right, man, this guy's gonna be in the corner
*  and this, all right, well now that you guys
*  are calling the shots, you don't need me no more.
*  Cause I'm not gonna be fucking in there.
*  Okay, is it my turn to take the towel in?
*  Fuck everybody, I'm out.
*  Who wants to go in this time?
*  Nick Sick, John Wood, who wants to?
*  And I love those guys.
*  They're good guys.
*  I like them, they're good.
*  I'm friendly with them.
*  But I'm not a part of that.
*  Like I don't, and I want the best for my fucking guys.
*  I love those guys.
*  Fucking Marab's gonna be the next champ.
*  Fucking.
*  But Marab is unstoppable.
*  I love that guy.
*  When he was carrying Henry Cejudo with his tongue out.
*  Oh yeah, I know.
*  And he's like a baby.
*  Savage moment.
*  What a savage, but walking over to Mark Zuckerberg,
*  holding Henry fucking Cejudo, two division world champion.
*  Gold medalist.
*  Embarrassed.
*  Look at that, that's insane.
*  Marab, the thing is with Marab.
*  He's a savage.
*  In all my years, I've never seen a gas tank like that.
*  I never have.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's incredible because it's not like he's slow.
*  Like you generally associate really high level endurance
*  with guys that maybe don't have the kind of power he has.
*  But he's also, he's durable.
*  If you watched his fight with Marlon Marab.
*  Yes, yes.
*  He got one man.
*  Not only did he get dropped,
*  it was almost about to get stopped,
*  but then it was almost by the end of the round,
*  not only did he recover,
*  he was beating the shit out of Mark.
*  Like just beating it, it almost ended in the other way.
*  He might have won back that round.
*  I never seen, I'm like, holy fuck.
*  He's an animal.
*  I'll tell you.
*  Dude, his social media is getting funny too.
*  Yeah, he's the best.
*  He's the best.
*  He's the best.
*  He's an animal.
*  And I'm happy that him and Aljo never fought.
*  They never, you know what I mean?
*  That's a beautiful thing.
*  Did Aljo have to go up?
*  Is he like really struggling?
*  Why did he decide to go up?
*  Well, I think it's time.
*  I think, I mean, you'd have to ask him,
*  but it was a hard for him to get down to that weight.
*  I'm sure, I mean, he's done it.
*  He's a pro.
*  He's so good at that weight though.
*  Yeah, but man, he'll strangle guys the size of Rallo.
*  I've seen him.
*  Oh, I'm sure he can, but I can't say coming up with
*  Calc-Cator.
*  But I always felt that he had like really good endurance
*  for a guy who cuts that much weight
*  and he could push a pace and his size
*  and the grappling advantage.
*  When he strangled Corey Sanhagen,
*  I was like, holy shit.
*  That was impressive.
*  Holy shit.
*  But I think he's gonna be better now.
*  So I've been working with him a little bit,
*  just talking to him and kind of consulting with him.
*  Yeah, he's healthier now.
*  He's not concerned about his weight.
*  And that was a big part for him at 35 is like
*  half of his camp was just making weight.
*  And as he like puts it,
*  do you think there should be more weight classes?
*  I think so.
*  I think so.
*  I think there should have been back in fucking 2001.
*  I was a fucking tweeter, man.
*  155 was fucking hard for me, man.
*  But I was like golem on that fucking scale.
*  But 170, imagine me now at 170
*  with fucking MVPs and all these motherfuckers.
*  I'll be up to the dick.
*  Right, yeah.
*  That's true.
*  First of all, people are shit on that guy.
*  Bro, how does MVP make 170?
*  I have no idea.
*  Hey, what did you think of his, I liked his,
*  everybody shit on him.
*  I was impressed by him.
*  I liked his appearance.
*  Listen, that's what he,
*  that's what I always was saying.
*  He handled Kevin Holland easily.
*  I was telling people those point fighters,
*  the guys who are elite at that skill
*  of blitzing in, that's a very specific skill.
*  It's hard to handle.
*  And if you're just used to guys Muay Thai in you
*  and then some guy is doing that, it's wild, wild.
*  I was a tough dude, man.
*  When I trained Tyron for Wonder Boy,
*  we brought in karate people.
*  We went to karate schools looking for the best karate guys
*  just to be able to deal with that aspect of the fight.
*  Yeah, well, I still think Wonder Boy won.
*  So what do you think of that?
*  I think Tyron handled Wonder Boy better than anybody
*  in Wonder Boy's prime.
*  I think he handled him better than anybody
*  because he just waited on him.
*  He did a lot of waiting on him, but he fucked him up.
*  He rocked him twice, like bad.
*  And Wonder Boy was the guy thought to be the striker.
*  I never really watched.
*  I saw some highlights of Michael Page,
*  Michael Vanem Page from Bellator,
*  but I never really watched.
*  I just don't know when they're on, to be honest.
*  He's sensational.
*  He is.
*  People were shitting on his appearance.
*  I thought it was great.
*  He fought Kevin Holland.
*  The first fight in the UFC.
*  The first fight in the UFC,
*  he jumped into the deep end of the pool
*  with a real dangerous guy who's got one punch knockout power
*  from his fucking back.
*  Remember that shit when he knocked down
*  Jacques Array from his back.
*  Hey, it's the first guy in there,
*  whoever fucking, Kevin Holland, Kevin Holland.
*  You understand?
*  Like, Kevin Holland's usually talking shit,
*  winning or losing.
*  He's on the bottom of the aisle,
*  like, hey, you're stronger than I thought.
*  He had him a little fucking...
*  Perplexed.
*  Yeah, I remember when,
*  I like to hear a lot of times when they go back to the corner.
*  Dude, he was mentally beat after the first round.
*  It really sounded like...
*  You can't hit that guy, and when you get close,
*  he's so creative.
*  Those spinning elbows he kept hitting him with.
*  Oh, I know.
*  He said he's faster than we thought.
*  He's faster than we thought, yeah.
*  And they go, you gotta cut him off.
*  He goes, he's not there.
*  Like, you know, it was...
*  It's a different thing.
*  He's doing that point karate type movement.
*  Like, this is just, and he trained it over and over again.
*  It's that ability to move in and out
*  and his footwork is so sensational.
*  It's like, that is a different thing to deal with.
*  It's like wrestlers.
*  If you're used to grappling on your knees only,
*  and then all of a sudden you have to wrestle,
*  what the fuck?
*  It's a big difference.
*  It's kind of like that.
*  These guys, their ability to close distance
*  and that sideways stance.
*  Machito had, you know, same style.
*  Wonder Boy did it the best in the UFC.
*  Yeah.
*  Wonder Boy did wild shit in the UFC.
*  It's such a different style,
*  and my little Jimmy Bird is always like,
*  they keep their hands down.
*  I got you, Jimmy.
*  It's a fucking...
*  Remember Wonder Boy, Jake Ellenberger?
*  Oh, that's the wheel kick.
*  And this was like after Jake Ellenberger had said
*  he's not gonna hit me when in that fancy spinning shit.
*  Oh no, he laughed.
*  He goes, I'm karate.
*  He goes, that's cute.
*  Something like that.
*  Yeah.
*  And he got embarrassed.
*  I think Wonder Boy has the perfect con.
*  Here's the perfect con.
*  He's genuinely the nicest guy in the world.
*  He's handsome and wholesome.
*  He's just a sweet, sweet guy.
*  That's like a mask that a killer wears.
*  And the killer wears that mask.
*  Then he's fucking piecing you up,
*  and you're like, oh no.
*  What about the Jeff Neal fight?
*  Yeah, but that's what he did with Jeff.
*  What he did with Jeff Neal was he pretended to be his friend.
*  In the little cage too.
*  In the little cage.
*  You get real confused.
*  Back up a little bit so you can see before it.
*  You get real confused with this dude,
*  and you get confused by the way he looks
*  and how nice he talks.
*  He's a fucking karate assassin.
*  He's so good.
*  Probably the greatest karate fighter
*  that's ever fought in MMA.
*  He's so good.
*  I mean, there's Raymond Daniels.
*  He was another guy that was like an elite point fighting guy
*  that's also a kickboxer that fought in glory.
*  Yeah, Raymond Daniels is good.
*  He's the guy that has that 720 degree punch.
*  Yeah.
*  He spins in the air and KO's the guy with one punch.
*  It's the craziest thing you've ever seen.
*  If you saw it in a movie.
*  You think a kick is coming,
*  and then he just goes whap.
*  What do you think you saw in a movie?
*  He's a California guy.
*  Or that's where his gym is, I believe.
*  Oh, I see.
*  Look at this.
*  Oh, he's so dangerous, dude.
*  Raymond Daniels does, watch this.
*  Boom!
*  I mean, come on, son.
*  That is crazy.
*  That's a crazy thing to watch.
*  Yeah, at least I'm not prepared for that.
*  You don't, man.
*  How would you prepare?
*  And in Bellator, he has one of the wildest knockouts,
*  excuse me, not Bellator, in glory, in glory kickboxing.
*  He has this touch sidekick,
*  jump spinning back kick to the face KO
*  high level kickboxing match, man.
*  But the way he set it up, watch this.
*  This is a thing of beauty.
*  Watch this here.
*  Boom!
*  Oh, man.
*  What?
*  What?
*  What the fuck is that?
*  Show that again, show that again.
*  Look at that, dude.
*  Are you fucking kidding me?
*  I don't even know.
*  I think he kicked him in his neck.
*  But he's still fighting.
*  Like he's fighting in karate combat.
*  That's why that shirt on.
*  Bro, Raymond Daniels.
*  Raymond Daniels, dude.
*  Raymond Daniels, danger.
*  And Raymond Daniels and Michael Venom Page
*  fought, I believe, back in the day
*  in a point fighting match.
*  So those guys that can cover distance like that,
*  that's a different thing, man.
*  It's a different thing.
*  I like that he's part of the UFC
*  because there's so many nice matchups.
*  At first I was liking maybe him versus won the boy.
*  Then I was thinking about it more and I'm like, wait a minute.
*  It might as well just fucking watch karate combat.
*  It might as well just be that.
*  But there's a lot of nice matchups.
*  And he didn't look like he had those UFC jitters.
*  Not at all.
*  No, he looked like he was enjoying himself.
*  I was impressed.
*  He's really dangerous, man.
*  He's just so tall and such a sniper.
*  And just that movement, good luck finding anybody
*  to emulate that shit in camp.
*  You know, you gotta get Raymond Daniels.
*  Also, if your whole life is spent fighting
*  at a certain pace and a certain distance,
*  and all of a sudden this guy moves it by 30%.
*  30% is crazy.
*  He's way back here.
*  He's way back here and he's standing in front of you.
*  He's moving around.
*  And you try to close the distance and they're just so fast.
*  They beat you to it.
*  You remember when Leota Machida knocked out Ryan Bader?
*  Ryan Bader's trying to close the distance.
*  And Leota just planted a left hand on him.
*  It's like, whoa.
*  It was like that style is very hard to deal with
*  if someone's really good at it
*  and they can do the other shit too.
*  Yeah.
*  If they can do the other shit too.
*  If they can defend a takedown, they'll get it.
*  I'm so interested in Jamal Hill and Pineda.
*  I'm so interested in that fight.
*  I know.
*  I am so interested in that fight.
*  Do you think his Achilles is straight?
*  Dude, I don't know.
*  I mean, I would assume it is,
*  otherwise he wouldn't be jumping back in.
*  I know it was more than eight months.
*  Is that what they say it takes?
*  How many months ago did Jamal Hill injure his Achilles?
*  He doesn't get-
*  I was there at the game.
*  He was playing too.
*  They was all playing a basketball game.
*  It's always something stupid.
*  It's never a Jiu-Jitsu.
*  He can hoop though.
*  Jamal Hill can play.
*  And he somehow, some bump.
*  Yeah, god damn, that's crazy.
*  Okay, so this was in July.
*  So August, September, October, November, December,
*  January, February, March, eight.
*  Ooh, I'd like to have a little more.
*  I'd like to have a little more.
*  We don't know.
*  I would assume he's had to be on the BPCs.
*  No, you can't.
*  You can't.
*  Even as an injury?
*  No, you can't.
*  It's so stupid.
*  So they can't even get permission to use it?
*  You can do stem cells.
*  They can do PRP.
*  They can do a lot of things.
*  It's so silly.
*  He sure as Achilles injury fully healed ahead of UFC 300.
*  It's not a problem at all.
*  Hey man, I don't think he gets-
*  Question's gonna be, is wrestling.
*  I don't think he gets enough props, first of all.
*  I think he's a fucking beast.
*  Jamal Hill's fucking dangerous.
*  Watch the fight with Glover.
*  Yeah, watch the fight with Glover.
*  I watched the piece the other day.
*  He pieced Glover up.
*  And Glover is fucking good.
*  I know.
*  To piece him up like that on the feet.
*  Taking away his singles real quick.
*  Yeah, people underestimate him for some strange reason.
*  And they don't understand it.
*  I've heard people talk about his power.
*  Watch that Johnny Walker fight.
*  I know the Johnny Walker fight.
*  He hit him in the forehead.
*  It's like he got hit by a sniper.
*  The OSP fight?
*  Yeah, man.
*  He's good, man.
*  Bro, he's good.
*  He's fucking dangerous.
*  Show me somebody that did something to him standing up.
*  Cause I'm not finding it.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I'm not finding it.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  I think Alex is gonna be so confident.
*  You know, shit happens.
*  But I think Alex is gonna be so confident
*  because of all his kickboxing and everything else
*  that with these little gloves,
*  I think Jamal's gonna surprise him.
*  He's gonna fucking sharp shoot him.
*  Jamal's a one punch knockout striker
*  at light heavyweight for sure.
*  And he's a big tall dude.
*  And he knows movement.
*  He's fucking dangerous, man.
*  He's good at keeping his range.
*  Bro, he's fucking dangerous.
*  Jamal's dangerous.
*  I mean, a lot of people are picking Paheta
*  to run him over.
*  Really?
*  Which I think is interesting.
*  Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
*  I'm not sure about that, man.
*  Dude, I think this is gonna be a great fight.
*  Oh yeah.
*  The thing about Paheta though is he's ultra high level.
*  Like people just think about only his power
*  and you only think about like,
*  cause he's got that,
*  he's got the most insane touch of death.
*  It's insane.
*  He just sleeps people with everything.
*  But when you see his movement
*  and that sneaky shit he does
*  where he gets that calf kickoff,
*  you don't see.
*  Yeah, you don't even see it coming.
*  You don't see shit, man.
*  You don't see shit.
*  And when he checks his kicks,
*  he doesn't check them.
*  He gets his foot like a hacky sack position.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He lifts his shin up so you just sliding under it.
*  You ain't getting shit.
*  And he's coming down with the right hand every time.
*  He's good, man.
*  He's fucking good.
*  I think the speed of Jamal Hill
*  is gonna be the difference.
*  As long as he has it
*  and that Achilles doesn't hinder him.
*  Yeah, well, god damn it would suck
*  if he came in at 70%.
*  Oh shit, not 100.
*  Cause he's gonna need to be 100.
*  The thing is, there's gotta be a lot of pressure
*  to be UFC 300.
*  And you might be, I can do it, I can do it.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm hoping it's 100%.
*  I just hope they for sure got him some stem cells.
*  And I would imagine,
*  he's an elite UFC world championship caliber athlete.
*  He's the world champ.
*  He just relinquished his title.
*  No doubt.
*  I mean, he's fighting for his title essentially.
*  Cause he didn't lose.
*  He gave it up.
*  He got injured.
*  I bet he only gave it up
*  cause Urie gave it up too.
*  I mean, it's basic what he said when he gave it up.
*  It's kinda like,
*  that's honorable, right?
*  Yeah, that's how it is.
*  Said Urie got out of the way.
*  I'm gonna get out of the way.
*  I'm not gonna hold up.
*  And that's why I like them guys
*  because what other division would do that?
*  What other guys,
*  I don't think anybody else would do that.
*  Well, those guys are warriors.
*  That is a warrior division.
*  Even Urie who thought the fight was prematurely stopped,
*  he wouldn't say it inside the octagon.
*  Like afterwards he said.
*  Right, he was just like, yeah.
*  I like that.
*  After he said he coulda continued.
*  I hate when guys are bitching right afterwards
*  or they start talking about the injuries they had
*  and everything.
*  That one was a,
*  that was a close one though.
*  When you watch that one,
*  you're like, ooh, you coulda won it.
*  One or two more seconds.
*  I thought it was,
*  I mean, close,
*  but I thought it was a fair stoppage too.
*  I thought fair stoppage too.
*  Same Dr. Aaron Rodgers had.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Okay.
*  Went to the right guy, right?
*  I bet Jamal got all the good stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's good then.
*  Cause. Hopefully.
*  He gonna need it.
*  Yeah, Aaron Rodgers was,
*  he was practicing quite a bit.
*  It was like five months in already.
*  Yeah.
*  He said like his strength of the leg wasn't the same.
*  His ability to push off,
*  it wasn't the same,
*  but you know,
*  so it was getting a lot better.
*  I just don't want Jamal to be compromised in any way
*  in that fight.
*  It's such a big fight.
*  Yeah.
*  But like I said, man,
*  his speed and his instincts and his vision,
*  it's just different.
*  And he's,
*  he has that,
*  he's got that boxing punching set where he throws straight
*  where, you know,
*  Paeda is a little loopier.
*  Well, Paeda does fight with his hands way low too.
*  And he kind of like lures guys into these slugfest
*  because he's got such insane counter power.
*  His one loss,
*  Jamal Hills from that fucking arm-wreck triangle
*  from Paul Craig.
*  That could happen to anybody.
*  Paul Craig has one of the most dangerous guards
*  in any fucking division.
*  I love it.
*  Period.
*  I love it.
*  Period. Full stop.
*  I know.
*  Remember he caught Ankaliya one second to go in the fight.
*  One second to go.
*  He catches him in a triangle.
*  How does he got wins over Jamal Hill and Ankaliya?
*  That's how good his guard is.
*  His guard is sensational.
*  His guard is what everybody's guard should strive to be.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  That's what I love and I still,
*  it'll never go out of style
*  no matter what happens with Jiu Jitsu.
*  Like, you know,
*  like at my school I have everybody doing the latest
*  fucking leg locks to this and that.
*  But this is a horrible one.
*  Cause he broke his arm too.
*  Yeah. Dislocated.
*  His arm is completely flopping around.
*  It's already broken by this point.
*  He's still trying to fight though.
*  That's the fucking-
*  Oh, Jamal's an animal.
*  Look at it. He's still not-
*  He's such a warrior, dude.
*  They stopped the fight.
*  He wasn't quitting.
*  He's a beast.
*  And his arm is fucked.
*  He just looks at it.
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucked.
*  You remember what it looked like
*  when it was going backwards?
*  It was horrific, man.
*  It was horrific.
*  I think he's winning the fight to be honest with you.
*  I do. And I like Alex.
*  I think he's- Really?
*  I swear I think he's winning the fight.
*  He doesn't-
*  Listen, I think it's a very interesting fight.
*  Dude, the odds are real close on it, so-
*  It should be.
*  I think it's a pick them fight too.
*  I can see a bunch of scenarios going both ways.
*  I think people underestimate Jamal.
*  The thing is though, Jamal does stand with like,
*  almost like a boxing stance sometimes.
*  I wonder how good he's gonna be
*  of getting away from the calf kick.
*  That is such a primary weapon in Pajetas
*  cause he's so fucking sneaky with it.
*  And his is the best.
*  And even though everybody knows that he's sneaky with it,
*  it's still hard to, you can't defend it.
*  The one thing about Jamal, he's smart though.
*  Jamal is a very intelligent fighter.
*  For a young guy, he's very cerebral.
*  I think he understands that that might be a problem.
*  So he should have an answer for it early.
*  Mm-mm, yeah.
*  You gotta have an answer for that.
*  And it's also, he's got all these combinations
*  that he sets up that are based on your reaction
*  to certain movements.
*  And he like repeats these patterns and fights,
*  and it's always surprising.
*  The way he's able to land those things is so surprising.
*  And he's just got this very specific strategy.
*  I'm gonna kill that leg.
*  And then you're fucked and I hit really hard.
*  And you're not gonna be able to get out of the way.
*  Did you ever get hit with one of those calf kicks?
*  No.
*  Me neither, I'm happy I didn't.
*  No, I'm happy that shit was out.
*  How do people play it?
*  Just play kick me and it hurts like hell.
*  I did before they were a thing.
*  And I think it was my fight against Josh Neer.
*  And he seemed like the dude who would use a calf kick.
*  But they wanted to think that I think it was an accident.
*  And he kicked me in the calf
*  and I swear I thought my leg was broke.
*  Wow.
*  I was like, I couldn't walk.
*  I thought my leg was broke.
*  Now imagine Paheta.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  Imagine a dude slamming him repeatedly.
*  He fucked up Jan Bojovic's shit.
*  Jan Bojovic is literally made out of rocks.
*  Yeah.
*  That dude is made out of rocks.
*  I guarantee you if they do some bone density
*  he's got some fucking Viking rock bones.
*  That dude hits so goddamn hard.
*  Hey, but what about the BMF?
*  I'm interested in that too.
*  Max Engagey, you're not really interested in that one?
*  I am interested in that.
*  You know why I'm interested in that?
*  Because people are counting Max out.
*  I'm not.
*  I think Max might win.
*  Max is one of my favorites.
*  Max has had a lot of time to prepare.
*  Justin's a 230 favorite.
*  I would not take that.
*  Can I just say that they're basing a lot of that shit
*  on his fight versus Dustin Poirier.
*  If you hear Max talk about it,
*  he had only six weeks to prepare for that thing.
*  And he was doing this for like 10 or so weeks.
*  And I don't know, man, Max is an intelligent guy.
*  I was there, we were there live
*  when he fought Calvin Cader.
*  And he's looking away.
*  I'm the best boxer.
*  And he moves his head and he fucking hits it.
*  And you remember where Dana was?
*  Dana was like, somebody needs to stop this.
*  Dana was like scared for Calvin Cader's life.
*  He could have stopped.
*  He put a real beating on Calvin
*  that takes a long time to recover from.
*  I mean, the amount of punches
*  that he landed on Calvin were insane.
*  My thing with the Dustin and Max fight
*  was I thought Dustin just physically
*  bullied him around the ring.
*  Dustin's a big 55 too.
*  I think that's gonna be a problem.
*  If my perception's right, then that would be a problem
*  because I think Justin's stronger and more of a bully.
*  And his leg kicks, which Max never seems to check,
*  I think his leg kicks could present a problem.
*  That could be a real problem.
*  Because he had a problem with that with Volkanovsky.
*  And the thing about Gagey is Gagey lands them in the clinch.
*  He can be standing like.
*  It's insane.
*  I know, yeah, his distance for that.
*  His flexibility is insane.
*  It's insane.
*  This was such a beating.
*  This was a beating, man.
*  This was wild, man.
*  This was wild live because it was during the.
*  And Calvin Cader, I mean, he's a fucking dangerous dude.
*  He's got real good boxing.
*  And he just couldn't touch Max.
*  I see a single for Aljo.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that leg.
*  I told you old Biggie Jones tapped Cader back in the day.
*  That was his first loss.
*  I'm Biggie Jones?
*  One of my guys, James Biggie Jones.
*  One of the reasons why I'm interested in this is because I think Max is going to go into
*  this fight with a tremendous amount of anticipation.
*  This is not a fight that you don't get real scared about.
*  This is a fight you got to really fucking prepare.
*  And when Max gets pushed, you see the best.
*  What is he, 33?
*  He's one of my favorites.
*  Yeah, Max is not out of his prime.
*  He started what, 19?
*  We really kind of put aside when a guy loses the title that maybe they're not as good as
*  they used to be.
*  But Max keeps getting better.
*  Not to mention his nuts.
*  I mean, let's think about when he was going to fight Habib on 24 hours.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I was noticed.
*  So yeah, he's one of my favorite guys without a doubt.
*  One of my favorite fighters.
*  He's a beast and he's a sweetheart of a guy.
*  Good guy.
*  Nicest guy.
*  Yeah, no doubt.
*  Nicest guys.
*  And he talked openly about like why guys like Connor, why those guys gas out guys like Aldo.
*  They got too much power, man.
*  Did you see Roadhouse?
*  I did not see Roadhouse.
*  Is it good?
*  I seen Roadhouse.
*  On a one to ten, how high were you?
*  Oh, you know, compared to what?
*  Like normally.
*  No, no, it's fun.
*  It's like an 80s type movie.
*  It's a little silly in a way.
*  Like, you know, it's not too serious in a sense.
*  But it's fun.
*  I like Jake.
*  Did Jake?
*  He's like Jake.
*  Jake carried the movie.
*  And let me tell you, Connor, what an actor.
*  I mean, he did himself.
*  It's fucking self.
*  Cut down the truck.
*  It was like, yo, what an actor.
*  He's going to take the world Hollywood by storm.
*  He's playing himself basically.
*  Right.
*  Play himself in a bunch of movies about Guy Richie on speed dial.
*  I mean, but all he had was a lot of one liners.
*  So it's easy to deliver one line.
*  Right.
*  Connor McGregor could be a movie star.
*  100%.
*  If The Rock can do it, you don't think Connor McGregor could do it?
*  He got the discipline to do it.
*  100% he could do it.
*  And he's a character, man.
*  Look at him.
*  Look at him.
*  He's a fucking character, dude.
*  I like the part in the movie when he takes the trolley
*  and he throws it into the...
*  Oh, no.
*  That's a different...
*  Oh, no.
*  That happened in real life.
*  You know?
*  But he's a fucking...
*  He's a fucking...
*  Listen, I liked him in the movie, though.
*  He wasn't...
*  He didn't take you out of the movie.
*  Yeah, I thought the movie was cool.
*  You know?
*  Well, I would definitely watch it.
*  It's supposed to be a fun movie.
*  I thought I'm going to get to about nine.
*  It's not the original.
*  On a one to ten, I'll get to about nine.
*  Yeah, get to about nine.
*  That's good.
*  It's a bit corny, but...
*  I like a corny movie.
*  Yeah, if you like corny movies and just want to be entertained,
*  it's the perfect movie.
*  Bro, I loved the first row house.
*  There was no Sam Elliott in this one.
*  There was no Sam Elliott in this one.
*  I didn't have a Sam Elliott character.
*  That disappointed me.
*  That's true.
*  Why wouldn't they have a Sam...
*  They should get that guy from Yellowstone.
*  That old dude with the mustache from Yellowstone.
*  Looks like Sam Elliott.
*  What's that guy's name?
*  Is it real cowboy?
*  Yeah, that's a real cowboy.
*  No, not Rip.
*  But Rip is too tough.
*  The other dude.
*  The older guy.
*  Looks like Sam Elliott.
*  Yeah, he would be perfect.
*  Why can't I have a Sam Elliott?
*  I'm in the last season of Yellowstone.
*  Bro, why didn't they just get fucking actual Sam Elliott?
*  I like Yellowstone.
*  Yeah, right?
*  You want to come back?
*  Yeah, have Sam Elliott.
*  Patrick Swayze is dead, but have actual Sam Elliott come back?
*  Come on, Miho.
*  Who's that handsome fellow back there with that salt and pepper hair?
*  He's a real Marlboro man.
*  For sure, son.
*  What a voice that guy's got.
*  This is such a dumb movie.
*  It is.
*  Dumb as shit.
*  It's so dumb.
*  Cult class.
*  Yeah, wait till you see the new one.
*  It's like The Warriors.
*  Remember the old movie The Warriors?
*  The Warriors.
*  Come out and play.
*  Yeah, my favorite was the baseball crew.
*  Baseball furies.
*  Listen, we talked about Star Wars a little bit.
*  Fuck Star Wars.
*  Ever since...
*  What's that chick?
*  Kathleen Kennedy.
*  Yeah, I love the South Park thing.
*  Oh, brilliant.
*  That's exactly what the fuck they're doing.
*  Cartman hit the nail on the head.
*  But fuck all that shit.
*  The new Star Wars.
*  Fuck all that.
*  And it's pre-Star Wars.
*  Did you see Dune and Dune Part 2?
*  No.
*  Man, you got it.
*  Joe, did you see it?
*  I saw Part 1.
*  I fell asleep.
*  You fucking idiot.
*  I couldn't help it.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Wow.
*  No, it's okay.
*  I love Part 1.
*  That was gotta mean, right?
*  That was gonna mean.
*  That was gonna mean.
*  Sometimes people get tired.
*  Man, I work all day.
*  Listen to me.
*  Sometimes people get tired.
*  These movies are so fucking good.
*  Really?
*  Okay, I'm excited.
*  I'm telling you right now, Josh Brolin's...
*  First of all, I don't think Josh...
*  From Goonies to that, he's never in anything bad.
*  Josh Brolin.
*  He's fucking awesome.
*  He's a man.
*  Momoa was in it.
*  I like the...
*  He could do a couple of push-ups,
*  but I like the Timothy Chamolais.
*  Chamolais?
*  Yeah.
*  No, he isn't.
*  He's in Wonka.
*  He's good.
*  But these movies are so...
*  They're so good.
*  The director, he's a French guy.
*  He also did Blade Runner,
*  the new Blade Runner,
*  which is another very underrated movie.
*  These aren't underrated.
*  These are popular,
*  but Blade Runner is underrated, the new one.
*  He's fucking awesome, man.
*  This guy, what's his name?
*  Yeah.
*  He's fucking phenomenal.
*  Sicario.
*  But Dune I and Dune Part II.
*  He did Arrival II.
*  I'll tell you...
*  Did you see Arrival?
*  Yeah, but I think I forgot about it.
*  Arrival's the one where the alien shit shows up...
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That was good.
*  They speak with weird...
*  Oh, yeah, that's right.
*  They show him.
*  It's fucking dope.
*  Dune, the characters, the fucking...
*  It's so good.
*  Yeah, I haven't seen the second one yet.
*  And it's so funny.
*  In the first one, I don't want to give it away,
*  but the guy he fights at the end of it,
*  it's a guy I had a Jiu Jitsu match versus Babs...
*  I swear to God.
*  I dropped Sayonagi on him.
*  Well, that was your move back in the day.
*  Yeah, man.
*  If you put in Matt versus Babs,
*  you see me throw the fucking guy.
*  But he's actually great in the movie.
*  He's great, Nate.
*  He plays Jamis, part of the Freeman.
*  The Freeman's on Arrakis,
*  and they're on this desert planet,
*  and this big giant worms.
*  Yeah, such a nerd.
*  Another nerd guy.
*  Joe, you look like...
*  When I say all this shit,
*  you're looking at me like you want to unfriend me.
*  I'm fascinated.
*  I'm fascinated.
*  There he is!
*  There he is.
*  He's good.
*  I went versus him in a Jiu Jitsu match,
*  and Minotaur was the ref.
*  Wow.
*  Was that at Naga?
*  Yeah, it's Naga in 1996.
*  If you put in Matt versus Babs...
*  You don't have to.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  It's not about me, but that guy...
*  Get the HD version.
*  Watch your throat.
*  And don't share that video.
*  But I was so happy when I seen it.
*  Well, first of all, look at those abs.
*  You forward it a little bit.
*  After I mount him, he gets up.
*  This is back in the day.
*  This was like Minotaur was the ref.
*  But yeah, you can forward it a tiny bit.
*  After I mount him and I get off mount...
*  Yeah, look at that.
*  This is old school.
*  But once I get off mount...
*  Right now you can pull it right after I missed the arm bar.
*  Now, this is for Paul Atreides.
*  Sorry, if you know what, if you see the movie.
*  Ready?
*  Damn, you almost had that arm bar.
*  I did almost have that.
*  But Hensel got happy for this
*  because he worked on me with his fucking throat.
*  That's two points.
*  Hey, what belt was this?
*  This was when I was a brown belt and he was a purple.
*  Watch one more second because I do a nice back take.
*  You don't have to watch it now.
*  I want Joe to see it because Joe likes Jiu Jitsu.
*  This is our team versus the Alliance team back in the day.
*  And I said the same thing on Gomi.
*  But it looks cool.
*  Because what happens is you go first
*  and it's almost like a second later for him to go.
*  So it looks cool.
*  Look right here.
*  I love that one.
*  That's one of my back takes.
*  Enough of me.
*  I feel like a proud Brad.
*  That's a fun back take.
*  Yeah, he did that in Gomi and Abu Dhabi.
*  It's dramatic.
*  It's also kind of humbling.
*  Your feet are up in the air.
*  You're like, oh, there we go.
*  Everybody's watching.
*  Bam.
*  Fuck.
*  But back to the movies.
*  You're going to love these movies, man.
*  They're really good.
*  They got good characters.
*  They're deep.
*  And the action is fucking good.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  I believe you.
*  It's good.
*  Give it a chance.
*  Even some of like, but I don't believe
*  Timothy Chalamet has beaten this guy in anything
*  other than checkers.
*  I need you to stop.
*  He needs to have some kind of superpower.
*  I'm not buying none of what I was just saying.
*  You know how in Star Wars, like The Force and all that stuff?
*  Dune by Frank Herbert.
*  Stop looking at me, John Rollins.
*  John Rollins, I want to throw you in a locker.
*  Shut up, Rollins.
*  Shit's not happening.
*  It's fucking not happening.
*  So listen.
*  So these books came out in the 70s.
*  And George Lucas got a, he took a lot from this.
*  They use something called The Voice that they control people
*  instead of The Force and shit like that.
*  Right, right, right.
*  But very cool.
*  Josh Brolin for the win.
*  I got to be honest.
*  I like The Force a lot more than The Voice.
*  Yeah.
*  The Voice.
*  You're thinking of The Voice.
*  Maybe The Voice will be with you.
*  You don't seem like a movie guy.
*  I like a few movies.
*  But you seem like the type of guy to like to be outside and hunting.
*  Catching shit with your hands.
*  Like a good old white boy just been out there.
*  I like doing things.
*  Yeah.
*  If you spend too much time watching movies,
*  it's like time you can't be actually doing actual things.
*  I think of it as a reward.
*  If I'm going to watch a movie, it's like I busted my ass all week.
*  Right.
*  I can watch a movie.
*  I had fucking, you know, to kill boredom,
*  like my family went to Texas recently, Dallas,
*  to go visit my sister-in-law and I was by myself.
*  And when you have, you know the deal, Joe,
*  when you have three kids and a wife and you got a routine,
*  it's different when there's nobody home and shit.
*  So I'm like, I just thought I'm just sitting there.
*  There's only so much VR you can play.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Yeah.
*  So I went, so I go to the movies by yourself.
*  And when you go to the movies by yourself in Long Island,
*  it feels different than the city.
*  In the city, I do the-
*  Like a pervert.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a little-
*  It's like some fucking creeper rubbing his dick.
*  The middle of a Goonies movie.
*  So I'm in there by myself watching Frozen.
*  What the fuck?
*  I'm watching it.
*  Let it go.
*  Let it go.
*  Disney movies suck, man.
*  But I'm watching, yeah, so I'm watching.
*  So I watched the fucking movie twice.
*  Wow.
*  Dune twice by yourself?
*  Three hour movies.
*  Don't say I don't have a life.
*  I have a nice life.
*  That's incredible.
*  Just listen.
*  You know what I could do?
*  I could be out getting in trouble.
*  By VR, by-
*  I heard that.
*  No bar fights.
*  Yeah, just VR.
*  You're much better off doing what you're doing.
*  I could have went another route.
*  My wife really, and let me tell you,
*  I didn't tell you this last time, Joe,
*  and he knows my wife at 40 years old had an MMA fight.
*  I saw it.
*  I saw it online.
*  It was fucking phenomenal.
*  It was crazy.
*  I was like, what is Matt Sarah doing in his house?
*  Right, right.
*  I know, right?
*  It's funny that at a later age, as a mother,
*  husband of a guy who was a world champion
*  decides to just start fighting.
*  Fuck it, let's go.
*  She never threw a punch when I won the title.
*  She never threw a punch.
*  Yeah.
*  She was like, Adrian.
*  I said, I said.
*  She was that guy.
*  She'd bring me my Aoki.
*  She's loving.
*  Her personality, man.
*  It wasn't.
*  It's pretty crazy.
*  She'd do the kickboxing between each daughter to lose weight,
*  and then she took a kickboxing match on the Lou Neglia, our buddy,
*  who I used to fight on the, you know?
*  It was awesome.
*  And she was, didn't she become three in a,
*  this is my wife's fight.
*  Look at this.
*  This is me and her before.
*  Is that you with the blue shirt?
*  You're a son of a bitch.
*  Oh my God.
*  That was it.
*  That was it.
*  You're a bitch.
*  You're a bitch.
*  That's the old me.
*  That's awesome.
*  You're a bitch.
*  You're a bitch.
*  You know what?
*  Before gluten free, that wasn't it, right?
*  That's when Dana used to say, oh, it looks like you ate, Matt.
*  Sorry.
*  Fuck.
*  But yeah, that was me.
*  But I was so proud of her, man, because in front of my, she got out of the cage.
*  Longo is the one who greeted her at the fucking thing.
*  Cause I mean, look, she's fighting a purple belt from Virginia here.
*  And again, like she never did any kind of sports in high school.
*  I mean, if you see her standing up, like she's like doing a fucking clinic, man.
*  She snaps down.
*  She takes the back and, you know, she's a blue belt.
*  She fought a purple belt.
*  There was always that last, that, that chance of the girl, you know, doing something.
*  And you never know how these things go.
*  So she's one and done.
*  I'm happy she's done with it.
*  She did.
*  It's awesome.
*  It's nice for my daughters to see.
*  And now I'm saving myself from all the shit I said earlier about the fucking girls with
*  the fucking, I'm only kidding.
*  No, my wife, no, I'm just really proud of her.
*  It was really nice.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's cool.
*  What a crazy aspiration at that age just to say, fuck it.
*  Yeah, it's fucking crazy.
*  But I saw like clips of like your daughter helping her train.
*  What a cool like environment.
*  The whole setup with the school and all like he's like his family's part of it now.
*  And it happened naturally.
*  Organically.
*  Yeah.
*  He didn't like drag them in and say, I'll do this.
*  His girls were dancing and shit.
*  My oldest just left dance to like pursue it full time.
*  And now she's got like a jujitsu max net next month at the same place with my wife for it.
*  It's cool.
*  And she's on the Lou Negle.
*  You have an event.
*  It's cool.
*  And again, you can't, what I found with having a kid is you
*  can't make them love it, but you can make them hate it.
*  Like I never tried to be like, I used to always just play with them, play with them.
*  But now they're living at the school.
*  So cool.
*  It's so fucking crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Family business, you know.
*  Dean, have any new kids lately?
*  No.
*  I had no kids for me.
*  I got one.
*  Yeah, he's doing good though.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  College kid.
*  Shout out, Ethan.
*  So what are the other interesting fights on 300?
*  Mm.
*  Pull that shit up.
*  You got the BMF fight.
*  You got a Sean Wei Li versus Yan Xiaonan.
*  That should be wild.
*  Sean Wei Li is a monster.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Every time I'm at the PI, she's always there.
*  She's never not training when I'm there.
*  This is the dark horse, Olivera and Saryukian.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, let's talk about that.
*  What do you think about that?
*  That Saryukian dude is a dangerous motherfucker, but so is Olivera.
*  Olivera is the wildest turnaround of any fighter of all time.
*  At one point in time, he would fall short a lot.
*  He taps the strikes to Paul Felder, and then comes back and just knocks everybody out.
*  And just annihilates everyone, and has no fear.
*  A different human being was reborn inside of his body.
*  Because he was not known for it, but he was known to be able to break.
*  Yeah.
*  So if that's in him, it stays in him.
*  It hasn't been in him for a while.
*  No.
*  He's been smashing everybody.
*  I mean, he smashed Gachey.
*  He smashed...
*  Did he just fight Gachey?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  He beat Gachey.
*  He beat...
*  Who else did he beat?
*  He beat Chandler.
*  Chandler.
*  Look, that Chandler one was crazy, too, because he got hurt real bad in the first round.
*  He got dropped.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just also the power that he has is very unusual.
*  He loses to Makachev.
*  That's right.
*  He beat Poirier.
*  I mean, come on, son.
*  Gachey champion.
*  I fell for...
*  Beat Chandler, Poirier, and Gachey in a row.
*  I mean, that's wild.
*  I fell for Bonilla on that fight, man, because Bonilla was doing so...
*  Bonilla wasn't afraid to face him down there.
*  A lot of guys are afraid to go down there with him to the floor.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, rightfully so, because I just watched recently his fight with Kevin Lee again.
*  Yeah.
*  And Kevin Lee thought he'd be okay down there, and fuck, man.
*  You're fighting off one...
*  You're fighting to get out of an arm.
*  He's on your neck.
*  You're out of the neck.
*  He's on your leg.
*  That was the one when Kevin didn't realize he went out.
*  And he tapped.
*  He didn't realize he tapped.
*  I'm feeling...
*  I think that Armand's gonna take him...
*  I think he will take him down, and I wonder how that's gonna go.
*  That's what I'm waiting to see.
*  Very interesting fight.
*  If Charles is able to get on top of him, like Gamrot was able to control him on the ground...
*  But then look what he just did to Dariush.
*  Yeah.
*  Look what Armand just did to Beniche.
*  Benille.
*  Charles kind of whacked Benille too in the first round.
*  He did too.
*  Yeah, he did too.
*  Yeah, that's an interesting fight.
*  Isn't it crazy that you got Bo Nicol, who's only had how many MMA fights?
*  Four, five?
*  Maybe.
*  And he's on the main card.
*  I mean, here's my thing with him, man.
*  I think he's gonna be great.
*  I think he's gonna be a great fighter.
*  For sure.
*  I don't like how he talks about already accomplished fighters who've been through it.
*  What does he say?
*  Like, I mean, he's always talking about, oh, me and Coms not will be an easy fight.
*  I'm like, dude, like you got four fights and you got help with those fights.
*  And we haven't seen you get stuck on your feet.
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, but the thing is, like, even his opponents, like, you know, Jamie
*  Pickett, like even Cody Brunch, Cody Brunch is known to fold in fights.
*  Like, he's fighting guys that are folding.
*  Yeah, well, maybe they see a future champion in the fight.
*  I get it, but what I'm saying is...
*  I think they're trying to bring him along.
*  But I mean, you could bring him along, but don't, if you're in that position, don't talk
*  about guys that had to go through it.
*  I hear you.
*  But isn't it interesting?
*  I hear you.
*  But isn't it interesting that some fighters they decide to bring along?
*  Yeah.
*  And others are victims of their success.
*  Look what's on the undercard.
*  Yuri Pro...
*  Oh, Holly Holm.
*  Calvin, look at this.
*  This is the undercard Prohoska versus Rakeage.
*  That's wild as it is.
*  Wild, wild fight.
*  Calvin Cader and Aljo.
*  Holly Holm and Kayla Harrison.
*  Let's talk about that.
*  What do you think of that?
*  I don't know.
*  Can she make the weight?
*  I like Holly.
*  What was she fighting at?
*  155.
*  There's no way she doesn't make the weight.
*  She's a complete professional, but how she performs is going to be tough.
*  I just think Diego Lopez, bro.
*  That dude is a killer.
*  Yeah, he's a savage.
*  That's a future world champion caliber fighter.
*  No doubt about that.
*  Straight up killer.
*  Sadiq, he's fought for me back in the day on the Shogun.
*  Excellent.
*  That's a good fight.
*  Jalen Turner and Hanato Morikano.
*  That's another good fight.
*  All of these other fights that aren't on the main card.
*  Jim Miller.
*  Listen to Jim Miller.
*  Jim Miller.
*  Animal, right?
*  Davidson Figurado with Cody Garbrandt.
*  That opens up the fights.
*  That's crazy.
*  That is the craziest card of all time.
*  That's the first fight on the prelims.
*  That is the craziest card of all time in human history.
*  I was shocked when I saw that was the first prelim fight.
*  This fucking card is bananas, man.
*  Scroll up a little bit more, Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  To the main.
*  Yeah.
*  The prelim, just the bottom of it.
*  So.
*  I mean, that is wild, dude.
*  That is a wild undercard.
*  Whoo.
*  Yeah, that Turner and Morikano is gonna be a good one.
*  How do you think Holly's gonna be able to deal with that grappling and the physical strength?
*  Like, Kayla is a monster.
*  I mean, like, we already saw her do it with Rhonda.
*  Why?
*  She's as big.
*  I think Rhonda's a better grappler than Kayla on the ground,
*  transitioning to submissions and things.
*  I just watched Kayla fight Aspen Ladd and look like dog shit, personally.
*  One of my guys won the PFL card and she struggled.
*  She got swept against that girl and stuff.
*  So I don't think Holly can grapple with her for sure,
*  but I don't think Holly's gonna be so easy to take down because
*  she requires the clinch to get her down.
*  And Holly's a big, strong chick.
*  I mean, I know she's 42 now, so maybe the age becomes a factor.
*  But if she can just keep range, she's gonna win on her feet.
*  So I mean, I have to see Kayla take her down.
*  I just don't think it's gonna be so easy.
*  And if Holly doesn't feel a threat on her feet, Holly might start lighting her up.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I seen Kayla fight.
*  I don't know who the girl was, but I don't think she...
*  The Brazilian girl shut her down.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  A Brazilian.
*  That's who it was.
*  She didn't do shit with her on the floor.
*  She didn't do shit with her.
*  Yeah.
*  And right here, she's fighting a soccer mom.
*  Right.
*  If you back up before that...
*  Oh, it's Aspen Ladd.
*  I'm sorry, Aspen Ladd.
*  I'm sorry.
*  I didn't know it was Aspen Ladd.
*  But if you look at the way she's throwing punches on her feet...
*  She's gonna stick a German Shepard's on me.
*  It's not good.
*  It's not...
*  She's not a striker.
*  She wants this.
*  But in these grappling exchanges, she's gonna be a fucking handful.
*  Well, this is why...
*  I mean, this is where I'm kind of excited.
*  But we don't know how to wait.
*  It's gonna affect her.
*  Well, if she did it right, it might actually help.
*  Probably help her gas tank tremendously.
*  Like in this fight, she never put her in danger.
*  Never put her in danger.
*  It really just depends on how much muscle she loses.
*  And how much strength training she continues to do.
*  You don't get that big without a lot of strength training.
*  Holly's got a lot of experience.
*  I mean, a lot of it is, of course, judo, right?
*  She's got bigger arms than Raulo.
*  She's a tank.
*  But that comes at a requirement.
*  There's a lot of oxygen gets sucked up by those.
*  That's what's interesting when you watch guys get older
*  and they get more economical like Yoel.
*  Got way more economical about how and when to move.
*  But put guys to sleep because they forgot that he could just explode on you.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And the wyman.
*  The wyman, the flying knee.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  He would just jump on dudes.
*  And you didn't expect it coming.
*  It's like, you know...
*  Because he would chill and just sit back, sit back, sit back.
*  And be so relaxed.
*  I love you.
*  Yeah, I love you.
*  That's funny.
*  They really, not to bring that up,
*  but they really fucked Tim Kennedy back in the day for that.
*  Oh, they did.
*  Fucked him.
*  Tim Kennedy won that fight.
*  That was fucked up.
*  That was crazy.
*  That was fucked up.
*  That was crazy.
*  There was like an extra, how many seconds?
*  My man was on that.
*  39 seconds.
*  He stayed on that stool for like a whole round.
*  Tim had him.
*  That's a rough one to do.
*  And then there's the mental break that comes from thinking that you won
*  because the guy's not getting off the stool and then you got to fight again.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And then Yoel caught him.
*  The thing about Yoel is he can catch anybody.
*  He can catch anybody.
*  Remember when he caught Machida?
*  The Machida knockout was terrifying.
*  He felt like a superhero.
*  Bro, it's like everybody else is a child.
*  Yeah, when he gets going.
*  Yeah, everybody else is like a child.
*  Is this the end of the fight?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I wanted to see when Tim was winning.
*  I mean, come on, man.
*  This is some bullshit.
*  Which one?
*  So this is it right here.
*  So Tim Kennedy, he's got him hurt there.
*  Boom, he's got him hurt.
*  Bad.
*  And then the bell rings.
*  So he goes back.
*  I mean, Yoel's on the verge of going out.
*  Like, look, he goes back.
*  But they gave him all this extra time.
*  The round was supposed to start.
*  He's still sitting on the stool.
*  What is Big John doing?
*  They covered him with like water or ice and they have too much vaseline on his face.
*  There's a bunch of different things.
*  And he just laid there.
*  But then he eventually caught Tim.
*  That's rough, man.
*  Oh, man.
*  That's some bullshit.
*  Well, it sucks.
*  That's for sure.
*  Sucks for Tim because in all fairness, I think when the bell starts, if you're not willing
*  or able to get up and that should be it.
*  Yeah, that should be it.
*  Yeah.
*  No doubt about that.
*  If you're not able to answer the bell.
*  But I think there was something else going on.
*  Like he was covered in something.
*  They had to wipe him off.
*  There was like some shenanigans.
*  And there was ice on the ground too.
*  I think they did all that shit on purpose.
*  On purpose.
*  All that shit on purpose.
*  Bind time.
*  Old school shit.
*  Angelo did that.
*  Angelo Dundee did that with Muhammad Ali back when he was Cassius Clay.
*  And he fought this dude in London.
*  No, he fought this.
*  I don't know if it was in London.
*  It was Henry Cooper.
*  Henry Cooper was this badass British dude who had a nasty left hook.
*  And he caught Cassius Clay with a perfect left hook.
*  Just bang, boom, dropped him.
*  And it was at the end of the round.
*  And they cut his gloves in between rounds.
*  They had to give him new gloves.
*  They gave him plenty of time.
*  So this was after the fight.
*  They're yelling at each other.
*  Well, Tim was yelling at him.
*  That's good.
*  If you can't get off the stool, let's end the fight.
*  LeBore is such a nice guy too.
*  He's right though.
*  He's right.
*  He's 100% right.
*  He's right.
*  But I think, like I said, I think there's a bunch of shenanigans that were involved.
*  I think there's too much Vaseline on him.
*  I think there was water all over him.
*  But there's a bunch of shit where they did a bunch of things to make sure that the round got extended.
*  How was the dirty business?
*  Speaking of dirty business, how's the, now that you saw it has gone, how's this new testing thing?
*  Well, Walt Harris just got popped, right?
*  Oh, they're four years.
*  That's a death sentence right there.
*  That's a crazy one.
*  Yeah, you're done.
*  Yeah, Walt's already 40.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  And he got popped, allegedly, I should say, from what the report was that I read on one of the websites.
*  It was like three different things, three different times.
*  John, when you're 40, the shit doesn't work so good.
*  Right.
*  You gotta need it.
*  Yeah, on the natch.
*  Yeah, it's kind of weird.
*  Like, we know this stuff really works, but you're not allowed to use it.
*  48-month sanction for two separate violations of the UFC anti-doping policy.
*  First test positive.
*  What is that?
*  Tell me what that is.
*  No, Rallo.
*  Rallo knows what it is.
*  Where is it?
*  Draw stand-alone.
*  What is that?
*  Fuck all you guys.
*  I just think you're good at those words.
*  Metabolite 3A, hydroxy 2A, methyl 5A, androstan 17-on, and testosterone of exogenous origin.
*  And samples collected on June 24, 2023, July 12, 2023.
*  Harris was notified of the first adverse finding on July 11 of 2012.
*  So they told him that he got popped the first time, and then he tested positive the next day.
*  Yeah, subsequently, after he's notified of the adverse finding, he provided urine and
*  blood samples on August 6, 2023.
*  Urine sample tested positive for the presence of anastrazolone, a prohibitive substance that
*  was not present in any of the previous samples, as well as drostanolone and its metabolite.
*  Blood samples tested positive for the presence of exogenous testosterone, which based on its
*  values was determined as a new administration since the notification of his first adverse
*  findings on July 11.
*  So he wasn't taking the test that day.
*  Wow.
*  Four years.
*  That's a life sentence.
*  And how old is he now?
*  40.
*  He was supposed to fight like four days after that.
*  It seems kind of crazy that he would just take all that stuff knowing that they were
*  going to catch him.
*  Have you ever asked Novitskiy why they made BPC 157 illegal?
*  It's not a performance enhancer.
*  Because some state regulators, like, you know, athletic commissions, they have it illegal.
*  So if the UFC allows something that the athletic commissions don't allow, it really should be
*  allowed by the athletic commissions.
*  100%.
*  It's all it's doing is helping people heal from injuries.
*  So that's all it is?
*  So it's like the states are...
*  And it's a naturally occurring compound in the human body.
*  It's an amino acid.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's something that should be legal.
*  And, you know, I think the FDA is trying to stop its use now, too, which is crazy.
*  Anything that works.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Well, listen, you fuckheads, just sell it to us.
*  Just fucking sell it.
*  Don't be stupid.
*  There's a lot of money to be made.
*  I'll help you.
*  Just fucking make it legal and sell it.
*  It's good.
*  It's really good for injuries.
*  Really good for injuries.
*  100%.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a bunch of stuff like that that should be legal.
*  The testosterone one, those boys went wild and they fucked it up for everybody.
*  The TRT Vitor era.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Those boys went wild.
*  TRT TOR, as they used to call them?
*  Those boys went wild.
*  TRT Vitor.
*  It's true, though.
*  Take testosterone replacement, everybody's like, oh, I definitely have low testosterone.
*  Hook it up.
*  Eric Silva, he was another one that really noticeably changed.
*  Oh, a lot of dudes did.
*  Bro, we had guys that were 25 years old that were signing up for testosterone use exemptions.
*  That's going to fuck them up when they're older, though.
*  100%.
*  But that was the thing.
*  A lot of those guys were already fucked up because they did juice.
*  So if you're a young guy and you do a bunch of cycles of juice and you get Gigantor,
*  that is going to jack up your system.
*  It takes a long time to recover.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's dudes that are like 25 years old that have wrecked their endocrine system.
*  And they probably can't have kids.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They have low sperm count.
*  Yeah.
*  It can fuck you up.
*  You see these social media kids that are like 18, 19 years old.
*  And then also when they're 22, they've gained 80 pounds of muscle and they have zits all over
*  their back and they're fucking huge.
*  And they're getting all this attention because they're massive.
*  And there's quite a few of these kids.
*  They're going to ruin their body.
*  They're going to ruin their endocrine system.
*  They're going to...
*  You're shocking your system at a very, very young age.
*  When you're on TOT, it's like fucking birth control for men.
*  I have been pulled out in years, son.
*  I was fucking pulled out.
*  And I was able to...
*  I could have a kid.
*  When I want to have a kid, I don't know if it's because I go commando forever,
*  I'd have a kid.
*  I want to get pregnant, my guy.
*  You know, it worked.
*  So I know we were good to go.
*  But ever since I'm on TOT...
*  Isn't it funny?
*  Because the other idea for a male birth control is the opposite.
*  There's a male birth control pill that came out that radically lowers testosterone levels.
*  Fuck that.
*  But how many...
*  Hold on, why would you take that?
*  How many...
*  So good, fuck your life.
*  How many...
*  Cucks for sure.
*  ...dominant women who have cuck men are going to force them to take that stuff.
*  Slipping that shit in their oatmeal.
*  No, no, no. Force them.
*  Oh my God.
*  Force them to take it.
*  Yeah, no.
*  Force them.
*  None of that.
*  No.
*  Why would anybody take that?
*  Because they don't want that as the wife.
*  They want the alpha.
*  Yeah, but they want to do that to the guy.
*  Some women like doing that.
*  Off control.
*  They like doing that.
*  To curb him?
*  Yeah.
*  They'll turn you trans.
*  They'll do whatever they want to you.
*  They'll drain your bank account, leave you broken.
*  Bye.
*  Turn you trans.
*  Screw that.
*  Yeah, they'll make you.
*  It's just, there's certain people...
*  It's like your Kardashian skit.
*  Yeah, you gotta wonder, man,
*  trying to be like a young kid in this day and age with social media,
*  trying to be an 18, 19 year old kid trying to fan your way through life,
*  seeing these juiced up gigantic dudes getting attention,
*  girls with lip fillers at 18 years old, and everybody's got a Ferrari.
*  It's harder for them than it was for us, right?
*  Because of social media?
*  Way harder.
*  It's way harder because there's so much chaos out there.
*  Like the guy getting shot in the dick.
*  You see things all the time that were really hard to see when we were kids.
*  Because I only knew motherfuckers in my neighborhood.
*  That was it?
*  No, no, no.
*  It's just in general.
*  You only hung out with people in your neighborhood.
*  That was it.
*  And if you saw someone on TV that was in an MTV music video or something like that,
*  but that's not even real world.
*  That's not the real world.
*  But if it's some guy you know from your school,
*  now has a million followers on TikTok, what?
*  You made $100,000.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  How?
*  What are you doing?
*  I don't know, man.
*  Maybe because I got my kids homeschooled ever since the pandemic,
*  because we didn't want them wearing masks and all that shit.
*  My wife's lucky enough that we're lucky enough she gets to be a stay-at-home mom and whatnot.
*  Oh, I got ADD.
*  What were we just?
*  Kids shooting people in the dicks.
*  People being able to see things that they never could see when we were kids.
*  Kids are homeschooled.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  This is what I'm sorry.
*  I'm back.
*  It was the Zin's kicking in.
*  It was, you know, we keep them close.
*  Like nowadays, if they go to school all day,
*  one, what the fuck are they telling these kids is weird enough.
*  And from my other friend's kid came home the other day.
*  He's like, he's like, oh, man, he's 10 years old.
*  He's like, oh, dad, so when I grow up, I could be a boy or a girl.
*  It's fucking, and my buddy's like a religious guy.
*  He's like, ah, fuck.
*  He moved to South Carolina.
*  He got the fuck out of Long Island.
*  But so I don't know where it is in different school systems,
*  but I didn't like stuff like that.
*  It's not like when we were kids at school.
*  Stuff is so weird.
*  It's fucking strange.
*  But it just shows you that whatever is socially popular,
*  people will gravitate to and that people will change their behavior
*  based on what gets them more attention.
*  That's why I'm saying like, because some of them are definitely trans.
*  That shit's existed since the beginning of time.
*  A man who feel like they were born in a woman's body.
*  But some of them are getting sucked into a social contagious.
*  The majority of them, they think it's cool to be bi or it's, oh, what are you?
*  I'm, dude, it's fucking, it's just fucking weird.
*  And if you want to be, you got to suck a dick,
*  whether it's a transgender dick or a regular dick.
*  You got to experiment, suck a dick if you want some street cred.
*  No, I want to.
*  No street cred.
*  That's what I think today.
*  They've gone to places where 50% of the kids identify as LBALGBTQ.
*  50%.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, 50%.
*  Yeah, 50%.
*  That's a joke.
*  But don't you think that's a-
*  If they're not being indoctrinated, then this never happens.
*  Well, it's just fascinating that it's-
*  The shit didn't happen by accident.
*  It's fascinating that it's working.
*  That's what's fascinating.
*  And when you look at the people, like, look,
*  if you're going to pay someone 35 grand a year to take care of your kids,
*  they're not going to be good people that are, like,
*  dominant in their field and really on the ball.
*  You're going to get wacky people teaching kids.
*  And a lot of these people that are teaching kids in public schools
*  that you see making these TikTok videos,
*  they're wacky people that just happen to be in the position
*  where they're running a school.
*  As a parent, though, I think you should just keep them close
*  and just talk to them every day.
*  Yeah, you definitely need to talk to them,
*  but they're going to have to talk to other people too.
*  And there's something about running into really cuckoo people
*  when you're young that's probably good for you,
*  just so you know that they exist.
*  The problem is if they have too much influence over your kid
*  and your kid starts believing things that they're saying
*  and they indoctrinate you into some weird way of thinking
*  that maybe you don't align with in your home
*  and you don't want your child being raised that way,
*  which is your prerogative, like, as a person.
*  But also the kids should be exposed to a lot of weird shit.
*  It's like it's good for them to see cuckoo people.
*  I think that's where me and Matt have a benefit,
*  because we're the cuckoo people that our kids see.
*  Yeah, we all are, right? There's no way to avoid that.
*  But I don't ever remember.
*  If you're interested in what we're interested in.
*  It's true, right?
*  I always preference things with people asking my opinions.
*  Like, listen, I'm a dirty comedian
*  and a cage fighting commentator.
*  So with that said, this is my dumb ass perspective.
*  But understand who the fuck you're talking to.
*  Loosely educate it at best.
*  Think about that dirty comedian and you commentate fights.
*  That's a perspective.
*  Yeah, that's a person of questionable judgment.
*  It's true.
*  Highly unnormal.
*  Communication is everything, though.
*  I don't remember my parents talking to me.
*  My kid's 15 now.
*  When I was 15, I was sleeping over at Jimmy's house.
*  I'd be walking the fucking streets, fighting and doing stuff.
*  I'm 15. I can't think of it.
*  My kid, I never not know where she is.
*  I think it was a different time, Matt.
*  I think their parents raised them in a different way.
*  It takes a while to understand why your parents raised you
*  the way they raised you.
*  But it's because the way they were raised and the way the people...
*  Look, my grandparents were straight up immigrants from Italy and from Ireland.
*  They're all people from the boat and those were wild people.
*  Those people that took a chance and got on that fucking boat
*  and made it across the ocean.
*  And my mother.
*  Yeah, a bunch of wild people.
*  And they didn't have a whole lot of time for parenting.
*  Yeah.
*  And then their kids grew up and had kids and then their kids had kids.
*  It's like it takes a while for everybody to settle down.
*  I think people are...
*  We have way more information today than ever before,
*  which is probably good for kids.
*  It's good to be aware of all the different types of humans
*  and all the different possibilities of good and bad things
*  that can happen in the world.
*  But also, it's got to be overwhelming, man.
*  It's got to be overwhelming to be a kid
*  and to think you got to worry about climate change and Ukraine and Russia
*  and fucking Mexicans.
*  It's just every day, it's something new.
*  Well, that's the thing.
*  The phone puts it in their face all day every day.
*  Every day, it's something new.
*  We didn't have any of that shit.
*  Biden falling down a flight of stairs,
*  Trump calling somebody a pussy.
*  Yeah.
*  It's every day.
*  It's like this is crazy.
*  Life is fun now.
*  It is definitely fun if you're an adult.
*  If you're an adult and you're not being affected negatively by it.
*  Well, because we, like you said, we come up from a different generation.
*  We didn't grow up doing that.
*  Right.
*  So we can live without it.
*  We're also, all of us are in wild businesses.
*  You're in the business of people beating the shit out of each other.
*  You know, this is a wild business.
*  It's a wild business.
*  It's funny that it is where it is now.
*  I remember coming up, we were talking about before being OGs,
*  like I remember each fight thinking, all right, this might be the last one
*  and it's going to be done.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So now it's just such a mainstream thing.
*  It's crazy.
*  I remember very clearly Eddie Bravo and I were having a conversation
*  and it's almost like we manifested this.
*  We said, dude, we know MMA is awesome.
*  Wouldn't it be crazy if just some fucking billionaire dudes
*  who were fans of the sport just dumped a bunch of money in it
*  just to show everybody and then it would just catch on.
*  I was like, if somebody just came along, that would work, man.
*  That's the only way it would work.
*  Somebody would have to lose tons and tons of money just to get it out there.
*  And that's what they did.
*  It's literally like it was manifested.
*  Lorenzo and Frank Petita.
*  Yeah, it's amazing.
*  And they just really loved it.
*  They loved it.
*  They trained.
*  They were tough guys.
*  They loved it.
*  They lost like 50, 60 million.
*  They were down.
*  Money, that's how much they loved it.
*  They were down more than 40 million when the first Ultimate Fighter came around.
*  And they funded that whole thing.
*  They funded the whole thing.
*  They just rolled the dice and came up double six.
*  For real?
*  Yeah, when you think about like the chain of events that had to have to happen.
*  That made it.
*  Like the Fertitas, then the forest fight, and then just everything that happened.
*  You have to have a guy like Dana.
*  You have to have a complete maniac running the show.
*  You have to have a guy like that.
*  People don't understand how much of a maniac he is.
*  In psycho in terms of like his work ethic.
*  Oh, he's a maniac.
*  That's pretty obvious.
*  The guy works constantly.
*  He loves it.
*  He loves setting fights up.
*  We'll talk at two o'clock in the morning for like hours just about matchups and shit.
*  Did you see the other day on the podcast when the girl's the lady?
*  Yes.
*  She's like, tell me, what does Joe Rogan think of whatever it was?
*  And he's like, what does Joe Rogan think?
*  She goes, Dana White.
*  He goes, wait, you think I'm Joe Rogan?
*  He goes, I came in to do this podcast.
*  You know that's UFC events, like the weeks of the events or when I'm looking for a fight.
*  You've been there.
*  Oh, man.
*  I have a picture of this and that.
*  I'm like, oh, well, all right, sure.
*  And then, you know, thanks a lot, Mr. White.
*  They always think he's either Joe or Dana.
*  People call me Dana.
*  I've been called Dana before.
*  So I'm doing, it's old Dana.
*  I go, no, I'm the other dude.
*  The hell is this?
*  It happens all the time.
*  But I think she just made a mental flop.
*  Trying to say all bald white guys look alike.
*  When you're doing a podcast and you're interviewing someone, especially if you haven't
*  done a lot of them and it's a high profile thing, you're doing Dana White,
*  you're always thinking of what to say.
*  Even the question is like, what's your dream?
*  You know, that's a crazy question.
*  That's like, I don't know what to ask you.
*  So she's probably floundering a little bit there and doesn't know what to say.
*  It's fucking weird having a conversation with someone.
*  But I think he handled it the right way by making fun of it.
*  Yeah.
*  She handled it the right way too.
*  She kept it in there.
*  She didn't edit it out.
*  Yeah.
*  It's funny.
*  Yeah, it is funny.
*  It's funny.
*  It's just a flop.
*  I've done it all the time.
*  It happens.
*  It wouldn't have been funny if they called fucking Dean Thomas Pete Spratt or something.
*  Somebody called you Pete Spratt?
*  They used to always do that.
*  Oh, just for fun.
*  Yeah, just for fun.
*  Just for fun.
*  Or the one time on Looking for a Fight, Habib really thought I was Eve.
*  That's what it is.
*  He's like, you knocked out my teammate.
*  I'm like, what are you talking about?
*  He's like, Josh Thompson.
*  I was like, no, man, that was Eve.
*  Isn't it wild how Habib just said, nope, done, see ya, bye.
*  Promise my mom, I'm done.
*  I mean, when you're that good and your life is-
*  Pretty incredible though.
*  What a legacy, right?
*  Undefeated.
*  Only one fight was kind of close, the Gleason-Teebaugh fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Go back and watch that one.
*  I thought Gleason might have won that one.
*  It was arguable.
*  If they gave it to him, nobody would protest.
*  It was close.
*  Pre-usada.
*  Pre-usada.
*  Oh, the Gleason pre-usada?
*  Yeah.
*  My man Gleason built like a fucking superhero.
*  Like a fucking teletubbie on steroids.
*  That was a fucking bro.
*  Gleason-Teebaugh.
*  Oh, those Shawn Shirk days, son.
*  Yeah.
*  The muscle shark.
*  Bro, remember Shirk?
*  Shirk was a little fucking demon.
*  He was a little fire plug.
*  Demon.
*  Shirk was one of the first guys that had preposterous strength and conditioning.
*  Him and Rich Franklin.
*  They would do these.
*  Look at his stride.
*  Look at his Brazilian human.
*  Bro, look at his biceps.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  The thing about Gleason that always used to freak me out was the fact that he could make 155.
*  I know.
*  I was like, how?
*  Because I would stand next to him.
*  I'm like, you're so much bigger than me.
*  How the fuck are you 155?
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  And Gleason got him down in this one, didn't he?
*  A couple times.
*  Gleason, he hurt him on the feet.
*  Quite a few.
*  Gleason was a dangerous fighter, man.
*  What happened to Gleason?
*  Well, you know, he got older, had a lot of wars.
*  You know, he got a, he did, um, didn't Islam KO him?
*  Islam KO'd him, yeah.
*  Islam KO'd him bad.
*  It was a bad one.
*  He's had a few KO losses.
*  He's a tough dude, though.
*  Yeah, and he fought, I think, a few times in PFO or something.
*  But they're going to war.
*  Wow.
*  Gleason was a house, though.
*  Man, I think the thing is, Habib looks natural and he looks fucking.
*  But look, like, he can't take Gleason down, which is crazy.
*  That's how strong Gleason was.
*  I mean, Khabib takes everybody down.
*  But Khabib looks smaller then.
*  Yeah, he does.
*  Doesn't he?
*  Yeah, he does.
*  Physically, he's much smaller.
*  You look at him and now look at him against Conor.
*  Yeah, it's true.
*  Let's just look at this right now.
*  Pause this.
*  Now go to Khabib versus Conor.
*  Well, how old was he here?
*  He was probably like-
*  He looks young.
*  Well, he's young, one of the first fights in the UFC, but made a market improvement
*  in that department because he looked way stronger later in his career.
*  Like, when he fought Gagey, he looked way stronger.
*  Yeah.
*  Way stronger.
*  Developed that man strength.
*  Yeah.
*  Six years later, too.
*  Six years later, that's a big-
*  Yeah, look at him there.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  Come on, bro.
*  That's a different dude.
*  Look at the difference, man.
*  Oh, 100%.
*  Go back to that picture again.
*  Yeah, he's all smooth here.
*  Now go to another one, the other one that you just showed me.
*  Look at him, bro.
*  That's that man strength.
*  Yeah.
*  That's also I want to kill you motivation.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  Right?
*  I mean, he got in fucking shape for Conor.
*  When he's standing on top of him, punching him, let's talk now.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Let's talk now.
*  You know what?
*  I was surprised Conor didn't quit at that moment because he was getting his ass whooped.
*  I don't think Conor's ever going to do that.
*  Well, Conor did say to him, you know, it's just business or something.
*  And then he said something like, no, I didn't say that, but fucking-
*  He definitely did.
*  Yeah.
*  He gets a lot of fucking-
*  He was probably a little rattled.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it wasn't going his way.
*  He did win a round, but it seemed like it was a round that Khabib took off.
*  Yeah.
*  To keep him kind of coasted for a round and then got back on him again.
*  Khabib just knew how to wear you out, man.
*  That thousand yard stare the dudes would have when he grabbed ahold of him.
*  Like Edson Barboza, that's the best one.
*  Like Edson has his eyes like, oh my God.
*  Edson or Michael Johnson where he told them guys, oh my God.
*  I was going, please tap.
*  Please.
*  I was anticipating that spiral fracture that guys get when they don't tap to the Kimura.
*  I don't like that.
*  The Kimura is an ugly break.
*  It's a bad break.
*  Minotauro versus Frank Niaz, the ugliest example of that.
*  Don't be stubbing with that, man.
*  I saw it in the Jiu Jitsu tournament.
*  I don't like that.
*  Recently online, some kids snapped, his arm just goes limp.
*  It's horrible.
*  It's horrible.
*  And it happened quick too, man.
*  The guy just turned it.
*  He turned the corner.
*  It just popped right in his arm.
*  And he goes like this, backs up and oh, it's awful.
*  I had a guy the other day.
*  People fall asleep all the time.
*  You know what happens.
*  Our goal is to put someone to sleep or get a limb.
*  So sometimes if the guy's a little stubborn, usually it's like, ah, and they'll stop if
*  anything.
*  But with the choke, sometimes you don't know.
*  So the bread cutter, you know the bread cutter?
*  Fucking when the arm's down like this.
*  I love that fucking one.
*  It's so good.
*  One of my black belts, Gord, he went with this other guy.
*  Now this other guy is a strong fucking like Middle Eastern guy.
*  And he's dude, he's not in that quick tap club.
*  And it's not good because this is the second time he went out.
*  But this time when he goes out, I go over, you know, you pick up the legs.
*  So I go over to him and I always usually make a joke and like, you know, because they usually
*  come right back.
*  So I'm like, hey, I'm in your bedroom.
*  Hey, remember I slept over, you know, and he's looking at me, dude.
*  In 30 years, I never seen one like this because I don't know how long this guy had him out.
*  His eyes were open.
*  He looked like a fucking zombie.
*  He's got my wrist.
*  He's going, oh, I'm like, wow.
*  His eyes were like he was out.
*  But he might have been out for a while and he had my wrist.
*  How long I thought it was you fucking grabbing me.
*  I go, hey, dude, I had me on belly on him.
*  I'm like, fuck it.
*  Don't let go of his legs.
*  I didn't want him to move.
*  I was fucking it took him.
*  It actually was starting to scare me a little bit.
*  How long did it take before he came back?
*  It felt like fucking eternity.
*  It was a few seconds and his eyes would just open the whole time.
*  I'm like, dude, is this fucking what am I dealing with?
*  And then he then then he started and started to
*  the whole time he's clenching his teeth.
*  He's got my wrist and I go, dude, are you back?
*  Did you sign a waiver?
*  He was okay.
*  And then the best was that guy.
*  Gord's a big sweet of a guy.
*  He's like a half a hippie, you know, he looks like Kung Fu Panda is like,
*  he's like, oh, and he's been calling me later.
*  He goes, you know, I haven't seen Syed since.
*  Is he all right?
*  He goes, come to think of it, nobody's seen this motherfucker.
*  I go, Sue, check up on this guy.
*  My girl check up on him and he came back the next day.
*  He was fucking fine.
*  Nobody's seen him.
*  I go, he's a little embarrassed.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  Go listen.
*  Then I found out it was like the second time he went out.
*  I go, dude, you can't.
*  I go, this is a tap.
*  You got it.
*  I go and I go, Hensel to listen.
*  It happens once in a while.
*  Like it happened to me once.
*  I don't know if it ever happened to you guys.
*  You ever get put to sleep?
*  I never got put to sleep.
*  I was a purple belt in the city and I was going with this other purple belt.
*  I didn't even like this guy.
*  This guy's a little prick.
*  I'll tell you his name.
*  I don't want to do any street cred.
*  Right?
*  He was a purple from Pennsylvania.
*  Never liked them.
*  I would always best them, but he was just like a dicky dude.
*  So he was trying to fucking and he was not bad at Jiu Jitsu.
*  So he's in my guard trying to strangle me.
*  Amateur move, you know, feet in the hips, flipped them over,
*  mounted them, fell asleep.
*  Motherfucker had it on still, you know, so I'm like, what the fuck?
*  Hensel like woke me up.
*  He didn't want to make a scene.
*  He goes, no, no, he's okay.
*  So then the guy went back after me and I woke up like during it.
*  I'm like, what the fuck?
*  And then I kind of then I realized what's going on.
*  I fucked them up.
*  But I remember after we went away.
*  So they didn't stop the match?
*  No, no, it was during the whole night of rolling.
*  It was just a training on a whatever night was back to the Gracie Kukak days on
*  crazy, great Kukak days.
*  I could cook.
*  Yeah, he's the guy that they had those videotapes, right?
*  I learned Jiu Jitsu from him.
*  I learned a solid amount of skating.
*  He was my first instructor.
*  I got my blue belt on the crack.
*  Craig came to New York, New Jersey first and Hensel came two years later.
*  And then later on, they ended up having a split and Hensel came to me.
*  You know, where'd that Kukak guy go?
*  Idaho or something.
*  He was a thing is in Idaho.
*  He was a very good instructor.
*  He was on the Horean and hoist.
*  And then they disowned him for some business reasons.
*  You know how weird?
*  When I seen shit like that, I had like a newsletter of the Gracie newsletter.
*  That's like a 17 year old.
*  Like I because my father was a martial artist and this is before, you know,
*  Black Belt magazine days, you know.
*  So I'm like, wait, so then I found out they did something at Black Belt where he was going
*  to be in New Jersey doing one day a week in Manhattan at Oishi's Judo club down in the
*  village over there.
*  So I go, I got to take advantage of this.
*  You know, like I didn't know.
*  I knew they kicked him out, but I knew they already awarded him.
*  So there he is.
*  Big German guy.
*  He was very good teacher.
*  Like, so my, my foundation is, is how long ago is this?
*  Jamie, does it say down there?
*  11 year old, 992.
*  Oh, the videos from 92.
*  The video was reuploaded and remastered 11 years ago.
*  It could be from this is very old.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It was a DVD.
*  So it wouldn't be a video.
*  Interesting.
*  And it's funny because when he started training, he didn't like the gear.
*  He's like, I don't even own a gig.
*  He forget he's that guy, but he was a very good teacher.
*  He learned on the Horean on hoist.
*  But the problem was he wasn't a very personable guy.
*  Like he was like, you could never get too close to the guy and him and Hanzo had like
*  a fallen out business wise.
*  And I was almost, I felt I was a young kid at the time.
*  So I remember Hanzo took me out to eat afterwards and he goes, look, one day after training and
*  he told me, he goes, look, now that I got my green coat, I'm getting away from this
*  motherfucker.
*  And he goes, I want he goes, if you go with him, because I was one of the guys tried to
*  kind of cock block his green card.
*  He was he was good.
*  And then I remember Hanzo going like, if you go with him, some guys will go just because
*  of you.
*  Nobody likes this motherfucker.
*  Hanzo goes, if you go with him and he goes, but I want you to come with me and this and
*  that I go wasn't even a choice.
*  Hanzo was like family, even though I'm a loyal guy.
*  I felt like parents were breaking up a little bit, but like, but Hanzo is Hanzo's gem.
*  Yeah, he is.
*  Fucking best.
*  I want him to run for president.
*  He can't.
*  I want him to run for president.
*  Hanzo for president.
*  You can't have Brazilian citizens running for president in America, unfortunately.
*  He's a great he's a great human being.
*  Isn't that kind of weird?
*  You could live here, but you can't run it.
*  We sort of make sure we don't get some foreign infiltrators.
*  It's like some old school espionage shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Like some of the someone takes their child across.
*  This is going to be the next president.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  To destroy the world.
*  He's the best.
*  No, I mean, Hanzo like just, you know, he's just such a great human being.
*  You know, he's done so much for me.
*  So I was the best.
*  Yeah, it wasn't even everybody loves Hanzo.
*  I don't.
*  Yeah, I've never met anybody who doesn't.
*  It's true.
*  And the thing about Hanzo is that it looks nice as fucking guy there is.
*  Yeah, no, he's the best.
*  He'll switch it in a heartbeat.
*  How to drop a dog.
*  And I'm fucking jump on somebody in a fucking hand.
*  He's like, yeah, well, listen, he was in a really quick.
*  He was with his son, who Ron, who's a sweet kid.
*  And he told this story on my podcast, but I'll do I'll try to do it justice.
*  They were in.
*  He's the best.
*  They pulled into a gas station, right?
*  And he was in a little sports car that he was given to his son, Horan.
*  And then somebody there was some guys, some like some street guys go there.
*  You know, that's a chick's car, something like that.
*  Right.
*  And he saw like his son's face, like get a little sad.
*  So he gets out.
*  He goes, hey, come see the size of my vagina.
*  He's like, hey, this is what you talk about.
*  And he's like, oh, hey, no, no, no, no.
*  Hens was a fucking nut.
*  He's always getting some drama to give a fuck man.
*  And like, my first shoot fighting match, like I, I, my first time ever fighting in a cage was
*  at Big Dan.
*  You know, Big Dan, the ref, he used to have a shoot fighting matches.
*  I remember that is school in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Bama fight nights or something like
*  that.
*  My first time ever as a purple belt, first time ever doing any kind of combat, you know,
*  I did a jujitsu tournament, but I never fought before.
*  So he came and it was like a three week notice thing, but I was always in shape.
*  So I asked Hensel, you know, what do you do like the day of the fight?
*  I was a little nervous, you know, and I'm thinking the crazys with their diet and this
*  and that.
*  He goes, this is what you do.
*  You go to GMC, you get the Rippet Fuel.
*  Get one of those, you feel good all day.
*  So back then, there's the Fedra back then.
*  So I'm like, all right, Rippet Fuel, right?
*  I took one on backstage and stuff going on.
*  I'm a little nervous.
*  I took another one.
*  Oh, no.
*  Let me do one more.
*  I'm fucking, I don't know what this stuff is.
*  So I took like fucking three.
*  So I fought some kid from Virginia who was like a blue belt level or something.
*  And this was with Rope Excapes.
*  So I went out there fucking kind of like I am now.
*  So I fucking like all hyped up.
*  Boom, took him down.
*  Bah, real naked choke.
*  He grabs the rope.
*  So I get him in two seconds.
*  He gets out.
*  So I get a point, but then they started on.
*  So I started off, I take him down again.
*  He starts climbing up.
*  There's no striking on the floor, on the face.
*  So it goes the distance because I'm exhausted.
*  I got exhausted because of the fucking, my heart would stop.
*  Afterwards, I couldn't even walk back.
*  I'm like, dude, this fighting is exhausting.
*  Meanwhile, it's the fucking a Fedra.
*  After the fight, Bart Vowel, you know who Bart Vowel is?
*  He was one of the refs.
*  Somehow he knew Dan through the shoot fighting.
*  Him and Hensel was supposed to fight in this thing called the WE.
*  I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  One and done event that was like a UFC wannabe, but Hensel fought three times in one night.
*  And that guy fought for some Hawaiian guy and they both got injured.
*  He got out.
*  But he was a big, he looked like a big fucking.
*  He gave me my first cauliflower ear.
*  Oh, you do?
*  That's a bare knuckle mullet.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  It's like Rallo with a mullet.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you have a crazy mustache?
*  Yeah, crazy mustache.
*  So Bart Vowel, Hensel was in my corner.
*  So afterwards, he's a big dude.
*  Rallo, so you know.
*  He's like 50 or so.
*  So afterwards, you know, he saw there was like, you know, even though we went the distance,
*  I won because I got the choke.
*  So Bart Vowel was going like that.
*  Hensel jumps up on the table.
*  There he is.
*  Hensel thought he was going me and you.
*  Hensel thought he was calling Hensel.
*  Hensel went over there to fucking go jump on him.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, yeah, fuck yeah.
*  I mean, that's a, he was a big dude, man.
*  Oh, he was a massive dude.
*  And he was in the early, early days of bare knuckle MMA.
*  It was like something out of Fraggle Rock.
*  And that was where, I remember that event.
*  That's like Eric Paulson in Matt Hume.
*  Yeah.
*  James Waring.
*  Eric Paulson is a very good fighter.
*  A very good fighter.
*  But I mean, it was the same time frame.
*  James Waring, fucking schoolyard, he fucking wrapped his hair around, he's a boxer.
*  And Eric Paulson is a very complete fighter.
*  He's a very well-rounded, jikun no gai.
*  He'd fight over in Shudo.
*  But, well, I don't think they would know you're allowed to go back there.
*  I mean, he tried to go through the striking side with his grappling experience, Paulson.
*  What does that mean?
*  Like, they had two divisions.
*  It was grapplers and strikers.
*  Waring was in the striker side.
*  And then the end of it was the guy who won the striking side fought the guy who won the grappling side.
*  That's not right, though, because Henson fought a judoka.
*  I mean, they were still fighting, but it was, like, they had rules on how long you could be on the ground, all that shit.
*  Like, I remember.
*  He's cool, Mr. Waring, actually.
*  I met him down in Florida.
*  He's a pretty funny guy.
*  You ever see when Matt Hume fought Pat Miletich?
*  That was good.
*  That was a good fight.
*  That was a good fight.
*  Matt Hume was good, good.
*  He was very good.
*  Yeah, I remember I trained with him in Japan the first time I fought Uno.
*  And he beat the shit out of me.
*  I was like, man, I shouldn't even be here.
*  Mighty Mouse says he still beats his ass.
*  I'm sure.
*  And he's like 50.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  He's got to be older than 50, man.
*  I'm about to be 50.
*  He might be 60.
*  Matt Hume was good.
*  He was very good.
*  Yeah.
*  I was always fascinated that he didn't continue to fight.
*  Remember, he did contenders, too, where they had to grapple.
*  Like, the wrestlers versus the jiu-jitsu fighters.
*  Was it Kenny Monday?
*  Yeah, Kenny Monday tried to go for his legs.
*  Yeah.
*  They were like that.
*  And that was when Frank Shamrock.
*  Kevin Jackson?
*  Was in it?
*  No, no, no.
*  Kevin Jackson was in the UFC.
*  That was in the UFC.
*  Oh, that was in the UFC.
*  That was...
*  He healed.
*  Dan Henderson.
*  Was it Dan Henderson?
*  Yeah, Dan Henderson.
*  He caught him in like an ankle lock.
*  Was that when Bustamante fought Erickson?
*  No.
*  Or was that a different event?
*  Different event.
*  That was a different event.
*  That was an MMA event.
*  That was Mars.
*  Yeah, Mars.
*  Yeah.
*  He fought Tom Erickson for 45 minutes.
*  Murillo Bustamante and Fabio Gagel are two of some of my all-time favorites.
*  Me too.
*  Me too.
*  I thought when Bustamante tapped Matt Lindlin out twice.
*  Twice.
*  I remember that, yeah.
*  Because he tapped him out and Big John stopped the fight.
*  I thought Bustamante beat Chuck Liddell in that fight too.
*  Me too.
*  I thought he outstruck him.
*  I thought he won that fight.
*  Boy, I'd have to go back and watch that again.
*  Yeah, interesting.
*  Me too.
*  He was a beast.
*  He was so comfortable on the back.
*  Sometimes Chuck would do a punch and he'd go back with it.
*  The optics were a little weird.
*  Maybe.
*  But I think that guy...
*  What I love about those guys is that if you've seen those guys in Abu Dhabi, you've seen
*  them in a Jiu-Jitsu tournament, you've seen them in MMA.
*  They're Jiu-Jitsu transitions.
*  That's like...
*  Who did I just say earlier?
*  The young kid.
*  The young kid is younger than me, I guess.
*  Here's Bustamante and Chuck.
*  Here's Bustamante and Chuck right here.
*  And Bustamante was an 85er, right?
*  Yeah.
*  This is a crazy fight, if you think about it.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember he...
*  How many times did Bustamante fight 205?
*  He was pretty...
*  I mean, for a Jiu-Jitsu guy, he was pretty well-rounded, especially for that time.
*  For that time, for sure he was.
*  None of the guys would be on their feet.
*  He was awesome, real Bustamante.
*  And people sleep on Chuck.
*  Look at that.
*  I didn't realize Chuck was a wrestler.
*  That was a good right hand by Chuck, though.
*  Chuck had the touch of death.
*  Don't you...
*  That's what Chuck, when he hung in there too long...
*  I like when the guys...
*  What were we just talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  It's unfortunate that they don't have a fucking exit strategy, you know?
*  And then also, if you've had a bunch of wars, you're probably not thinking so good anymore.
*  It's hard to muster up the mental energy to create a new career.
*  It's hard to accept the fact that you ain't as good as you used to be.
*  Yes, very hard.
*  They don't accept it.
*  For a lot of guys, very hard.
*  When you're young, you don't think you're ever going to be old.
*  Fuck it.
*  Is it kind of wild that Fedor's still throwing?
*  Is he really?
*  Didn't he...
*  Did he retire finally in the Ryan Bader fight when he got knocked out the second time?
*  I thought he retired, but then I saw him talking about trying to do a boxing match with Tyson
*  or one of those guys.
*  That's what, man.
*  That dude in his prime was something different.
*  Fedor, for sure.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  We have to look at him in the context of what came before him.
*  And there was nobody like Fedor.
*  There was nothing like him before him, for sure.
*  The fact that he could both knock you out and hit submissions from everywhere, from
*  everywhere, off his back.
*  I mean, when Randleman threw him, remember that?
*  Spiked him on his head.
*  Spiked him on his head and his expression never changed.
*  His variety of just being able to do so many different things.
*  So many different things.
*  So tough.
*  And his personality.
*  That was fucking...
*  How he's throwing the podcast.
*  There's something about that personality.
*  And he fought a heavyweight when he could have fought a 205 forever.
*  He could have fought a 85.
*  How about that?
*  What was he about to do?
*  How old was he?
*  About 230 with that belly?
*  He always looked chubby.
*  Very accurate, man.
*  Who the fuck is he accurate?
*  His hand speed was pretty fucking good.
*  Phenomenal.
*  Yeah, I was with Jeff Munson in Russia when he fought Jeff.
*  And man, I'd never seen a beating like that.
*  And when Jeff was walking out, I mean, Jeff, yeah, he really looked like he was going to
*  his death.
*  I mean, it was bad.
*  That was Fedor when he was really Fedor.
*  The Fedor that fought in...
*  Remember when he walked down Cro Cop?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He walked up...
*  Beating him up.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Okay, Ryan Bader, he suffered a TKO in the first round, retiring from MMA after the bout.
*  So he says, but that was real recent.
*  That was February.
*  A year ago.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I mean, I think you could talk some of those guys...
*  I just think they just don't like not doing it.
*  Yeah.
*  The thrill of getting...
*  It just gives them a purpose.
*  As they get older, it gets more and more dangerous to get KO'd more often.
*  You would think Putin would make him the minister or something like he did with Correia and stuff.
*  Give him a job.
*  The problem is when you compete that long, I know the weirdest feeling for me, I don't
*  know how it was for you or any of you guys, you all competed, after the three month to
*  the six month mark of not getting another thing coming up, it's a fucking weird feeling.
*  It's like, should I be calling Joe Silver now and getting another fucking fight?
*  What am I...
*  Your purpose.
*  Yeah, yeah, it felt weird.
*  It felt weird in the beginning.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  People, they just can't accept...
*  And then if they go and do other stuff and they don't find success in that other thing,
*  then they get it all.
*  I could have just made 30,000 for a fight.
*  I could have done this, I could have done that.
*  And then you're watching other dudes make all this money and you think, damn, man, I
*  can still hang with them.
*  I still got it.
*  And then you got to get a real job.
*  There's also the difference between someone who's absolutely obsessed with being the best
*  in the world and someone who's thinking, I could probably fight and make money.
*  Because you're just not going to train, you're not going to focus, you're not going to have
*  the same intensity, enthusiasm, the same everything.
*  You're not going to be the same guy.
*  So even if you used to be that guy when you were younger, when you were 20, if you're
*  27 and you're just doing it for money and you think you're still that guy that you were
*  when you were 20, when you were obsessed with it, you're going to get fucked up.
*  You're going to get fucked up.
*  Things can go south so quickly too.
*  You could be on a tear and next thing you know, you're down two, you're down three.
*  Now what do you got?
*  Look at Volkanovsky.
*  Volkanovsky before the rematch with Islam Makachev is in dispute as the best pound for
*  pound fighter alive.
*  He almost won that fight, a very close fight.
*  Some people thought he could have won, some people thought Islam could have won, but either
*  way, he went up, fought the best fighter in the 155 pound division and got to a standstill
*  with him.
*  So at that point you're looking at him, this motherfucker is one of the greatest of all
*  time, probably the best pound for pound fighter alive.
*  And then he gets KO'd in the rematch he takes with 10 days notice, which is crazy to take
*  a fight like that with 10 days notice.
*  And then he gets KO'd in the fight with Toporya.
*  And in two fights over the course of, what was it, seven months, eight months?
*  Everything's different.
*  Everything's different.
*  Do you think his team did him a disservice running him out there right after, like that
*  was too soon after Makachev in my opinion, and if they let him run out there again in
*  three or four months, I think they're really doing him a disservice because the lights
*  been turned off twice and they got to give him his brain time.
*  Yeah, but is that really his team or that's just him?
*  You know, you can't tell the team shit.
*  You do have the final say.
*  Fighters always think they can do anything.
*  They always think they can do it.
*  They always think they can pull it off.
*  Because like you said, like, I mean, he pretty much at that weight might have been the best
*  guy ever.
*  When Manny Pacquiao got knocked out by Marquez, Freddie Roach said one year, you only take
*  a whole year off, you're not doing anything for a year.
*  It was one of the best one punch knockouts in the history of sport.
*  And Manny was piecing him up until that point.
*  And the consequences of the fight, you know, their third fight.
*  Yeah, hindsight's 20-20 though.
*  I mean, he could have went in there and fucking knocked him out.
*  I mean, what if he got that head kick?
*  That same head kick he compromised.
*  You're not going to be able to compete against a guy like Makachev with no camp.
*  You're not going to be the same guy.
*  This is my argument like with Kamaru Usman and Hamza.
*  And everyone's like, Hamza beat Kamaru.
*  I'm like, sort of, sort of, kind of.
*  Ten days notice.
*  Kamaru wins.
*  Yeah, because Kamaru was winning in the third.
*  Also, Kamaru didn't have time to prepare.
*  He doesn't know. He can't trust his gas tank.
*  So fighting up a weight class.
*  But Hamza was really legit at 170 if he could make the weight.
*  But at 170, Hamza is the most terrifying guy on the planet.
*  Right. Because he's fucking horrific.
*  He knocks you out with one punch.
*  He's got crazy, crazy speed.
*  Yeah, but the speed is what is underrated off the charts.
*  Could you trust them to make the weight?
*  No, can't trust them to do shit.
*  The thing about that one weight cut that he missed by eight pounds, though,
*  that's New York.
*  And they stopped him from cutting the weight.
*  You know how they do it.
*  Fucking New Yorkers.
*  No, it's some some athletic commissions.
*  They don't they intervene a little.
*  They get it and they go, oh, he's not going to make it like.
*  Listen, they can make it.
*  You know, it ain't going to look good, but they can make it.
*  How do they get their two cents?
*  They did that with.
*  That's why Al had to fight Khabib, right?
*  Because they didn't think Max Holloway was cut.
*  They didn't want him cutting any more weight
*  because Max was cutting the weight and they were.
*  So 24 hours notice, Al steps in and he stepped in like a stud.
*  Let me say the raging ally.
*  He did. He didn't take him down after the second round.
*  He was supposed to fight Paul Felder, a totally different, totally different
*  you know, three rounds kickboxer.
*  He got taken down right away.
*  He went with him five rounds and he was with he was in there.
*  He was in there and that was without a camp for that.
*  He was he was fighting a three round.
*  He wasn't even getting ready for five.
*  Personally, that fight to me, I thought, kind of exposed like Khabib a little bit.
*  Like, obviously, he's undefeated and all that stuff.
*  But what if he would ever got in there with a dude that had a skill set like George?
*  Well, who could strike and also defend the take?
*  And yeah, but he did.
*  He did. He fought Justin Gage.
*  Justin Gage is a dangerous motherfucker.
*  I don't think his wrestling is the same even though he doesn't use his wrestling.
*  Yeah, doesn't use it to attack.
*  But he's hard to take down.
*  Justin's very hard to take down and Khabib dominated him in grappling exchanges.
*  The thing about George is he's just much bigger.
*  George is a big guy.
*  George fought 85, beat Michael Bisping.
*  Right. I know he's not really an 85er, but George at 170 is a big, strong one.
*  100 percent.
*  And it could be the same kind of deal where like when Izzy went up
*  and fought Jan Bojovic, it's like you got the 185 pound champ who's a virtuoso,
*  but he's fighting a guy that's just a lot bigger than him.
*  Yeah, a lot bigger.
*  If you're not going to have the time to prepare and get your body into a position
*  where you're in somewhat similar range in terms of strength.
*  You know, if you're in these crazy grappling exchanges,
*  that's what I say, plus Izzy just sucks on the ground.
*  He's not the best on the ground.
*  It's a fact. Yeah, he's not.
*  You know, I mean, which was surprising, the first fight with Paeda,
*  when he gets him down, you know, crazy and he had his back.
*  Yeah, I mean, he he could have did a lot.
*  He could have did a lot more with that.
*  He could have did a lot more with that. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Alex's level on the ground is not good either.
*  You know, but the thing is, he's getting better at defending.
*  He's getting a lot better at defending once he gets taken down.
*  And when he's on his feet, he's just a motherfucker to deal with,
*  especially as he's slowing down a little bit.
*  I don't think either those guys are going for a takedown, to be honest.
*  Jamal Hill or Alex?
*  But Jamal would be more capable of taking Alex down and doing well on the ground.
*  Jamal's not lost on the ground.
*  He just is such a good striker. He prefers to stand up.
*  It's a fucking fun fight.
*  I know it's a fun fight.
*  That's why I'm going to have goose bumps before that one starts.
*  Oh, here we go.
*  The whole cause like that.
*  Yeah. Opening. Yes.
*  I don't I don't understand why people were upset about that being the main event.
*  Oh, my God. They're crazy. Yeah. That's just dorks. Yeah.
*  What the hell did you expect?
*  What did you call? What did you want?
*  Yeah. What did you want? Where's Connor?
*  Do you guys think Connor will fight this year?
*  I think so.
*  They keep saying he's going to fight.
*  They keep saying he's going to fight.
*  But keep pushing it back, pushing it back.
*  I think so. I think after doing that movie and how
*  how much he had to put into that movie, I think he's going to want to go.
*  Yeah, I think he's going to want to come back to do something like fighting,
*  something that he loves to do.
*  This is the movie curse, the Tommy Morrison curse.
*  When he became a movie star.
*  I remember Tommy Morrison was like the man in boxing.
*  He was the Duke.
*  He was John Wayne's grandson, right?
*  Or nephew. What's like he was a nephew or some shit.
*  So they could call him the Duke, you know, and everybody thought
*  he was going to be the man. And then he fought.
*  He did Rocky.
*  And then after Rocky fought Ray, motherfucker.
*  Those are hard.
*  Oh, that might be one of the worst knockouts in the history of wars.
*  And it's it's he's out already.
*  And Mercer's keeping him up with punches.
*  He's tangled up in the ropes and Mercer's just tea.
*  Hung off with bombs.
*  Not to mention Ray Mercer knocked out Tim Sylvia.
*  Bro. Oh, yeah.
*  He hit it with that right.
*  That was when they agreed to be boxing only.
*  And Sylvia opened up with an inside leg kick.
*  And Ray Mercer.
*  Yeah, motherfucker.
*  Bro. What about who?
*  He was like 46 at the time.
*  What about Mercer when he fought in Japan?
*  Who had kicked him and he just said, fuck this and like got out of the ring.
*  Right. I don't remember what that was.
*  Or something. I'm fine.
*  I'm trying to remember who that was.
*  I don't remember. I remember with the Japan.
*  I looked like what?
*  Because he had Ray Mercer, I came to American top team when I was with them.
*  He came there a few times just to kind of see what MMA was like.
*  Yeah, there was a few boxers that gave it a go in kickboxing.
*  Both of Vince Phillips.
*  Yeah, Vince Phillips fought Masato.
*  Remember, he got his legs kicked and he was like, no, I'm straight.
*  No, they fought a while.
*  He fought a while.
*  He got really lit up in the legs, real bad.
*  Masato was so good, too.
*  Yeah. What about Butterbean?
*  Butterbean versus Genki Sudo.
*  Yeah, Genki Sudo, he hooked him, right?
*  Yeah. Genki Sudo was a stud.
*  Oh, fuck yeah, he was.
*  He was a good guy. He was great.
*  You had an adobu-dabu, didn't you?
*  No, no, I had a training session with all the Japanese guys
*  that were going to adobu-dabu one year.
*  I was in Japan with Hanzo and Hanzo was fighting in Pride.
*  So he wanted me and Hikato Ameda to go with everybody.
*  All the Japanese guys, they were filming it.
*  They were going over of Uno, Romuno Sato, Genki Sudo.
*  They were all getting together, all the adobu-dabu team together,
*  a grappling session. They were going to film stuff.
*  So he goes, I want you and Hikato to go down there.
*  It'd be good for you.
*  And I mean, it was my first time in Japan.
*  I'm like, I don't want to do shit, man.
*  I just want to fucking.
*  But I'm like, all right, fine, you know, Hanzo makes it go.
*  So the day before, Hien did something to fucking Hikato's legs.
*  So the Kado couldn't do nothing. Hien's a wild man.
*  So I had to go down. So it was just me.
*  You know, so they were with me.
*  But so I went with Genki Sudo at one point.
*  I went with a lot of the guys.
*  And it was like like four minute matches from like the feet.
*  So at one point, like I jumped guard and he went down.
*  He stood up and he started going around in a circle like,
*  oh, and they're all going, oh, I don't like that.
*  I open up and he goes for a leg lock. Oh, my God.
*  I got out of it. But it's fucking weird.
*  But they all did the voice. Oh, my God.
*  He was wild. He was wild.
*  Wild guy, man. Genki was supposed to be my first fight in the UFC.
*  Oh, Remy Bonjasky.
*  Ray, my friend, Remy Bonjasky.
*  Oh, he's not used to that. Yeah, he got head kicked.
*  He said, that's all right.
*  Well, Remy Bonjasky was amazing. Yeah, he was.
*  And he fought. He said it's such an interesting style.
*  Crazy knees. Yeah.
*  Hey, man, we just lost Rob Kamen.
*  That's not that really hard. Nice guy.
*  I worked out with that guy a lot.
*  I trained with that guy for like, like eight weeks period.
*  It was amazing. He was awesome.
*  Those Dutch guys are cool.
*  He's the coolest. He was the coolest.
*  I did a joint seminar with him in Canada one time.
*  He's just a cool guy.
*  Head kick. Ray Bursch is like, check, check, please.
*  Thank you. I'll enjoy that.
*  Franz Botha, he did well in boxing.
*  Remember? Yeah, he did.
*  Yeah, he figured out how to do it a little bit.
*  Start fucking people up. Those hands were so good.
*  Yeah. You know, those guys, if you could have like elite hands
*  and you could figure out the kicks, you had like a little bit of an advantage
*  because some of those guys, their boxing was not the best.
*  Right, right, right. You could just stay in close.
*  Yeah, I think the Genki pseudo get Raymond Decker also.
*  Raymond Decker got submitted. I think he did.
*  I think I remember him because I remember I think that was his only MMA fight.
*  I remember that guy because Longo used to always point that guy on this fucking guy.
*  Decker's in his prime as the wildest highlight reel of any fighter ever.
*  Fuck people up. He was an assassin.
*  He had his ankle fused.
*  His ankle had broken so many times that his doctor, he couldn't bend his ankle.
*  And his doctor was like, look, if you keep kicking with that thing,
*  we might have to remove it.
*  Fuck you. Wrap it back up.
*  Kicking people to he just once we got in there, he just smashed.
*  He kicked through everything.
*  He did. He kicked through your arms. He kicked through your elbows.
*  Ramon Decker's was a fucking machine, man.
*  And he was a small guy.
*  So he's fighting the elite ties that are all his weight and just piecing people up.
*  He was mean to. Oh, he was ferocious.
*  Yeah, just put on a Ramon Decker highlight.
*  He was ferocious, man.
*  He was the combinations.
*  He was the first guy that like perfected the duchy that Ernesto
*  Hus used to always do that left hook to the body, right low kick.
*  He would hit that thing.
*  It was a fucking thing of beauty.
*  And it was just such a fucking killer.
*  Such a killer.
*  Like just mean everything was hard.
*  Everything was hard.
*  Every fucking strike was full power.
*  And this motherfucker just put people away.
*  It's a little bit like Nate Landau.
*  Got a little bit.
*  Yeah, a little bit, bro.
*  Ramon Decker's was the fucking man.
*  His hands were so powerful to know.
*  There's a thing that he had above a lot of those guys was his punching power.
*  His hands. Oh, bro.
*  He's trying to go on the way down.
*  As he's on the way down, he's still trying to take off on him.
*  Ramon Decker's, bro.
*  Come on, son.
*  Let's see his hand in MMA after this.
*  He's a guy. He died young, too.
*  That's what I love about Jiu Jitsu.
*  He died young, too. He died.
*  Yeah, I think he died like a heart attack while he's riding his bike or something crazy.
*  He probably rode his bike like a fucking savage.
*  He's got right. Just yeah, he did everything hard.
*  Had a fucking heart attack.
*  He was a monster, man.
*  Imagine being stuck in the fucking ring with this guy.
*  I mean, and back then, there was nobody like him.
*  I mean, he was just fucking everybody up and he was so mean.
*  Old motherfucker.
*  Yeah. Holding him up to knee him.
*  Look at this. Kicking him through the ropes.
*  Like you had to stop him.
*  You had to pull him off you.
*  Look, dude's going down, head kicks him.
*  Bro, Ramon Decker's.
*  Bring on Genki.
*  Look at that. You would do that.
*  That was the thing that Rob Cameron was great at, too, that the low kick across the front of the legs.
*  He would step off to the left and throw that right low kick across both thighs.
*  Oh, that's a thudder.
*  Bro Ramon Decker's.
*  I mean, what a highlight reel.
*  Who's fucking highlight?
*  I know everybody getting smoked.
*  It's all everyone just getting pieced up.
*  And the power that motherfucker had with his kicks, with his punches, everything.
*  He just destroyed people, but he destroyed his own body, too.
*  I mean, his his ankle was completely fucked by the time his career was over.
*  What are Steven Seagal shit in that?
*  Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.
*  Bro, the Brazilians love Steven Seagal.
*  What does he pay those guys to be hanging out with him?
*  No, I think Anderson had a great sense of humor.
*  And I think Anderson loved those movies when he was a kid.
*  And it was for like when I met Chuck Norris,
*  I was like, oh, my God, I'm Chuck Norris.
*  I hug Chuck Norris.
*  Wow. So for Anderson, it might have been like the fucking first one.
*  What was the first one?
*  Above the law.
*  Bro, that was a good movie.
*  When everybody was a good fucking movie, everybody like that movie was legit.
*  So if Anderson fell in love with that, Steven Seagal, it makes sense.
*  What about what about Alpha Justice?
*  Alpha Justice was in.
*  Anybody seen Bobby Lupo?
*  It was horrible. It was fucking horrible.
*  That's the one where he was in Brooklyn.
*  He pretended to be a gangster.
*  He wanted to be Italian in the worst way.
*  Well, that was when the mob was allegedly sponsoring his movies.
*  He had like a mix up with the mob.
*  The mob was involved in financing his movies like Steven,
*  I don't think you understand here.
*  Holy shit.
*  He should show them how to grab him by the nose.
*  This is what you do. Just grab him by the nose.
*  Imagine telling Anderson Silva, when you get in the clinch,
*  just grab him by the nose.
*  Watch this. Take him down.
*  Grab his nose.
*  What the fuck he's saying.
*  He's giving him coaching.
*  It's it's adorable.
*  And Anderson's listening.
*  But the thing is like Anderson might be able to take something from some of this.
*  That's true. Yeah, that's true.
*  Man, he's creative, right?
*  Remember when he hit Tony Franklin with that step in elbow?
*  And you know that he had to train that away from his coaches
*  because his coaches told him to stop drilling that.
*  You're not going to use that. Really?
*  And so he made his wife hold pillows so his wife would hold pillows.
*  He would step in and throw that elbow.
*  No kidding. Yeah.
*  And then he did it on purpose just to show them.
*  Fuck you. Yeah, I can do this shit.
*  And this was this is when Anderson before he came over to the UFC.
*  Look at this. Boom.
*  Is that when he got his head split?
*  Bro, come on.
*  No, they just he killed him.
*  But, bro, Anderson in those days when he was fighting in England,
*  that's when he became Anderson.
*  So when he came over to the UFC to fight Chris Liebman,
*  I was like, everybody hang on.
*  Yeah, I remember that is the motherfucker.
*  We fought me and Dean Thomas fought on that card.
*  It was the it was the tough four finale.
*  It was. Oh, he did.
*  Chris Liebman didn't get close to him, and that was a row.
*  That was a clinic.
*  That and Rich Frank.
*  Yeah, both. He just brutalized brutalized those guys.
*  But that was that was an Anderson became Anderson, you know,
*  like when we fought Rio Chonan and pride and Rio Chonan flying,
*  scissored him to a heel.
*  I remember that wasn't as good back then. Right.
*  It was just there was something missing.
*  And then he goes to England and then he finds himself.
*  And then he starts fucking everybody up.
*  Jorge Rivera. Yeah, for sure.
*  Remember when Jorge stood right in front of him, let him punch him in the face?
*  Mm hmm. I mean, it's like Anderson was on another planet.
*  I know he was on another planet.
*  Man, he was the Murray.
*  They're Lee Murray.
*  He was dangerous.
*  Dangerous. I was at the club that night that Lee Murray got into that fight with Tito.
*  I was there. Did you see it?
*  It was in London. Did you see the fight?
*  It was in London on Manchester.
*  It was that where the fuck was that?
*  It was London. It was London because he beat up Tito and Tito.
*  I remember he came up to me.
*  Slippery shoes. Yeah, slippery shoes.
*  First of all, when you're looking to do his eyes, you know,
*  because he was talking to me in the club and he's like, yeah, you like the Jiu Jitsu.
*  I can't do the accent, but he's like, yeah, he's asking me about my.
*  He says, yeah, you like the Jiu Jitsu. I like to knock people out.
*  I thought he was like a crazy knucklehead.
*  So I was just talking to him like, oh, yeah, cool.
*  And then when I left later that night, I heard he fucking knocked out Tito, dropped Tito.
*  Yeah, he was a real gangster.
*  Obviously, a real gangster.
*  Imagine a guy that's that good at MMA and fighting is actually a real bank robber.
*  I know because he fucked a lot of people up, man.
*  They did like a little mini documentary on on that.
*  I don't know if it's Showtime or HBO or who it was.
*  Could have been on Netflix.
*  Wasn't Guy Ritchie going to do a film about that heist?
*  That's what I was wondering.
*  He would have. It was a cool story.
*  Is crazy. Yeah, they should have did that.
*  That'll be a bunch of fighters put on tactical gear and robbed 50 million dollars.
*  Had to love his mural in his house in Morocco.
*  He had a mural in his house of submitting.
*  Showtime, last year.
*  Oh, that's a story.
*  It was last year. It came out.
*  Just came out. Oh, it's a mini series.
*  Not just. Oh, so some year ago.
*  Was this guy?
*  Richie is crew.
*  Oh, it says Guy Richie is making a movie.
*  No, no, it's not.
*  Does it say he is?
*  It does not say he is.
*  It says he's catching lightning.
*  It's more like documentary.
*  He's got to take his coach and people like that.
*  People that were around when the heist happened, all that stuff.
*  But if you click on that, it said Guy Richie is making a movie that someone's responding to that.
*  But is that just rumor?
*  Yes. Someone said you said something about it.
*  Oh, I'm probably lying again.
*  I'm probably spreading more misinformation.
*  God damn it.
*  In the trailer, it would probably say Guy Richie's name right on it.
*  Oh, so this is a documentary.
*  Documentary.
*  Oh, it's a documentary series.
*  Oh, well, that's got to be really interesting.
*  That's what I want to see.
*  This is the real thing.
*  This is actually good.
*  Oh, beautiful.
*  So that was out April 7th?
*  Yeah, check it out.
*  It's out right now.
*  Last year.
*  Oh, OK.
*  And it's called Catching Lightning.
*  Yep.
*  So I will check that out for sure.
*  It was good.
*  It's a crazy story, man.
*  But he was a real elite fighter.
*  He was a dangerous knockout striker.
*  Yeah.
*  That's on Showtime?
*  My wife is the one that showed me that it was on.
*  We watched it.
*  It was good.
*  I saw him fight live.
*  Well, obviously in the Jorge Rivera fight, but I saw him fight live against
*  Amir Renevardi.
*  He was a fucking killer, dude.
*  He was a killer.
*  Lee Murray was a dangerous dude.
*  He could box.
*  Dangerous.
*  He had good hands.
*  Dangerous puncher.
*  And he had something there.
*  I remember, and this was, I mean, shit, that was when I seen him at that club.
*  I mean, when was that?
*  Early 2000s.
*  And I seen something in his eyes.
*  He could tell.
*  Do you remember when he got stabbed in a knife fight and then was in the hospital,
*  almost dead, and then hit and pat six weeks later?
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Show Lee Murray.
*  I think it's like I legitimately think it was like six to eight weeks after getting stabbed,
*  if I remember it correctly.
*  He was hitting mitts.
*  And I was like, this is the most insane thing I've ever seen in my life.
*  See if you can find that because it was a video that I read.
*  It wasn't like that he was tearing the mitts up, but he was hitting mitts
*  after getting stabbed in the heart.
*  In the heart?
*  In the heart.
*  Bro, I mean, he got stabbed a bunch of times.
*  That's crazy.
*  He should have died and lived.
*  And then next thing he's hitting mitts.
*  And then after that, he's planning a bank robbery.
*  What a fucking crazy one.
*  What a fucking media.
*  You'll see on the documentary, like they kind of show they kind of say he's not,
*  you know, he ain't the mastermind.
*  They like set him up to be that guy.
*  Oh, the mastermind.
*  I wouldn't think he's the mastermind of the organization.
*  I think it's a little crazy.
*  But just the fact that he was there.
*  Well, that's the kind of guy, if you're going to rob a bank.
*  They were in on it.
*  It's, I mean, it was pretty crazy.
*  And it wasn't at the largest amount of money like in stolen and British history or something like that.
*  How did they catch him?
*  How do they know who did it?
*  I mean, I'm going to ruin the documentary.
*  OK, don't don't.
*  Yeah.
*  Is there a video of him hitting the pads after being stabbed in the heart?
*  See if you can find that.
*  Because it's so crazy.
*  Off topic.
*  It was on YouTube, I believe.
*  Does this thing dissolve when I spit this thing out?
*  You spit it out.
*  Oh, OK.
*  I didn't know.
*  I got the gum.
*  Yeah, it gets a little chewy.
*  Can I have another one?
*  Yeah, get in there, sir.
*  Thank you.
*  I'm junky.
*  Now where's that Cat Williams shit?
*  Let's go.
*  Uh oh.
*  No, no, I'm only kidding.
*  My kids are watching.
*  Fuck.
*  Let's fucking go.
*  Cat Williams stuff is not for amateurs.
*  Give me a Zen.
*  Give me a Zen.
*  Thank you, bro.
*  Let's go.
*  Let's go.
*  Ready to revive for round three.
*  Do you remember when Panama Lewis gave Aaron Pryor that green one?
*  Getting the one I mixed.
*  Not that one.
*  Yeah, the other one I mixed.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he came out, woo.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you guys remember when Craig Hardy wanted somebody to give him a fucking never mind?
*  Greg Hardy the wrestler?
*  No.
*  No.
*  Everybody forgot I shouldn't bring it up.
*  Thank God.
*  Greg Hardy was fighting and he goes, man, I need my inhaler.
*  So his corner guy, he must have been new to the UFC.
*  He goes, all right.
*  It was Dean Thomas.
*  Dean, I'm sorry.
*  Oh, you were fighting Greg Hardy.
*  No.
*  Greg Hardy was fighting.
*  Dean was cornering Lewis.
*  Oh, Greg Hardy, the heavyweight guy.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Yes.
*  USADA approved.
*  I asked the dude and he said yeah.
*  Is that not USADA approved?
*  Who handed it to him?
*  I handed it to him.
*  How many mother-
*  Is that not USADA approved?
*  No, it's not.
*  Oh, boy, and they did it on camera.
*  But in reality, if a dude fights with asthma, you would think he'd be cleared to use his
*  fucking inhaler.
*  Right, but what does the inhaler do for you?
*  It opens your lungs up.
*  Would it be beneficial for someone who doesn't have asthma?
*  It's bronchial.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  Yeah, then you can't use it.
*  But no, but he has asthma and he got cleared to have it in the back.
*  Oh.
*  Not in the corner.
*  He thought he was able to have it in the corner.
*  So when I asked the guy, I said, can he have this?
*  He said, yeah, I think so.
*  So I gave it to him.
*  Well, sorry to bring that up.
*  Dana threw me under the bus.
*  He was like, yo, that damn Dean Thomas, how could he do this?
*  Right?
*  Oh, man.
*  Keep the fuck up.
*  It's the rules.
*  You know, it's complicated too because the rules keep shifting a little bit.
*  Right.
*  Rules in different states are all different.
*  State to state, it's 100% different.
*  But the testosterone rule was the craziest rule.
*  Of all the rules that have ever existed in the UFC when they started giving people
*  testosterone, that was the craziest rule.
*  I know.
*  That was the craziest rule.
*  That was the craziest.
*  There were wild west days where people could take whatever they wanted.
*  What years was that where they were just allowed to guys for those?
*  That's a good question.
*  I want to say it's like 2010ish.
*  Yeah.
*  What year did Luke Rockhold fight Vitor?
*  Vitor came back a different man when he was here.
*  A different man.
*  He looked different.
*  Physically, way different.
*  That was when he spin kicked Luke in the head.
*  Remember?
*  Yup.
*  Luke Rockhold said, I was looking at this guy at the weigh-ins going, what the fuck is he on?
*  Because Vitor was just like a fucking silverback.
*  Just like, ahhh.
*  I mean, when he first came on the scene, he was like 220, he had traps up to his ears.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  When he first came on the scene, I was there for his first fight, UFC 12 in Dothan, Alabama.
*  And no one knew what to expect because everybody thought that Vitor was a Carlson Gracie Blackbelt,
*  so they expected him to just be a jiu-jitsu guy.
*  But he came out with them Brazilian fucking model shorts on and the MMA gloves
*  and just tuned up Trey Tellegman.
*  They called him Victor Gracie.
*  Yeah, that's what we called him.
*  That's what we called him back then.
*  We called him Victor.
*  I was at his school when he was training back then.
*  I was at Carlson Gracie's in 97.
*  That's part of how the reason I got this gig.
*  You know, it's funny, I interviewed him once and he mentioned that, that you used to train there.
*  Yeah.
*  I trained there in 96.
*  That's when I started training there.
*  When he killed Vanderlei in that fight, Vanderlei was a savage too back then.
*  Just people didn't know yet.
*  He came out with wrestling shoes on.
*  Yeah.
*  He came out, like, remember he was like, almost like he was freezing him.
*  He was in, like, Vanderlei was in waiting.
*  Alvaro Romano, you know, the guy at Ginostica Naturale.
*  Yep, yep, yep.
*  He used to be, like, I guess part of the Carlson team.
*  And he said, like, Vanderlei was pissed because he thought Vitor was in the back trying to freeze him out.
*  And what Alvaro said was that Vitor was petrified, said he was in the back, was crying,
*  and they had to make him go out there.
*  And then he went out there and machine gunned Vanderlei across the cage.
*  Like, so crazy.
*  Finally, it was terrifying back then.
*  I heard that story, right?
*  So I had to, as a journalist with integrity, I had to ask him about it.
*  He said that he had stomach problems.
*  Is he going to admit?
*  No, I know.
*  That's the same thing I thought.
*  That's the same thing I thought.
*  That's the same thing I thought.
*  But I had to ask him about it.
*  2013.
*  So it was 2013.
*  So 11 years ago, they were juicing.
*  Yeah.
*  We know something happened because he made an excuse.
*  Yeah, no doubt.
*  He had stomach problems.
*  Yeah, he said he had stomach problems.
*  How many years they had TRT for?
*  When did it start?
*  That's a question for Novitski, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Dan Henderson was on that shit, right?
*  Yeah, but not for a while.
*  He was on, like, later.
*  He wasn't, I don't think you, and he was on a low dose of it.
*  And when he got off it, he's one of the few guys.
*  It was basically the same guy when he got off of it.
*  He couldn't drain his heart, I think he said.
*  But he knocked out Hector Lombard after he got off of it.
*  That was post-TRT days.
*  He was still fucking people up.
*  Remember when he knocked out Fedor?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Dan Henderson knocked out Fedor.
*  Yeah, he ducked under, he snuck out the back door,
*  and hit him with an uppercut.
*  Boom!
*  Because Fedor had him rocked, and he went down.
*  He was on his back, and Fedor jumped on him.
*  He grabbed ahold of a single, snuck out the back.
*  Boom!
*  And then just hammered him with that fucking Hendo right hand.
*  Woo!
*  Dude, the Bisping knockout was the craziest.
*  The craziest.
*  Because he gave him the little...
*  The craziest.
*  The flying punch, and that became his logo.
*  I know.
*  After watching Tuff and Bisping, you know, he's a...
*  Look, I like Michael Bisping, and he's an instigating motherfucker,
*  and he was on him the whole time.
*  So you almost were happy, you know, at that point that Dan got his revenge.
*  Dan's an animal.
*  But now I work with Bisping, man.
*  I like him a lot, man.
*  And I hate watching that clip, man, because I like him so much.
*  Boy, you don't want to see your boy get hurt.
*  It's rough watching a guy get hammered in the face after he's out cold, too.
*  That's a rough one.
*  That guy's...
*  I mean, I like Bisping when he was on Tuff, like when he came up.
*  He was obviously a talented guy and wound up becoming a world champ.
*  And he's a solid guy.
*  Very solid guy.
*  You know?
*  He's entertaining.
*  We should mention that he won that rematch.
*  I got fucking hiccups.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He won the rematch versus Dan Henson.
*  For the title.
*  When he was a champion.
*  Did he have one eye at that point?
*  Yep.
*  He had one eye at that point.
*  Come on, man.
*  Well, how about the craziest one was when he beat Anderson.
*  And then he gets his mouthpiece knocked out.
*  He's pointing to the referee to get his mouthpiece back.
*  And Anderson hits it with a flying knee and walk off.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a walk off KO.
*  Yep.
*  And then they didn't call it because it was like the end of the fight.
*  And Bisping, like John McCarthy was doing the refereeing, right?
*  Wasn't it John?
*  I don't think so.
*  And then they didn't...
*  Was it her or was it John?
*  I can't remember.
*  At that point, it might have been her.
*  I think it was her.
*  But I think the fight wasn't over.
*  They had another round.
*  Their fight was not over because Anderson thought he KO'd him.
*  He hit him with that flying knee and dropped him and walked away like it was a walk away KO.
*  And then the fight kept going.
*  And he jumped on the cage.
*  That's right.
*  He thought it was over.
*  Meanwhile, it was like Bisping was blind in one eye.
*  So Bisping, when he's pointing to see where the fucking mouthpiece is,
*  he probably couldn't even fucking see it coming.
*  He's probably looking for his goddamn eye.
*  Jesus.
*  How many fights?
*  So here it is.
*  He fought how many times with one eye?
*  And then he walks away.
*  And they're like, no, it's not over.
*  He goes, what the fuck?
*  I think he just said, what the fuck?
*  Man, mentally too.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you come from that adrenaline dump?
*  Right.
*  Meanwhile, Bisping survived.
*  How tough is this motherfucker?
*  One eye and survives.
*  He's a savage.
*  Crazy, right?
*  And by the way, that left eye that's fucked up, that's the good eye.
*  That's the good eye.
*  That's the good eye.
*  That's the eye he can see out of.
*  And he comes back and he wins the fifth round, which is bananas, man.
*  Just fucking bananas.
*  And even to win the title, Bisping had to beat Luke Rockhold.
*  Luke Rockhold took him out the first time.
*  And he beat him on short notice.
*  That was another very short notice fight.
*  One of my favorite moments is right before they were going to fight, Luke was going to him.
*  And he's like, what's that, buddy?
*  And he goes, he doesn't want to touch hands.
*  He's like, touch in a minute, motherfucker.
*  He's like, what's that, buddy?
*  OK, yeah, I'll touch you in a minute, motherfucker.
*  He's funny as shit.
*  It was great.
*  His podcast was a wild victory.
*  He's good.
*  He's entertaining.
*  He's a fun guy.
*  He's got an interesting perspective about this Mike Tyson, Jake Paul thing.
*  Because even though Bisping only has one eye, he's been trying to get Jake Paul to fight him,
*  which is kind of crazy.
*  What's a nice paycheck?
*  Would they allow that?
*  A guy with one eye to fight?
*  I don't think so.
*  They shouldn't.
*  They're allowing a 60-year-old guy to fight.
*  They could do it on maybe the Saudi Arabia.
*  What do you think about this Mike Tyson, Jake Paul thing?
*  Do you think it's crazy?
*  It's always hard to say because he has the ability to drop him on his ass at any time.
*  Look, I think all the rules are to his favor.
*  Are we getting tricked by watching pad work?
*  We're getting tricked.
*  But if you look at the pad work, it's little three to five-second bursts.
*  Right.
*  It's not one round.
*  If he was doing that in all one round, I'd go, oh.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Anybody could put that together.
*  But also he's just starting to train again.
*  But still.
*  You know they're only going to be day one, day two.
*  Those videos, he's literally saying day one.
*  Here's the question.
*  How was his fight with Roy Jones?
*  I didn't see it.
*  How was it?
*  I think they had an agreement.
*  Not to punch the head.
*  Exactly.
*  He was told Roy would not fight him.
*  He wasn't trying to get hit in his head.
*  So they had a pre-arranged thing where he wasn't going to knock him out.
*  Mike was not trying to knock him out.
*  That's what it looked like.
*  The fight will be an exhibition, but it will be real fight rules.
*  I think this is when he was on the panady.
*  They're saying 16 ounce gloves and only two minute rounds.
*  Like that's to Mike's favor.
*  Yeah, that's it.
*  You know, two minute rounds for sure.
*  Because that was my biggest thing.
*  Like if he doesn't get him in the first couple rounds,
*  what kind of gas is he going to have at his age?
*  I don't know.
*  See, here's the thing.
*  It's at his age with a lot of supplements.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  You know.
*  Hey, look, I hope he wins.
*  God forbid if a YouTuber knocks him out.
*  57 year old dude with not modern hormone replacement and all that jazz,
*  I'd go he doesn't have a chance.
*  But 57 years old with just juice to the tits.
*  And Jake did.
*  I don't know, man.
*  Like what are the rules?
*  Like what are the rules?
*  Like what are you allowed to do?
*  Because if you just allow him to do whatever he wants to do,
*  it changes everything.
*  If it's an exhibition, no drug testing.
*  Email response from the Texas Licensing Commission.
*  The promoter is requested to have an event that day.
*  We not received any proposed cards and thus have no details of what they're planning.
*  And that will affect the possible rules.
*  All bouts are subject to review and approval by TDLR.
*  Please let me know if you need any other information.
*  OK.
*  So it's not necessarily carved in stone yet.
*  They might not approve it.
*  Interesting.
*  If a lot of people protest, maybe they will approve it.
*  Are they doing it in Texas?
*  I mean, they were trying to do it at AT&T Stadium.
*  That's crazy.
*  If Tyson dies.
*  Right.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  See, if you have something like that, if you have look, if that'd be the end of the.
*  Right.
*  The end experiment.
*  Let's imagine it in a different way.
*  Right.
*  Let's not imagine that Mike Tyson is fighting Jake Paul.
*  Let's imagine Mike Tyson is fighting some young,
*  like really powerful knockout artist who's a contender.
*  Well, guess what?
*  Jake Paul could be that guy if we didn't think of him as Jake Paul.
*  If you look at the people he knocks dead,
*  when he knocked dead Tyron Woodley with one punch,
*  that was their fucking crack.
*  Yeah, I was.
*  Honestly, so like that's what I'm saying exactly what you're saying.
*  We don't want to give him credit because it's Jake Paul.
*  Exactly.
*  But we got to wake up and realize that he's still 27, young,
*  and for the last four, five, six, seven years,
*  he's had the best coaches working with him one on one.
*  Now, we wouldn't be thinking that if it wasn't Jake Paul that he couldn't do it.
*  Right.
*  So you're right about that.
*  And he's dedicated.
*  And he's dedicated.
*  And if he was just some wild young dude coming up, knocking people out,
*  knocking out former MMA champions like Tyron Woodley,
*  we would go, whoa, keep an eye on this kid.
*  This guy might be something someday.
*  He's on the way up.
*  Tyson grew up in this sport.
*  100%.
*  But he's also 57.
*  And I think he's going to be 58.
*  Yeah, he'll be 58 at the time they fight.
*  Which is wild.
*  My question too is, how do you think?
*  Like Jake Paul, all the guys he's fought are much smaller than him,
*  whether people want to say so or not.
*  Ben Askren fought his whole life at 70.
*  Nate's 55 and 70 pounder.
*  Tyron's 70 pounder.
*  So this guy's walking around well over 200, cutting to 85 for these fights.
*  This is finally a dude.
*  He didn't hurt the Tommy Fury dude.
*  He didn't hurt Nate really during the fight.
*  I thought Nate's inactivity.
*  He didn't really get busy in there.
*  Nate apparently had a fucked up shoulder going in that fight.
*  All right.
*  Well, then that would make sense because he didn't really throw.
*  That's what I heard.
*  That might not be true.
*  So how is he going to handle, again, the age is the factor.
*  But, you know, a big strong.
*  Two minute rounds ain't bad.
*  I'm saying.
*  Two minute rounds aren't bad.
*  And it's just like you said, if they got him on the right fucking mixture.
*  They're going to have to.
*  Even if he's just counting.
*  How are they going to be competitive?
*  And they don't.
*  But if they do have him on the right mixture, how do you pass drug tests?
*  How does that work?
*  I mean, is there a drug test on an exhibition?
*  I don't know.
*  That's a good question.
*  Because if there's not, ye fucking hawk.
*  Yeah, I know, right?
*  That's the only way.
*  Drugs is the only way I think he's competitive.
*  Right.
*  He has to be.
*  I mean, that's obvious.
*  If you just look at him, though, he has to be on some kind of hormone replacement.
*  He looks pretty fucking yoked.
*  He looks pretty yoked.
*  What a comeback since the hangover, huh?
*  He was.
*  I mean, right.
*  He got big for a while.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  When he was doing the one man show and all.
*  It sucks when you're fat.
*  Well, I've never really got fat.
*  Both Tysons on the podcast.
*  I had Tyson when he was big, when he wasn't training at all.
*  And I said to him, you don't work out at all.
*  He goes, I'm afraid I'll ignite my ego.
*  Oh, man.
*  That's terrifying.
*  And that's what happened.
*  He ignited that thing inside of him.
*  When he came back for the Roy Jay.
*  It was two different interviews.
*  Two different humans.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  Jamie was the first one to say it's like a totally different person.
*  He was way more intense.
*  Way more terrifying.
*  Probably.
*  And you can imagine he's going to be in that mindset.
*  Supplemented up with all those Anastromes, Dolicenes.
*  How you say them again?
*  You got to be in that mindset, though, when you're getting ready to fight, though.
*  You're in a different mindset.
*  The thing is, if he's physically capable of recapturing 70% of what he used to do,
*  just dealing with that, just dealing with that with probably 90% of the power.
*  70% of the physical ability and 90% of the power.
*  Because the power is not gone.
*  You see it when he hits a bag.
*  Yeah, he's still got the power.
*  The power is there, 100%.
*  But he's had a bunch of back issues.
*  He had real bad sciatica.
*  He was having problems walking and stuff.
*  He was walking with a cane.
*  So, but who knows what they've done?
*  Stem cells.
*  I'm sure he's with the right people.
*  Even at 57, you can make a lot of money if Mike Tyson's fit and in shape,
*  which is so crazy to say.
*  It's just weird that we even talk about it.
*  100%.
*  That the fucking guy from Disney is going to fight Mike Tyson, the YouTube kid.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  And the path to beat Mike always was long dudes that had a good jab.
*  Later in his career when he wasn't moving his head anymore.
*  So I don't know if Jake can keep Mike off with his jab.
*  We're going to see.
*  But Jake could grab him and wrangle him.
*  I mean, that's what he does good.
*  He wrangles guys.
*  Tyson's people are going to be in the back saying don't let him wrestle us.
*  He'll be wrenching those fucking arms the way he used to.
*  He used to do some jujitsu with it.
*  If Tyson can have a flashback to the glory days,
*  if there's just like a moment where he just sees a combination and empties it on him,
*  that would be wild to watch.
*  For Jake to hurt him, he's got to be there to get hurt.
*  I know he's not exactly Muhammad Ali.
*  And exactly.
*  So if Tyson can still move his head like he used to move his head.
*  Now, the thing about lower backs, though, if you got a lower back problem,
*  you got to kind of like save that movement.
*  You can only do it so many times where it's painful.
*  It all depends on the condition of his lower back because you've got to think
*  Mike Tyson in his prime.
*  Go back and watch some of those early days.
*  He's just coming.
*  Yeah, he was moving.
*  This is so much to do, so much to calculate.
*  Bombs are coming your way and you're trying to hit it with jabs.
*  Like the customado Tyson was the whole problem.
*  The head movement.
*  People forgot how hard he was to hit his head.
*  Move sick.
*  That's what's not in his career.
*  And I mean, really, that was a big difference.
*  Exactly.
*  And I think that coincided with back problems.
*  I just and he also had neck problems.
*  I believe he had a neck surgery because, you know, he's just a lot of those
*  wrestlers.
*  Bridges.
*  That guy's neck, dude.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And you got to think of how many dudes like Lennox Lewis just teed off on his noggin.
*  And Vander Holyfield just teeing off on his noggin.
*  What is that doing to your neck?
*  That can't be good.
*  But my whole thing is this, man, like if what we saw with Vitor Belfort and
*  Evander Holyfield, if that's any indication and Vitor was 45.
*  Right.
*  You got a but.
*  I mean, it was burnt on the show.
*  I know.
*  So is Jake.
*  You think Jake is?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe.
*  I mean, why would he be?
*  He's also young.
*  And he's still 27.
*  Right.
*  So maybe he's not.
*  But either way.
*  He's got natural testosterone.
*  Yeah.
*  A lot more.
*  Aren't you just shooting a movie?
*  What?
*  That's right.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  That's.
*  Yeah.
*  What'd you do?
*  I'm shooting a movie.
*  With Denzel?
*  No.
*  What?
*  No.
*  I'm not.
*  I'm Denzel.
*  No.
*  Did you say Denzel?
*  No, I called myself Denzel.
*  I'm getting my Denzel.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I'm OK.
*  That's the independent film I'm doing in LA right now.
*  Yeah.
*  So.
*  Nice.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't get stabbed by any homeless people.
*  No, no, no.
*  Be careful.
*  No, I stay.
*  No, man.
*  LA, I don't like LA.
*  It's weird.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird now.
*  There's no optimism left in the city.
*  No, it's a city that's abandoned.
*  Yeah.
*  San Francisco.
*  It's a weird place.
*  Oh, they're all fucked.
*  And it happened so quick.
*  It makes me wonder, like, what is that going to be like in five years?
*  Everybody got out of there, huh?
*  Look how quick San Francisco got cleaned up.
*  When Xi Jinping came in his house.
*  When Xi Jinping showed up.
*  Isn't that amazing?
*  And then bam, right back to it.
*  I was saying, if I was the mayor of San Francisco,
*  I'd just buy that dude a condo.
*  Come stay.
*  Whenever you're here, they're going to clean the streets.
*  All the problems are fixed, right?
*  So what happened?
*  Fucking take care of them.
*  When he came into town for a conference, they cleaned up the streets.
*  Everything.
*  Everything.
*  They got rid of all the homeless people.
*  Put barriers up.
*  They couldn't get up on their tents.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Where did they put the people?
*  Exactly.
*  What Gavin Newsom said that was so hilarious, he said, well, when guests come over,
*  you clean up your house.
*  Like, bitch, keep your house clean.
*  You got human shit all over the floor of your house.
*  This is crazy.
*  He's a psychopath.
*  He can lie to your face without even blinking an eye.
*  So weird to watch him do it, too.
*  It's like 1980s Roadhouse line.
*  For real.
*  It's not even good.
*  He's the one that got caught eating out.
*  Indoor.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's like, well, I've been bad.
*  You got me.
*  Or something like that.
*  He was like, you shouldn't really do that.
*  And I was, you know, my bad.
*  It's like, dude, you fucking slime.
*  He's so slick.
*  And he looks like a guy who could be president.
*  And we're dumb.
*  We're like, I think he talks good.
*  He looks like Christian Bale on American Psycho.
*  He does.
*  He does.
*  But it's like, you know, if he says the right things
*  and he talks the right way, look, Biden won.
*  Say it with a smile and you're good.
*  Biden won and he's barely alive.
*  So yeah.
*  There you go.
*  And they're running him again.
*  I'd rather have Terry Crews from Idiocracy.
*  Terry Crews could win right now.
*  Yeah.
*  If he ran with that wig on.
*  If he ran with that wig on, Terry Crews.
*  Everybody loves Terry Crews.
*  Their plates were Gatorade or whatever the drink was.
*  Bro, you want to know the wildest shit.
*  The Rock told me.
*  He told it on the podcast that they called him
*  and contacted him about running for president.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Wasn't on the podcast?
*  I think he said both sides.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah, they contacted him and asked him if he wanted to run.
*  The Rock.
*  What?
*  That's Idiocracy.
*  That's what it is.
*  I mean, for sure.
*  How about he could win?
*  I know.
*  Oh, I would probably vote for him.
*  I would probably vote for him.
*  I mean, the dude is disciplined.
*  He's a good guy.
*  Jacked.
*  I want a jacked president.
*  Right.
*  You want somebody who's fit.
*  I want a president where every other president has to step aside
*  The Rock is here.
*  The Rock Johnson details how political party asked him to run for president.
*  Yeah, on my podcast.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  In that wild, dude, asked him to run for president.
*  He knows for the Democrats, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  And if he did win.
*  I mean, he was by his election.
*  Take a look.
*  There we go.
*  That is the president.
*  Come on, son.
*  If the Rock won and then came out like that.
*  That was the name of it.
*  Imagine if the Rock won and came out with that outfit on.
*  Can I just say if anybody out there has not seen Idiocracy, they should watch that.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's so good.
*  It holds up.
*  Mike Judge.
*  What a genius.
*  He's got animal.
*  Beefers and butt heads.
*  Everything.
*  Mike Judge is the man.
*  Office.
*  Was it with Office Space?
*  Office Space.
*  King of the Hill.
*  He's the man.
*  Mike Judge is the man.
*  He's a great guy, too.
*  He lives out here.
*  That's wild.
*  I had to be at him on Unfiltered once.
*  And the fact that he knew one of my fights.
*  I mean, I get weird when people like,
*  I don't think anybody watches anything.
*  You know, I'm like, and I was all like, because I don't get impressed with guys in Hollywood
*  and stuff, but I fucking love Office Space and all this shit.
*  When I like somebody's work.
*  I'm like, oh.
*  No, he's just a regular dude.
*  He seems it.
*  He's a real cool guy.
*  He's a fan, like a real fan of MMA.
*  He loves fights.
*  I met him years ago, too.
*  He's been coming to the fights for a long fucking time.
*  And he comes in to fights, too?
*  Yeah, I met him at the fights.
*  The first time I ever met him.
*  Was he a comedian as well or was he just a writer?
*  I don't think he did stand up.
*  I might be mistaken.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  He's a hilarious dude.
*  And what's upsetting is these movies that like they become like cult classics.
*  Like, I don't think Idiocracy or Office Space.
*  I might be wrong, but I don't think they made a lot of money,
*  but they are fucking classics.
*  If you see those movies.
*  Oh, I bet those movies made money.
*  I bet Office Space made money.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know about that.
*  Office Space was pretty big.
*  And then you got to think about all the DVD sales and all the streaming sales.
*  I don't think it's made like a, you know, a big theater.
*  I don't think it did.
*  I think he might have made it up on.
*  That's a funny movie.
*  It's pretty funny.
*  That's such a good movie.
*  But those movies, you can't get them today.
*  They don't make them anymore.
*  They don't make those wild, insane, funny, something about Mary type movies.
*  You can't.
*  Now somebody somebody's always going to get offended.
*  That's something about Mary.
*  This is great.
*  Oh, I remember.
*  I was stillers put out quite a few of them.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Dodgeball.
*  Thunder is one of the all time great comedy.
*  I'm telling you, could not make it today.
*  A lot of the humor just was different back then.
*  You were allowed to say you were allowed to joke about you were allowed to actually be funny.
*  It's about Ricky Bobby.
*  Yeah, man.
*  God damn.
*  That was a good one.
*  Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft.
*  They don't even make funny movies anymore.
*  I don't like it.
*  Such a judgmental world that we live in now.
*  Everybody's trying to attack things and take people down.
*  It's just so stupid.
*  In the beginning of Hangover.
*  Your friends.
*  This is so immature.
*  Ready?
*  Paging Dr.
*  Faggot.
*  He said they're like, you know, silly.
*  It's just silliness, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  But you can't.
*  People need more silliness.
*  They do.
*  100%.
*  We all do.
*  We all do.
*  That's why this is fun.
*  That shit was great.
*  That's why the four of us get together.
*  So we need a name.
*  The cook sticking around.
*  Is that going to be it?
*  I have to be a cook?
*  Unfortunately, I think we could take that name.
*  I think we're the fucking cocks.
*  Why not?
*  It's a funny thing to call yourself.
*  Just take that name.
*  You know why?
*  Because you'd think we would come up with something toxic.
*  Yeah, like the four horsemen.
*  Yeah.
*  But no.
*  The four horsemen.
*  Fuck you, Rugen.
*  Fuck you.
*  When you wrote that in the group text, I go, I'm going to wait until he says that.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Ah!
*  Exactly.
*  In studio.
*  Yeah.
*  The bulldogs.
*  Yeah.
*  What are we?
*  Piesons.
*  I think the cocks is a perfect, you know.
*  Cucks is funny.
*  It's funny.
*  It's like calling me tall or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Talking about shit.
*  We're talking shit right from the jump.
*  You can't take a show seriously.
*  It's called Cucks.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Definitely not.
*  So I want to see that.
*  On an episode of The Joe Rugen Experience called Cucks.
*  Yeah.
*  You got to protect your pox, then you got the cocks.
*  Yeah.
*  I like it.
*  I like it.
*  So that's it for now.
*  We'll put a bookmark on it.
*  We'll have to think about it.
*  You might get home, wake up in the middle of the night and go, I can't be a cock.
*  No, no.
*  John Brawler is going to be the one texting us, boys, let's rethink this.
*  The four horsemen has a ring to it.
*  For the record, I'm all in on Cucks.
*  I feel like Cucks is it.
*  It came to me in a dream.
*  Peer pressure.
*  If it stays in here, it's fine.
*  At my school, if somebody goes, hey, Professor Cuck, I'm going to fuck you up.
*  That's because my motherfuckers, he's getting comoran and then he's going to Tiger Shulman.
*  That's a fact.
*  It's not happening.
*  But I like it.
*  That's good.

*  I like it.
*  But then they do stuff just for the Midwestern people.
*  I don't give a fuck about the they play the hee haw music and they're like,
*  oh, you want to watch it?
*  Watch 1883.
*  I watched it.
*  I watched that.

*  That guy's over when it's over.
*  That Taylor Sheridan.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  He's a great guy.
*  So I had him on here is maybe one of the sickest movies of all time.
*  That was depressing, though, the 1883.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's what life was like.
*  I mean, man, that was a brutal existence.
*  Even the 1923, I like when they just start coming up with the.
*  But yeah, yeah, exactly.
*  Even them, like even the ones that are resisting it, they're like, well,
*  I don't have to get one of those washing machines or something.
*  They're like, it's like just coming out.
*  They're like, look, I'm I want to keep it like, like to our traditions.
