# Joe Rogan Experience #1449   Bryan Callen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 27, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy29eXpK0TM)
*  Yee-haw! Here we are. Are you a shooter? Well, dude, my ears are covered for the second time
*  today. I'm just going to say that. And I'm a, ask me that again. Were you a shooter?
*  That's funny. I'm a tactical shooter, bro. So have you ever done, we went to Tarrant
*  Tactical today and Brian Cowen learned the ins and outs. Learned how to lean forward,
*  had some Navy SEAL instruction as well. Yeah. How'd you feel? I love it. Fun, right? I've been
*  doing it in my head forever. Oh, in your head. Yeah. Doesn't really work. I've rehearsed,
*  I've rehearsed killing a gang many times. Sure. Lean in, kick, kick, kick. And I go like this.
*  Why don't you shoot them in the knee and rehabilitate them? Oh, that's such a good idea.
*  I think because they don't have knee targets. If they had just a bunch of tiny targets on the
*  ground. Well, I hit, which I don't like because I'm like, what am I shooting? Baby. I was gonna say,
*  they're the size of a toddler. Yeah, that's weird. I'm like, all right, so I got to kill the toddler
*  with one shot. A kid with a missile. Yeah, I was pretty accurate with that. That's kind of sick.
*  But yeah, that's a good idea. I could either waste them or wing them. I wing them. And then
*  take them in and teach them to err their ways. Yeah. And at the end, they'll be loyal to you.
*  I toss them an herbal remedy, an herbal wrap. Like Steven Seagal had in that one movie where
*  he was in a coma for like 10 years. And then he was kicking everybody's ass a couple of days later.
*  I don't care. I bet he says that shit was factual. Do you remember that movie? Very well. No, no,
*  no. You're way out of line. No, Above the Law is the first movie. This was deep into his career.
*  He's in a coma. This is Brock, he's the nurse. Yeah, he already got fat by this time. Oh, he had.
*  Yeah. That's where he ran terribly. He always runs terribly. But in the early movies, he was
*  skinny. And Above the Law, he was skinny. But then by the time he got to this other movie,
*  where he's in a coma forever, like, look at his fingers moving. He's waking up. Look. Awesome.
*  Actually, he wasn't too fat. No. Wasn't too fat. He looks great there. But he'd already, you know,
*  started to fill in his hair. And so then he was in a coma forever, and then gets out of the coma,
*  remember it very well. And starts doing all sorts of Chinese herbs and shit to become a bad. I'll
*  say he was pretty skinny back then. Yeah, he was. So this was early in the career. Yeah, he heals
*  himself. I would throw them an herbal wrap, and tell them how to wrap it. And then say, training
*  begins tomorrow at dawn. And then you wake them up. Yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. And I'd be
*  on horseback for no reason. Really? You and horses. Why do you always- Because there's something very
*  masculine. How many bits do you have when you're on a horse? It's my entire act. It's my entire act.
*  I just have this- There are a couple things I want to do before I die. One is to toss somebody
*  an herbal wrap and say, training begins tomorrow. Or be there tomorrow, and I want to rehabilitate
*  at-risk youth. But they're like 20. And then I want to rear up on a horse. I want to rear up on a
*  horse. But I want to appear out of nowhere, rear up on a horse, and rescue a group of women in the
*  wilderness. A group of women in the wilderness? What are they in the wilderness for? They got
*  lost. Were they hikers? Their plane went down. Nobody got hurt, but it skidded along a glacial
*  lake. Their plane went down? Yeah, it skidded. And they said, we can't find them. It's impenetrable.
*  It's impenetrable. And then you go- And they go, fuck. Fetch the-
*  Fuck. Fetch the man panther. The man panther? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's my nickname. Do you know
*  about this guy? His name is Dick Pronicky. And he was a guy who lived in Alaska by himself in a
*  cabin that he built for decades. And he moved out there when he was 50 years old. He got tired of
*  life and just the way everything was, the fast pace of modern life. So this guy decided, this guy,
*  amazing videos on YouTube. This guy built his own house out there in Alaska,
*  fashioned it out of logs. There's like a video of him doing the whole thing, filmed everything,
*  filmed all of his interactions with animals. Birds would come and land on his hand and he
*  would feed them. Oh yeah, yeah. He was you. He literally is you. Stoic by himself and wrote.
*  You know me, stoic and real solitary. Oh yeah, and real measured with his words. Of course.
*  And it's everything you want to be. And he would sit and every night he would write. And he would
*  write about his experiences and the deep satisfaction that he got off of living that kind of a life.
*  Right. Some amazing videos. Pull up one of the videos so you can watch how this guy's living
*  his life out there. But he would only see people once or twice a year when they would drop off
*  goods and things that he needed. But this guy was, you know, he wasn't a spring chicken.
*  He moved out there when he was in his fifties. Wow. Yeah. And when was this?
*  I want to say he had to. It's a ways back. Move back with his brother. I want to say in the early
*  two thousands, somewhere around that. That looks like 16 millimeter film. Yeah. Yeah. Oh dude,
*  he lived out there for decades. Like I said. Yeah. By himself. You got to know your shit to be out
*  there by yourself. Well, I think most of it he learned once he got there and he talked about it.
*  He talked about what the experience was like about just, you know, learning how fatiguing it is to
*  hike. Oh yeah. Learning how fatiguing it is to gather up your own firewood. And he made most of
*  his own tools. Like right there, he's making a mallet himself. He drills a hole in it with a hand
*  auger. And then he makes his own peg. And he only brought in tools to make tools. And the big tools
*  like that, he made all of himself. That's amazing. And what did he live on? Just deer meat? I mean,
*  yeah. Elk meat, deer meat, berries. He got some oatmeal and stuff, you know, some dry goods that
*  he would get in large barrels. So he'd come in and touch base periodically. They would come to him.
*  People would fly out to him with goods. But I mean, he built all this shit by himself. He built his
*  whole cabin by himself. And he documented every step of the way. Amazing. His name is P-R-O-E-N-N-E-K-E.
*  Dick Prenike, Alone in the Wilderness is the whole series on YouTube. And he's on the side of a lake
*  with this cabin that he built living off of animals that he hunted and firewood and,
*  you know, whatever food that he gathered. I'm obsessed with this now. Yeah. I got this Corona
*  thing caught me with my pants down. I want, here's what I want. I want a substantial cabin made of
*  thick logs or stone. And then I want it near a lake or a water source, maybe preferably a well
*  that I can irrigate my own crops. You're going to have crops? I'm going to have chicken. I need
*  chickens. You really only need a garden. You don't need crops. I need a garden. Is it just you? Yes.
*  Well, it might be me and my several of my friends, my lady friends, because I'm going to start my own
*  colony. So I have to breed. You understand? Okay. I need, I need a lot of hair and a beard dye
*  because I want to stay looking young. What if they come up with something that reverses you in age?
*  Now you're talking my language. How old would you go back to? David Sinclair will actually have a cabin
*  on the side. He'd be right next to you doing experiments. I'm going to have his fucking lab
*  and I'm going to be a skinny pig. Yeah. You'd be the guy. Yeah. David, come out, come on out.
*  And I'll just do Tyson. Tyson with all the girls. He'd come. Well, he's not into that. He's a married
*  man. Leave him alone. All right. But he'd like to come out just to hang out and pal around for a few
*  days. He's a fun guy. He seems like a good guy. He's a great guy. Yeah. And he's brilliant. And
*  he's brilliant in the field. That's very important. He's, what do you mean? You're getting old.
*  That's right. Yeah. That's right. You want to be Dick Prenike where you had to escape your,
*  your wilderness. Again, I, again, I, again, there are a couple of things. One more thing I want to
*  do is I want to split with my shirt off while I have women watch me through the window of my log
*  cabin as they're baking me a pie. And I know this is a chauvinistic fantasy. It sounds like it.
*  Don't worry. You sound like a real piece of shit. And the other thing I want to do before I die is
*  I want to have a horse. I'm so attached to it that I can go and then it just shows up. Oh,
*  so sort of like Brad Pitt's pit bull in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Correct. I'd kill for one of
*  those. That pit bull was that was fucking great. That thing just fucking knew what to do when to
*  do it. Yeah. Yeah. They don't use the cops. I heard don't use mass sifts, even a lot while it's
*  cause they do too much damage. Yeah. They don't like to let go. Then you got a major lawsuit on
*  your hand. You can't have somebody bite your fucking hand. Well, I was watching a fucking video of a
*  guy in San Diego who got arrested by these cops and cops couldn't get the German shepherd off his
*  arm. The German shepherds clamped down this guy's forearm. This guy's screaming and they're pulling
*  on the dog and the dog's pulling on the meat of his arm. You don't pull on the dog. They weren't
*  interested in choking the dog. Apparently they thought this guy was a bad person and they were
*  letting this dog chew this guy's arm up and you get permanent nerve damage. Oh yeah. I mean,
*  it's just devastating to the tissue in your forearm. I've seen video of it where I said,
*  I said to the cop showed it to me, I said, why didn't that guy was this giant AWOL,
*  human AWOL, just giant, he used to be a special forces guy and he just went crazy.
*  And they let that dog loose on, cause they had two cops that he was fighting off and they let this,
*  this wolf, this fucking wolf loose and grabbed the dude on the top of his arm. He had huge arms,
*  like Brennan shop, like big arms, grabbed, grabbed the guy and the guy just, I, in the middle of his
*  craze, he looked at the dog and then just went, he froze and went down and I said, why isn't he
*  punching? And he goes, because you shut down because when he bit that arm, that arm went numb.
*  You can't use that arm. That's the pain. The excruciating pain of a German shepherd biting
*  in your arm. Yeah. Oh, not good. Or a real wolf. That well, that's now you can't train them. Now
*  you get yourself a problem. Of course they're not interested in listening. They're not interested
*  in getting a wolf to attack. I'll tell you who's not hearing a fucking peep out of, out of a wolf.
*  And I'm talking about a timber wolf, not a peep. Who is Mr. Mountain lion. Okay. Mr. Mountain lion.
*  How that works. Mountain lions versus wolf. I'll tell you exactly how ready. Yeah. The wolf dies.
*  Really? That's right. Have you ever seen it? There's a video of it. First of all. Really? Yep.
*  Mountain lion is on his back by the way. Wolf tries to get over it. Mountain lion gets under that,
*  under the old jaw line. Oh, gets the neck. Yeah. And by the way, got his, uh, and holds on with those
*  claws. That's right. They have claws. Yeah. And it's more athletic. It's 150 pound, 140 pound,
*  130 pound mountain lion. Good luck with that. And there's, they fight solo. They don't need a bunch
*  of pussies backing you up. And they go low. They go fucking low. Like a lion. There's no, and there's no
*  sound. There's a great video of a water buffalo charging a lion, a male lion, and the male lion
*  literally waits until the water buffalo is closing the distance and then ducks under and grabs a
*  hold of it by the neck and just hangs on. Yeah. Wow. Actually might not have been a water buffalo.
*  It might've been something else. Like it was a cow. Some, some other rugged animal. It was a
*  rugged animal. Yeah. I forget which animal it was, but the animal makes a rush at the line. Like,
*  Hey, fuck you. And the lion's like, no, fuck you. This ducks under. And one of the problems when
*  you have a game reserve is that if you have a pride of lions, you are going to pay so much money
*  keeping that, that, uh, reserve stocked because a pride of lions goes through, you know, crazy
*  amounts of meat every single day, every other day. So they will decimate. They'll go through
*  a whole herd of buffalo. Well, that was an issue after the dentist, the dentist shot that line
*  with a name. Yeah. Remember that line with Cecil and then, um, do you know that they were worried
*  that Cecil's brother Jericho was killed? But no worries. It was a line that didn't have a name.
*  So literally I read an article that we're being serious about that. So they're being serious.
*  There was a real concern that Cecil's brother Jericho had also been killed, but turned out not
*  to be true. Like, it's the real lion king. Anyway, when, when they killed that lion,
*  when that dentist killed that lion, well, they then after that had, uh, this, this thing, this
*  international outcry where nobody wanted to go there and hunt lions because they didn't want to
*  be the next guy that gets targeted, but like that dentist. So because of that, they had to slaughter
*  a large number of lions. I'm sure finding out how they all the people that don't have any idea what
*  it is to sustain. I'm just, the number was crazy. It was something like, I don't remember it was 50
*  or 500. Yeah. But it was like they had to kill them. And instead of getting $50,000 per lion,
*  like they're accustomed to getting when people, cause they have all these lines, the lions had
*  decimated the undulate population. Of course, no one was killing the lions anymore. It's like
*  elephants. So now with elephants, you can't move a one, uh, like a member of the herd or two
*  members, elephants have to be moved as a herd. Otherwise they go nuts. Right? So they're, they're
*  the females rule the roost, but you can't just take like a three elephants from that herd and
*  then move them over to the gate. You got to take them all. Otherwise they really get fucked up.
*  Yeah. They love each other. They love each other. Yeah. But then also when you call elephants,
*  which you have to do in Kruger national park and things like that, why do they have to,
*  because they get too destructive, they just get too many of them and they just wait, lay waste to
*  the vegetation. It just becomes an imbalance. So the problem is that they were like, you can't
*  shoot them from helicopters anymore or jeeps, whatever, because you know, that's, and they
*  would kill the whole herd because you can't just kill a couple, right? Cause they go nuts.
*  And then they can't do anything with the ivory because the ivory trades illegal.
*  Correct. So then they store that. So then you make you jack up the price of ivory,
*  which they do the same thing with, um, rhino horn. But, but so that what now they try to do is they
*  try to, um, sterilize the females, right? They'll try to, oh, great. Good luck with that.
*  That's a lot of fun. That's really difficult to do as well. You know, they were trying to do that
*  on the Hamptons. They're trying to do that with deer. They're trying to give the female deer
*  birth control. Just let them fucking shoot dead loads into them. Yeah. Go ahead and shoot the deer.
*  I'll eat them. Well, that's what they should do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, but they didn't, they decided
*  for whatever goofy reason that what they were going to do is, uh, try to give them birth control
*  and they were going to spend countless amounts of dollars to get birth control into deer. Like,
*  how are you going to cat? What are you going to do? Do you know how many there are? Like,
*  apparently it's, they're infested out there. What, after watching tiger King, what is your
*  take on keeping a tiger suspect? It's ridiculous. First of all, I only watched one half of one
*  episode. I had a pause. I had a pause. Uh, Jamie and I were getting an NAD, uh, IV drips, which is
*  pretty fucking amazing. What is NAD? Uh, that's the stuff that David Sinclair was talking about.
*  Well, let's get O'Brien on the, on the NAD train. O'Brien might be a little cheap. It's expensive.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Costs, costs a pretty penny. I want to live forever. Okay. What would it talk
*  afterwards? Okay. I don't know. I've done two and I feel pretty good. You feel any different, Jamie?
*  I can probably say I feel pretty good. Yeah. So pretty good around inside. Yeah. But it feels
*  like the second one really took her over the top. What does it do? I have more energy. I mean,
*  I feel like really vibrant. I feel great. But it's hard to tell. Yeah. What does that mean? I'm
*  sleeping eight hours a day. I'm staying at home with my family. I'm not on the road. You know,
*  I mean, it's like, how am I sure this is it? But apparently scientifically it's provable,
*  right? Lengthens your telomeres. It actually decreases your biological age. Wow. It's been
*  proven. David Sinclair said that NAD, uh, HGH and, um, there was one other DHEA. Those three things
*  in combination have been shown to reverse your biological age. Yeah. Crazy. So we're trying,
*  I'm like, look, while this shit's going down, I want to keep my immune system at fucking
*  tip top Magoo as Joey Diaz would say, tip top Magoo. The greatest Joey Diaz ever. Um, but it's
*  just one of those things where there's, you know, there's a few different scientific advances that
*  they can absolutely show that will decrease your biological age and show that there's an increase
*  in your vitality, your ability to recover all these different things. So I'm getting in on all
*  that. Well, and the tiger came back to that. You know, you had 227 tigers as pets. They live in,
*  they live in a fucking cage and, and, uh, and then he had chimps. Chimps should never be kept in the
*  cage. I don't know. Fuck. When anybody says, so there's certain things I just don't think should
*  be, if you're, if it's a professional zoo like San Diego and they have habitat, I agree. And then
*  it's disturbing. But at least kids get to see them and it educates, you know, the general population.
*  But when you've got 10,000 tigers as pets, I don't know, man, especially my bit from, uh, triggered
*  from 2016. I loved your old original tiger bit. Oh, that was a great tiger. But one of the greatest
*  tiger, one of the greatest bits ever. I mean, you can make the argument for it. Two tigers fucking was
*  one of the greatest bits ever. You should do it. You should do that fucking bit. Dude, it's on. I
*  don't think that that's crazy. You should do that bit. You should revive that bit and you should,
*  you should tape it and you should put it out there. It's, let me say it again. I've been,
*  I know comedy doing this long time. It is top three bits of all time. That's very nice of you,
*  but it is, but it's, um, I think it's might be on an audio recording. It was the first time I saw,
*  first time I saw that we were at the comedy store. That, that it gets, oh, it's on, I'm
*  going to be dead someday. If that bit gets destroyed in the audio version, you got to see
*  the visual. You have to see the visual, dude, when you're making the noises. That was the first bit
*  that I ever did where I realized like you have to kind of become the thing. Yeah. Like you got to
*  become the thing. Like I would make noises, like try to be me still. But then I realized like, oh,
*  I just got to become like a tiger fucking. That's what I love about certain bits. Like for me, I,
*  I just sing about having an abusive father who was a piano teacher. Don't ask.
*  And I talk about his mustache, his mustache belonged, the bristles were so thick,
*  they belonged on the back of a board, not on a man's nose. And I go into this whole character
*  and I, I love to lose myself into that character. Or when I do that, that English,
*  that English supervillain, like I just fucking, like it's so fun to get lost in that character.
*  Cause you could think like that person, like that must be the appeal of like a guy, like a Daniel
*  Day-Lewis or someone who can really encapsulate, you know, they, they do something where they,
*  they become that. Yeah. They become that they're not, you know, and some people never do that.
*  They're just always acting like, Oh, here's that guy acting in a movie. I know who he is. Yeah.
*  There he's acting. And then some people just become. Jeffrey Tambor, who's one bunch of
*  Emmys for, you know, transparent. He said that he, for him, it was about shoes. He'd have to figure
*  out what kind of shoes, like he'd have to feel it first in his feet, which makes sense. Like when
*  you wear sneakers and, or you wear, uh, leather sold shoes, you feel different. You're not as
*  secure in leather sold shoes. You automatically become more formal when your toes are pushed
*  together, you know, when you're constrained like that, it's a weird thing to think, but it does
*  change you. Yeah. You can't even move good in leather sold shoes. They're slippery. Correct.
*  So if you see people, I can tell a lot about somebody by their footwear. If they're wearing
*  sandals, typically I can tell you what their political. Those are, those are, those are dad
*  sneakers. I don't give a fuck game over. And I do what I want. Joe Rogan. You don't know jack shit.
*  No, I like trail runner. I know what they are. What are they? They're trail runners. These are
*  Solomons. They're excellent shoes. Speedcross. I know all about them because I was born before
*  when we were going to go hunting with Ronella. I know all about those. They're awesome. So it's
*  tread. Yeah. So if you're going to go up like slippery terrain, this gives you grip. I'm all,
*  I'm all about trails, bro. But also you're like, I don't care. And I'll just wear this a little
*  bit of that. Also there's no shoelaces. Correct. So I go like this, I sent them tight. Yep. Very,
*  put it in here. Very easy. I tuck it in there. Yay. You know, we go to the airport really easy
*  with these on too. You know, it's never getting caught with those. You know, it's never getting
*  caught. Nope. I'll do it. I don't give a fuck. No, no chance. I showed him to him once and he
*  almost threw up. Yes. Yes. I wear these all the time. He can't handle it. Yeah. I wear these. I
*  wear Chucks. Yeah. But when I, if I'm doing anything in dirt, they're like a middle ground
*  between wearing a boot. Yeah. You know, like if you're, I wear them hunting sometimes. Yeah.
*  Those are, I looked at those for hunting. Yeah. A lot of guys in elk hunting in particular,
*  because you're so mobile, you're constantly chasing these massive herds and you're moving
*  around and going through, you have to come elk hunting. You've never been elk hunting.
*  I need the meat. Well, I have plenty of meat for you. I have the meat for you. Listen,
*  you've seen me shoot. You've seen me how I lead my targets. Just a couple hours ago.
*  You seem like you were born for it. Not only that I go get down. That's what you know. I said that.
*  I had earplugs in the, Oh, I was on radio. Also you have a, you say things in a, in a way that
*  only people around you can hear. That's true. You don't, you have the right amount of projections.
*  So the enemy never hears you. I speak cryptically. Andy stuff, Andy stuff. I did his podcast and he
*  had me, he wanted to see what kind of a tactical asshole I am. And he had me watch fit, fit, you
*  know, film shirt. Oh yeah. Cleared hot. Great podcast. I love him. The best, the best. And
*  he had me like, look at like different movie scenes and break down what was wrong. I was wrong. All
*  I was completely wrong about everything. I thought, I thought that when you shot a gun with a
*  suppressor, it was like, that's pretty loud. Pretty loud. You've never shot a gun with a suppressor.
*  I have actually in Utah, but it's loud. I was wearing earphones, your ear. So I couldn't,
*  but it's nothing like a, like a rifle. No. Like when we were hunting in Prince of Wales,
*  I had that gun with a muzzle brake. So loud. Yeah. That's a seven millimeter Remington ultra
*  mag. It's a very loud guy. That's so loud outside. It can hurt you. They say if you,
*  they say if you're too close to that, you can damage your ears permanently. 100%. Yeah. My,
*  one of my friends, there was a guy who shot near him, shot too close to his ear. Some, he was,
*  he's a guide and this guy apparently like went to swing, like the, the animal was close by,
*  like he's here. The animals close by or something, something happened where he shot
*  really close to his head and blew his ears out. Now he only has a hearing aids. Damn. He has to
*  wear hearing aids. Cause you're, you're that rifle that trigger is so sensitive. It's unbelievable.
*  Yeah. The idea is they don't want you to pull in hard, but different people have different
*  theories on that. It's the same with archery. With archery, some people like a very sensitive
*  trigger and some people like a, a trigger that's very hard to pull so that you, you can't just
*  jerk on it because you have to pull, pull, pull, pull, bang. And then it goes off. You know, like
*  when you, when you shoot archery, it's very interesting, but you would think, like say,
*  if you have like a wrist strap with a trigger on it, you would think that when you draw back,
*  you go like that. Yeah. But you, you would use your finger to hit the trigger, but you actually
*  don't. Some people do. Some people actually can do and shoot like cam Hanes does it that way.
*  Shoots very well that way, but cam Hanes is a psychopath. He's a different human being.
*  Most people, there's something about that thing that starts a flinch and anticipation flinch.
*  It doesn't with him, but some people, they get a thing called target panic. So they get away from
*  target panic. What they do is instead of pulling the trigger, you wrap your finger around the
*  trigger and the trigger is stiff. And then you use your back muscles. So then, then you aim and you
*  go like this. You just pull with your back muscles and it goes off without, without you even moving
*  your finger. So once I would hook my finger on it, my finger's in place and then I'm just pulling
*  and pop. It goes off. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Is it, is it crossbow? Does it have more range?
*  Crossbow is basically a shitty gun. It is. Just get a gun. Yeah. What are you doing? You're not
*  an archer. No. What are you doing? You got a shitty gun. It's a shitty gun. You think you're
*  walking dead. You're that guy with the motorcycle. Personally, yes. Listen, that, that whole walking
*  dead thing is so fraught with peril. First of all, how come there's no pass throughs? You're
*  shooting into these mushy zombie heads. It goes right in there. Why doesn't it blow out the other
*  side? Yeah, it would, wouldn't it? Fuck yeah. It would blow through an elk. Really? Yes. Jesus
*  Christ. Those things are going fucking 500 feet a second. Which is why I told Andy Stumpf he
*  should, they should, the special forces should have a crossbow division. They should. Um, not.
*  They should not. But also, he doesn't even have real tips. Those crossbows, they're using field
*  tips. It's basically a pencil point. It's like poking you and making a hole in you. It's not
*  going to kill you. Oh, it's, what do you mean? The crossbow? The crossbow's not going to kill
*  you with those tips on it. It's a little hole. It'll make a little pencil hole that'll go through
*  you and your body would seal up the wound. Is that true? Yes. So you could shoot me with a crossbow
*  with one of those arrows. You'd be fucked up, but you would live. But if I shot you with a crossbow.
*  Unless it was in my heart. Yeah, that would probably kill you. But like one of your lungs,
*  you'd probably live. But if you shot someone with a crossbow that had a real broadhead on it,
*  broadhead would slice you wide open like a samurai sword right through your whole body.
*  Yeah, that's what it's like. So easy to kill. Why are human beings so easy to kill? Well,
*  because we're smart. We have nuclear weapons. True. That's how nature balances it out, right?
*  Turtles are stupid as fuck. That's why they have that awesome cage over their whole body. It's true.
*  It's true. That's what it is. Yeah. Look, there's a balance to things, you know, that's and we
*  respect that balance. And we also, we want that balance to exist in everything. That's why if we
*  see a hot girl, we want her to be stupid. Correct. That's why people get caught with their pants down.
*  When you think a hot girl is stupid, and she turns out to be very intelligent, perhaps more
*  intelligent than you. Well, speaking of that, when I saw that we met the director of John Wick today,
*  yes, and he's a handsome athletic looking fella. He's a good looking guy. He doesn't look like a
*  director. He used to be a stuntman. He was a kickboxer and a Muay Thai guy. But he's he's used
*  to be Keanu Reeves stunt double, I guess. Yeah. But I looked at him and I was like, well, this
*  dude looks like a stud. He's kind of like a silvery fox. He's getting older. He's like my R age. But I
*  thought to myself, the guy looks like a real athlete. He must be a, you know, he's definitely
*  fit. Meanwhile, a fucking a big director. Yeah. And he comes there and shoots all the time,
*  all the time. He said they did twice a week. Dude, it's such a great thing to have. And it's also
*  really fun. It's like you're just shooting metal targets and everything like that. But it's it's
*  fun. It's there's something. It's the same thing with archery. It's the same thing with a lot of
*  stuff that you have to focus on. You focus and then you execute. And if you do it properly,
*  there's like sort of the meditative aspect to it, which sounds crazy to say that shooting guns
*  with earplugs on a very meditative. It's very. Yeah, there is. Because because it's like anything
*  else. I like getting comfortable and familiar with things that scare me. Yes, I like getting
*  comfortable and familiar with violence. I actually do. What I mean, yeah, because whether it's hunting,
*  whether it's boxing, whether it's jujitsu, but I like I like working at those things and putting
*  myself in uncomfortable positions that because when you go to a shooting range, like it's your
*  first time like with me with that kind of tactical thing, it's always going to be a little uncomfortable
*  because you're the new guy. You don't know what the fuck you're doing. You don't know how to
*  unload a magazine. It's just going to be mechanical and there's going to be a process.
*  But there's something about being in this strange location with that, those loud that you can become
*  very familiar with. And pretty soon you get good at that shit. And now you're now you're actually
*  you don't look like a complete idiot. At least you can kind of like start to, you know,
*  be familiar with that language. Yeah, I think that's in personally for me. I think that shit's
*  important. Well, it's it's important to it'll definitely make you less scared. There's one of
*  the weirdest things is watching an altercation breakout and then watching men get scared,
*  like men who don't know how to defend themselves or men that are not used to being around violence,
*  getting scared. That's right. Yeah. And that's going to happen. It's exactly like getting punched
*  in the face. If you're not boxing and getting hit. I promise you, I don't care who you are. When you
*  get hit, you just get jabbed. What you're going to do is you're going to look down and you're going
*  to bring your hands to your face. That's what you're going to do. You're going to go, oh shit,
*  or you're going to do this or that. And then you're then you're. Yeah. And it's not until
*  you really practice whatever it is that you can see and kind of, you know, I'm not saying I'm
*  there, but that's you're at least less apt to less likely to put yourself in a position of danger.
*  You know, it's exactly like with jujitsu, right? Once when you grab somebody, what do they do?
*  Like I'll grab I've grabbed boxers have never had any wrestling great boxers. They turn they turn
*  their back or like I was messing. I was showing my friend how he's a great boxer, but I was showing
*  him how vulnerable he is with even an idiot like me grabs him, grabbed him, took him to the ground
*  and I wrapped I put a body locker on his body. And what did he do? He reached down from my ankles.
*  So I went, oh, here you go. And I just want you to see what happens. It was it was anybody would do
*  that. Yeah. So well, I think it's good just to learn because it's difficult and because it tests
*  you emotionally and physically. Yeah. And and even the shooting stuff does, especially because
*  we're around these guys who are, you know, Terrence, a real world class competitive shooter,
*  and he's showing us this stuff. And then we go to do it. It looks so awkward and goofy.
*  Like when you put yourself in a situation where you suck at something, it's really good for you.
*  It's good to suck at things and try to get better at them. It's anything, whatever it is, whether
*  it's learning how to play chess, whether it's whatever it is, learning how to do something,
*  learn how to play tennis, whatever the fuck it is, when you learn how to do something,
*  you suck at it at first and you have to concentrate on getting better. That thing of getting better
*  translates to other aspects of your life. And it's a skill getting better at stuff as a skill.
*  It doesn't mean that because you're a mindset. Yeah. But it doesn't mean that because you're
*  good at archery, you'll be good at learning how to play the piano. But if you can get good at
*  learning how to play the piano, you can get good at archery. Yes, because it's there's a thing in
*  there of learning how to learn. Well, that's that's a learning how to learn a lot of times is
*  as simple as once you learn how to do one thing well, like I said, that's why one thing informs
*  the other. I think what happens is if you're in a new situation, like we were today, you get better,
*  at least I'm better at getting out of my own way. Yeah, you get better at not overthinking,
*  you get better at relaxing. It's the same. A lot of times it's the same body position. It's the same
*  weight distribution. Sometimes it's, it's very similar. Like a lot of these things have their
*  similar language, but mainly they're also a similar mindset. You just put yourself in that softer,
*  that softer beginner's mind, that idea of kind of like, you know, just, just don't just open up,
*  open your mind, and just just let it come to you. Well, it's also accepting that you don't know
*  things. A lot of men in particular are really bad at learning stuff, because they always they want
*  to think that they know already. So even when you tell them stuff, they want to think they know,
*  yeah, I got it. I got it. Problems. Well, because men are natural problem solvers. I have a joke
*  about that where I say, I don't know anything about cars, nothing. But if there's a woman on
*  the side of the road with her hood up looking at her engine, I'll make suggestions. And it's true.
*  I've done that. I'll be like, well, check the spark plug. Well, today with engines, you good luck.
*  No one knows what's going on in there. You ever see what it looks like when they open up a brand
*  new night like 992 of 2020 Porsche, the hood, pull up, opening up the hood on a 2020 Porsche.
*  It's the most ridiculous thing ever. Really? You have no idea what anything is. You have no,
*  even someone like you who knows a lot about cars. I have no idea what's in there. I have no idea.
*  You can't even see anything. You get this much of a view. Why? Oh, yeah. The view into when you open
*  up the back, there's a rear engine car, a Porsche, it was most probably one of the most sophisticated,
*  technologically advanced cars ever built, right? Because they've been refining the design since the
*  1960s. Pop up the rear trunk and look inside of the engine, or it's not trunk, it's the hood,
*  whatever. Look inside of the engine. You don't know what the fuck that is. It's two fans. You
*  see two fans. That's what you see. See two fans. What's going on there? I don't know. Better take
*  it to a place with computers. Well, you need software, right? You need software to tune it up
*  and all that shit. You have to, it's literally, they have to plug a machine into it which analyzes
*  the system. God damn. And then the machine's going, hey, this is fucked and that's fucked and this is
*  falling apart. When are they going to do that with people? Yeah. Soon. Really? Yeah. You have
*  inside info. Well, here's the problem. Once the first guy gets his legs cut off and gets awesome
*  new legs put on, then we're going to have a real problem. Because people are going to take their
*  legs off. Oh, yeah. You're going to have better legs. That'll be Joe Rogan. Better legs. I can't
*  wait till I get the call in your 80. I'm getting new legs, dude. What? Getting them cut off. I'm
*  going to buy, and you know me, I'll be like, I don't know, Joe, the science is new. And you go,
*  fuck off. Like a turkey leg. Pop. God damn it. Just pull them off and put some new ones on there.
*  Well, I mean, we were talking about this guy. Do you see any photos of it?
*  I found a video and nothing was new at all. They were really old. It's a 992 Porsche.
*  992 is the 2020 model. If 992 Porsche under the hood. It's all right. What? Am I buying a Porsche?
*  You should. Really? Please. I've been trying. I'm begging you for years. I deserve it. To buy
*  a real car. Yes. I mean, I have a Tesla. That's a real car. Yeah. That's a great car. That's new
*  for you to say. I love that car. Do you still drive your? Love it. It's right here. I drive it
*  all zone. Great car. It's the fastest thing I've ever driven by far. I have a bunch of sports cars
*  that make a lot of noises. Yeah. But they're like, they're like guys who put like fucking headbands
*  on and weight lifting belts. And then some girl who's a cross fitter goes right next to you and
*  deadlifts twice the weight. That's what the Tesla is. It's soft and subtle and twice as fast. I love
*  your whatever that is Land Cruiser. Oh yeah. It's the greatest car I've ever seen. Yeah. Does it
*  drive really well? Oh yeah. No problems. It's got a supercharged Corvette engine in it. Oh. Okay.
*  That's, that's a side section of the car though. I have no idea what the fuck that is. Yeah. See,
*  that's different because that's actually there. They cut the car in half so that you can look into
*  it. I think that's actually even an artist rendering. It's okay, Jamie. We're never going
*  to find it. Oh, far left, right there. Red, red, the red far left, left, right there. That's it.
*  That's it. That's it. That's it. That's the view. Go large with that. What? If you open up the trunk,
*  that's what you see. Come on. Yup. That's the whole thing you see under the hood. That's what
*  you see. What happened there? So forget it. So forget it. That's it. So your wrenches are no
*  good here. So imagine a girl pulls over and she's wearing cut off jean shorts and a banging booty,
*  big old squat booty. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And she's looking over and you're like,
*  I've got to help her. Let me help you. I'm, uh, I go like this. I go, what seems to be the trouble?
*  You're a captain never distracted. Is that what you said? My nickname is Brad Pitt.
*  So if you pulled over and looked at that, you don't know. Not a human being has any idea what's
*  going on. I'd say I've got the software back in my place. You should get one of those though.
*  You should get one of those. Get yourself a nice Carrera S. Oh my God. It's a marvelous car. Really?
*  Oh yeah. Super calm and quiet. They go over bumps like nothing, but yet when you hit the, like,
*  they have such a supple suspension that the suspension can, it's so, it adjusts to matter
*  what you're driving over, especially when you're in comfort mode. Expensive. Yes. It's a fucking
*  Porsche. Jesus Christ. Yes. Kind of question is that at least a hundred grand. Yes. Yeah.
*  At least a hundred grand, but you need one. I do. Right. You do. You're a bad influence on me.
*  No, I'm a good influence. Like we've been doing this forever. Okay. I've been doing it forever.
*  Imagine if you just listened to me all those times ago, you'd still be fine, but you would have had
*  this history of having amazing cars. Instead you had a fucking red Prius forever. It's a red Ram.
*  I remember that Bronco that you had. Not bad. That was pretty dope. Yeah. You had,
*  it was like a 70 Bronco. Yeah. Gave me nothing. A 71 Bronco with a 350 Windsor or something like
*  that. Yeah. Caused me nothing but problems. You know why? Because it's a piece of shit.
*  If you got a really good one, it would be awesome. I loved the car. It was a cool looking car. I
*  remember when you came to my house and I was like, I love you. Yeah. You're finally getting it. I'm
*  like, finally you're getting it. Every time I try to be different though, it's just never, you know.
*  You just never driven a Porsche. If you drove, if you drove and see, don't want one like Schaub's.
*  Schaub's got a GT2 RS. He's such an extremist. It's too loud. It bumps too loud. It's like.
*  It's his number one car. Oh yeah. Just who drives that car as their number one car. Psycho. He's out
*  of his mind. He's a psycho. I know, but it fits him. I know it's perfect for him. It's flashy. It's blue
*  and black. It's amazing. The best like that. That you don't want that color. That's gross. I like that
*  color is disgusting. Get us pull up a there's that's that Doug Demuro guy. He's a nice car.
*  That guy's a great analyst of automobiles. Like, look at that. Perfect black. Listen, this car is
*  a marvelous car. Yeah, but you know, I need something for the fucking, I need something for
*  the next pandemic. I need something to get, I gotta, I want to get an Airstream. You want a land
*  cruiser like mine. Yeah, but I need, I need something I can kind of live into. I'm going to get an
*  Airstream. Living. You want something you can get away from everybody and two, you can't get away
*  in an Airstream. You got to leave that thing there and then it becomes a liability. That's true.
*  You want something you can overland in son. Overland? Overland. That's a good idea. It's
*  a whole thing. They do. Overlanders. My land cruiser that was built by icon, the rear seat
*  comes out. So the rear seat has these, they made it for me. So there's this, you just pull these
*  levers, click, click, pull the rear seat out. You could sleep in that motherfucker. If you had to
*  cost money. Yeah, it's cost money. You want to hire artisans and craftsmen and geniuses to design
*  things and build things for you. It costs money. Maybe just regular. You want to get paid too,
*  right? Don't you want to get paid? Yeah, they do as well. Yeah. You got to pay them. Maybe a
*  regular land cruiser. Regular land cruisers are great. I'm cheap when it comes to cars. What is
*  that? Oh, that's a real overland vehicle. That looks like a Dodge Ram or a Ford F-150 or something.
*  What is that? What's that thing that's dragging behind it? Well, that's where all your shit is.
*  Yeah. You sleep in that. And then they have these rooftop tents. That's one Lowe's. Look at that.
*  Yeah, you climb in the rooftop tent. Let me see that. Let me see the one, but I want to see that
*  one. I need protection. No, you want the one to the left of your cursor, that gray looking thing,
*  right to the left. Yeah, right there. You just had it. Yeah. That's what you want. Look at that.
*  It looks so manly. Oh, that's fucking cool. It looks like a Ford F-350. That's what I need.
*  Now the problem is it's taking up a lot of gas. It's diesel. That thing probably drives pretty,
*  it probably is a huge tank. What are those three things? Is that three gas tanks? I'm guessing.
*  It might be. It might have three gas tanks. I'm a fan. Yeah. Look at that thing. I'm a fan. I
*  carry extra gas. Well, we have to think differently now, right? I agree. Press that
*  button. Let's see what this thing, look at it driving over fucking mountains and shit.
*  Look at it. So manly. Yeah. You can keep water in there. You could fucking cook food in that fucking
*  I got my weaponry. I got my hunting rifles. I got everything. He's got, oh my God, he's bouncing
*  over rocks with that thing. He's got rock sliders on that pig. That's a pig of a truck. I know.
*  Imagine trying to sleep. That's good though. Why are you driving over the mountain? I like that a
*  lot. Yeah. Those are great. But you could, like a van, there's a company called, look up this
*  company, U-joint Off-Road. Yeah, I think that's what it's called. U-joint Off-Road. And what they
*  do is they take a van, like a regular van, and they turn it, he has an Instagram page. It's pretty
*  cool. They take a regular van, like a cargo van, and turn it into like the ultimate four by four
*  vehicle. They take out all the bullshit, take out all the axles and the engines, redo everything,
*  and put like super beefy off-road suspension, off-road like live rear and front axles. I love
*  that shit. Look at that. Bam motherfucker. Drive to the moon and that bitch. Yep. So that's something
*  that normally would be like something that Amazon delivers your toothpaste in. It's big enough to
*  sleep in. Oh fuck yeah, for sure. Look at that. They did one with a school bus. They redid a school
*  bus. I need, you gotta have water. You got a lot, you got a lot of shit. There's a lot of shit. I've
*  been obsessing now. My friend Sam Soholt, he's a photographer and he films, does a lot of outdoor
*  filming and stuff. He, I've known him for years. He did a school bus. He purchased a school bus.
*  Go to Sam Soholt's Instagram page. He probably has a blog about the school bus because I mean,
*  it's an extensive build. He did it for years and he took this school bus, a regular school bus,
*  turned it into this ultimate outdoor travel vehicle that can sleep like 10 people. So he
*  has cots in it and oh, it's amazing. It's a labor of love. You and I, you and I spoke about
*  getting some land. We've done this a while back. We were talking about this with a, with a, here's
*  the thing I didn't think of it. You thought of it was very smart. You get land with a large pond
*  slash lake on it. Yes. So you can fish. So you got access to protein no matter what. Right. Then you
*  have a garden. You gotta, you gotta be able to grow. You need a well. I gotta irrigate. I need
*  a well. I gotta have my own source of water. There's Sam's thing. So look how the side pulls out.
*  Oh, that's fucking great. Turns into a wall tent. That's crazy. The side turns into a fucking wall
*  tent. Look at that shit. That's amazing. Dude, it's so dope. And he brings that thing up into
*  the back country. That's great. Yeah. Dude, it's amazing. Problem is it's a giant bus. I need
*  something a little bit more maneuverable. You don't want that. Sam's crazy, but I mean, it's
*  awesome. What about the Fiskar? What is it called? Fiskar? That's an electric car. What are you
*  talking about? No, what is it? Now I'm losing you. You're sliding back to the old way. Hold on. Oh,
*  now you're back in Venice drinking cappuccinos off a fucking expensive machine. No, no. Son of
*  a bitch. Hold on. I need, we have to go look at land, dude. Where do we do it though? Colorado
*  or Utah. Not California anywhere? No, you want to get out of here before this place slides.
*  Too many fucking fires. Not just fires. Anything can happen here. Look, we're dealing right now
*  with this pandemic. The entire country is dealing with it. Tack on a natural disaster and then
*  you're really fucked. You're really fucked. For real. For real. I know. Yeah. This is a tricky
*  place. California is tricky because it works. When it works, it's great, but it's kind of like
*  playing musical chairs. Like, you know, that fucking music is going to stop and everyone's
*  going to have to sit down. Yeah. Like, is there a chair for me? Yeah. Like, am I stuck here? Right.
*  Musical chairs might be a bad analogy, but the reality is this is unsustainable and we're basing
*  all of this on a model that really throughout human history has only been temporary. And that
*  means a model of peace and prosperity and interdependence on a level. Not technological
*  independence. I mean, Jesus Christ. And we're counting on the grid. We're counting on so many
*  factors that have never been permanent throughout human history. They haven't existed. Right? The
*  grid didn't even exist until the 20th century. Right. So in the 20th century, in the time that,
*  you know, people who are alive today, almost were alive, the whole world has shifted. And now
*  everybody lives in these electrified cities and sewage all goes through this thing and everything
*  goes into the ocean. And you're counting on so many people. So many, dude. But on the other hand,
*  there's so many pros to that. There are, but I would just like please a place I can get the fuck
*  out of and just have like, I just want to be, I don't want to be a sitting duck. My biggest fear
*  is being vulnerable. Right. Well, you remember when I moved, I moved to Boulder in 2008 for a
*  little bit. And the reason why I moved is like, I don't like this. I don't like this traffic. And
*  when my daughter was born too, I was thinking, you know what, this is a good time to start fresh.
*  Let's just go where somewhere where it's quieter and more, but ultimately that didn't work out
*  because of altitude. When my wife was pregnant with the second baby, it's like, goddamn, like
*  altitude wrecks women when they're pregnant. And we were really high. We're at 8,500 feet above sea
*  level. But now I have other friends that are saying, Hey, we need to get the fuck out of here.
*  Tom Segura was saying, we need to get the fuck out of here. Joey Diaz was saying, where are we
*  going? I was like, you tell me where we're going. I'm going, I'll go. Right. He was like, let's go
*  to Montana. Let's go to fucking Billings, Montana. We'll open up a car. I like Billings. I like
*  Billings too. We were in Billings. Yeah. Yeah. When we, we hunted the Missouri breaks. We could
*  create it. We could literally start a comedy club somewhere. Great. Oh yeah. We could like
*  Boise doesn't have a comedy club from what I understand. Uh, no boys has a club. All right.
*  So Coeur d'Alene, I don't know. Some are really nice. We could for sure do a comedy club somewhere
*  or move to a place like salt lake that has comedy clubs and a hundred thousand fucking people or
*  whatever they have out there. But the idea of staying here just seems so silly. It seems so
*  silly. Especially while you're still in show business, you're still sucking on the tit of
*  the devil. Yes, I am. You've got the devil's nipple in your mouth. You're still going to red
*  carpets. I've also got the fighter in the kid. We're not getting Shob to move anywhere because
*  Shob would be like, you pussies. He says that. Yeah. All it would take is one more of these things.
*  Shob would be like, yeah, Denver's not bad. Yeah. You could live in evergreen. You're 30 minutes
*  from Denver. Yeah. How about that? I'll do that. Evergreen. Would you? Is that nice? Fuck yeah.
*  Evergreen's gorgeous. Pull up evergreen. I got it. I got my kids. Evergreen right now are angry at me.
*  Shut up. You're going to fucking wreck evergreen. Evergreen is beautiful. It's 30 minutes from
*  Denver and it's a beautiful mountain town. Here I go. 9,000 people, 9,500, all our friends.
*  Imagine. But we're all funny. We start a comedy club in evergreen. Great idea.
*  Just get Wendy involved. Wendy from the comedy works. That's what it looks like. I love Wendy.
*  Bro, it's gorgeous. It's got a beautiful historic. Look at that. That's what I'm talking about,
*  Brian Callan. Dude. Woods. Elk herds wander through town. You whack one of them. You eat it for six
*  months. And I want two German shepherds working. Look at that. Pull that fucking historic downtown
*  evergreen. That's the lake. I've been to that before. There's a lake and people go ice skating
*  on the lake. It's fucking beautiful up there. Dude, that's what I want to do. My kids will ice skate.
*  You know the South Park guys? Matt, Stone, and Trey Parker, they're from evergreen.
*  That's what South Park is based on. It's part of it's based on, that's why there's always snow in
*  South Park. It's based on evergreen Colorado. Those guys are from there. It's gorgeous out there.
*  They're going to get mad at you if you keep talking about it. Sorry. There's other places in Colorado,
*  but there's other places in Utah. Park City's amazing. I love Park City. Park City's great.
*  My parents were tired there. Gorgeous. Good move. Great restaurants, beautiful scenery.
*  You're still dependent on the grid and there's not enough water. I don't trust it. Well, there is
*  actually. Get some water. Doesn't trust it. We'd be fine. We'd kill some elk. Yes. But I need fucking
*  rice and oatmeal. I need some starch. You need rice and oatmeal? I need some yams. Why do you need
*  rice and oatmeal? You can grow yams. You can grow those things. You need a lot of water. They grow.
*  You grow them in the ground. Yeah, but there's not a drought in Utah. It's not like it's a fucking.
*  There's a reason why there's so much snow, Brian. That's precipitation. That's water. Wait, you can melt snow,
*  can't you? Fuck. But it's coming down. It snows. Well, guess what? It also rains. That's true.
*  Yeah. You can grow things there. You see all those trees? Yeah, they use water. Whenever you see a
*  lot of woods, assume there's water. Yeah, probably. Right? Yeah. I would imagine. Crazy. Maybe I should
*  do some thinking. Look at that. Look how pretty his ass. Where's that, Jamie? I don't know, but it's a big
*  giant lake. God, it's so beautiful. I need a lake. I need a lake for water. Is that Colorado? Is it says?
*  It's Evergreen Photos. It's probably somewhere in there. God, that's in Evergreen? Dude, I want to be able to live off the land.
*  Livability. Click on that. What does it say about livability? Don't come here, ass fucks.
*  Evergreen, Colorado. What you need to know. Here it goes. Looking to move to Evergreen, Colorado?
*  We've got everything you want to know about the key factors that can make it the best place for you,
*  including Evergreen, Colorado real estate. Let's start with the basics. Evergreen, Colorado is
*  located in Jefferson County, has a population of 8,688 people. That's a show.
*  That's one show at a good-sized theater. So true. Yeah. That's one show. That's not even a sold-out arena.
*  Oh my God. We have a cool graph below that shows the city's ethnic diversity. None. I'll check that
*  graph right now. Zero. It's all white people. There's one black guy and they walk and watch him closely.
*  What kind of ethnic diversity? Let me see the graph. Evergreen. Let me see their graph.
*  Let me see the graph about the diversity. This is a graph. They hide the graph. Salt Lake has a lot of
*  Tongan and Samoan. Salt Lake, the city, is surprisingly diverse. I have a friend who
*  moved there. Medium household income, 79 grand. Nice. 389 grand for a house. Nice. Population,
*  8,688. So it doesn't have a diversity graph. They probably ditched that. One thing is like,
*  hey, delete that. Oh, what does it say? Okay. It says ages. Does it say ethnicity? White. 97.5%.
*  Well, there you go, ladies and gentlemen. 1.4% Asian.
*  Literally no black people. There's one black person.
*  0.1% ethnicity. Other. Other. It doesn't even say black. It says other. African Americans,
*  one of the most prominent races in this country. And there it's other.
*  Go back to that. Stop scrolling. Look at that. That is crazy. 97.5% white. Dude,
*  30 minutes to Denver, huh? Yeah. Fuck. 30 minutes to Denver. I want to go to Evergreen. But
*  you will get snowed in, bro. You will. Oh, yeah. Is it high elevation? What's the elevation? 8,000
*  feet. That's a little high. It's high as fuck. And you're going to get snowed in. It's not just
*  snowed in, but like several feet of snow. Little problem for me. Like you ain't going nowhere,
*  bitch. Little problem. Is it really? Don't you just get a snow blower? Like a goddamn man?
*  Well. You put on a, like, get a beaver hat. Get Ronella to make you a beaver hat. Yes, yes. Like
*  one of them real hats. Yes. Like the mountain man type hats. I want a coyote, full length coyote.
*  No. I know it's mean. I never was a coyote. They're too much like dogs. You mean you want a
*  coyote jacket or something? Yes. I mean, I know it's cruel and I don't want to kill coyotes,
*  but they are very plentiful. These idiots are thinking about moving wolves into Colorado.
*  They're talking about doing that. That's not a bad idea, right? Didn't moving wolves into Yellowstone
*  increase the population of everything? No. No, it did not. Is that a lie? No. Yes, it is. It is.
*  Oh yeah. The wolves changed rivers. Yes. Yeah. A lot of other factors that that guy didn't take
*  into consideration in terms of moving rivers. One of the things was beavers. They imported beavers
*  into Yellowstone. There's many, many factors, but they did reduce the undulate population,
*  which you could say was out of proportion. What's an undulate? Undulate is cows, elks,
*  you know cows. Yeah. Ruminants, you know, animals, ruminants, ruminants, yeah, animals that,
*  ruminants, ruminants, whatever it is. I like saying ruminant. Yeah. The animals that you hunt,
*  deer and elk, and guess who else hunts them? Wolves, bitch. Yeah. So it changed the way the
*  elk behave. It reduced the population pretty substantially, but there's still a healthy
*  population of elk in Montana and there's a healthy population of wolves and they actually hunt wolves
*  now. They hunt wolves in Idaho. They hunt a lot of wolves. In some places they're trying to resist
*  the hunting of wolves, but you got to kind of keep a balance and if you're going to bring predators,
*  you got to realize why they killed them all in the first place. They killed them all in the first
*  place because ranchers were losing all of their crops or all their cattle rather. Look, I love
*  wolves. Look, you can see I have pictures of wolves all over my wall out there. I'm a huge fan of
*  wolves, but I also am a big fan of wildlife biologists and the wildlife biologists that
*  understand balance, the real ones, not the ones that are animal activists that only want animals
*  to live and they only want everybody to eat tofu. The ones that understand that there's a balance
*  from predators and prey and we miss that balance. That's why there's no mountain lion hunting in
*  California and people say, well, that's a good thing, sort of, but mountain lions are still
*  getting killed in California. This is what we don't understand. Mountain lions get killed by
*  state and federal agents who have to kill mountain lions because mountain lions are killing
*  either people's dogs or cats or livestock all the time. They kill the same amount of mountain
*  lions they would if they had tags. Really? Yes, but the difference is the money doesn't go to the
*  state, but everybody feels good and the government feels warm and cuddly. Because somebody with a
*  uniform is doing it. They're doing it on the sneak tip instead of like some guy posing on Instagram
*  like hugging. You ever see the way they pose with mountain lions? It's kind of fucked up. They hold
*  them up in the air to hug them. It's weird. They do that with wolves. Yeah, let you know how big
*  they are. It's fucking huge. Let you know what a man they are that they shot this. Mountain lion's
*  delicious, by the way. It is? According to everybody I know. Well, Renell told me it's pretty tough.
*  No, no, no. No, somebody said, he said it's superb. That's his words. He said superb. He goes it's
*  like a superior pork. No. Yes, but they eat their 100% carnivores. Yeah, and supposedly delicious.
*  I can't think of any other animal we eat. Do we eat any animals that are total carnivores? Alligator?
*  Yes, alligator is delicious. Fish? Yeah, fish are 100% carnivores, but they're not really, no,
*  it's a thing. But what else animal wise? You don't eat any birds that are carnivores, but birds will
*  eat. That is interesting, right? Yeah. Like we don't eat eagles. Well, in the Old Testament,
*  if you're a kosher Jew or if you're Islamic, if you're Muslim, you're not to eat things like
*  eagles, osprey, but there was a very good scientific reason for that. Because you would get different
*  pathogens. Oh, for sure. Anything that eats, live animals. But chickens eat, they live on mealworm
*  and they'll eat all kinds of shit. That's true. But you're also supposed to cook chicken past 145
*  degrees. Because you're killing off parasites and salmonella and all kinds of other shit.
*  People eat raw chicken. You got to be out of your fucking mind to eat raw chicken.
*  Docs, you know what a horse will eat a chicken sometimes? Really? Uh huh. There's a video of it.
*  Whoa. I know cows eat birds. I didn't know a horse ate a chicken. Bring up that video of a
*  horse eating a fucking chicken. Thank you. Thank you for doing this. And deer will eat.
*  Oh, I've seen a lot of deer eating birds. They'll eat birds. I need that protein. Yeah,
*  there was a net that they use to catch birds. They set up this net. I think they were studying
*  birds and it's a humane way to catch them. They get captured in this net and they can release them
*  from the net gently and then they could set them free. Uh uh. Deer would just find them in the net
*  and eat them. God damn. Yeah, they just pluck them right out of the net. So interesting. Cattle too.
*  They'd know the net where the net was. Like, oh, wonderful. Really? Now they'll chase these birds.
*  Choo, choo, choo. Yeah. Here's a cow eating one too. We've played the horse before too.
*  Oh, a cow eating a chicken? Play that. It's a horse eating one. Okay, here we go. There's a
*  chicken running around. Oh, here's a chicken. Oh, he's feeding? I'm just saying it almost looks
*  like it. Really? Well, yeah, he's filming it. Horses don't fuck around. Oh, it's a little baby
*  chick. Yeah, look, he's chasing that chick down. Oh, I'm looking out for you. That's so interesting.
*  That's a rat, bitch. Chompa, chompa, chompa. No. Yeah, they just recognize it's protein.
*  Yeah, my uh. Wow, he ate that quick. I used to have a pit bull. Patty's pit bull. Chauncey badass
*  dog. I remember Chauncey. Oh, loved that dog. A great dog. Like an alligator. Like jaws on fucking,
*  just with feet. There's a cow eating a chicken. Jesus Christ. Chewing it apart. Oh my goodness.
*  She got near a big horse, a Clydesdale. That horse put its head down and ran straight at that
*  fucking dog. And Chauncey was like, oh fuck, yeah. The size of a Clydesdale. He was like,
*  get the fuck out of my corral. What are you doing? He literally stopped and he went, really? Put his
*  head down and went and came. I thought she was going to die. She just dodged out of the way.
*  She could have. There's a horrible video of this guy is uh. What is it called when you got a bunch
*  of dogs pulling you? Is it called mushing? Yeah, mushing. I did rod. Yeah. Mushing? Mushing.
*  Mushing or mushing? I mush. Do you mush or do you mush? I mush personally. Okay. So this
*  guy, it's really sad. This guy is getting pulled by these dogs and this moose runs in front of him
*  and just starts stomping his dogs. What? Yeah, it's terrible. It's terrible. There's nothing
*  you can do about it. There it is. No. So this is not it. This is not it, but I'm sure this is
*  probably a similar result. The other one was a cow moose. It was either a cow moose or it was.
*  That one. I thought he was just clearing the path for him. It said. Well, they will they will
*  fuck up dogs. Moose attack sled dog team. 1990s. Yeah, that's not it. It's a recent one, but it's
*  it's real. Anyway, it was real sad. I saw it on Instagram. It killed a bunch of dogs. It killed
*  a couple of them. One of them they had to put down after the fact because it broke its back. Damn.
*  Yeah, I mean a Milton moose is an 1800 pound animal. Not hearing a peep out of a pack of dogs.
*  Pack of dogs. That's like you get in a fight with a hamster. Yeah. Just get the fuck out of here.
*  Moose are so big, man. Couple cheetah pull them down. The cheetah will grab your balls,
*  eat your balls first. Whoa. Then hamstring you. You know they do that.
*  Wolves do that too. Lions do that. Lions will do that with a water buffalo. They'll attack the legs.
*  Oh, they'll eat the at. They'll eat your balls. They'll take your balls and start to bleed out.
*  I'll take your balls, please. How can you protect your balls?
*  Oh, yeah. It's a stupid design, right? Yeah. Just pull it up inside like a turtle.
*  Tanks. They're just tanks, but sometimes they get tired. Yeah. If you go hunting,
*  you should have a steel cup like a tie cup. Yes. One that goes through the butt like a G string.
*  I do anyway. You should. I call that discipline.
*  Some wolf wants to try to bite your balls. He gets a mouthful of metal.
*  I tie my dick down on my leg with a hemp rope just to keep me honest.
*  A hemp rope? Yeah. Keep me honest.
*  And also organic. Yeah. Brian, what are you doing?
*  Tying my dick down with a coarse hemp rope. Why?
*  To keep me honest. Yeah. Like, you know, those side
*  holsters that people have sometimes where they have a strap on their thigh because they have a
*  long gun and they want to keep it from flopping up against their thigh. Sure do.
*  As you do with the hog. That's right.
*  Sometimes I sprint with a hard on. You ever try that naked?
*  I've never run with a hard on. Me neither.
*  It's amazing. I've lived all these years. Never ran with a hard on.
*  I wonder how long your dick would stay hard if you were in a full gallop.
*  It's a good question. It's a very good question.
*  That'd be a great contest. Right.
*  If someone broke into your house and you were in the middle of sex and you were angry,
*  but you kept your wood because you weren't scared.
*  Just get your dick super hard and just go run.
*  Just take a hair tie and just rubber band it to the bottom.
*  Got to do that. Just keep the blood flow.
*  Got to tie your piece down. Oh yeah. You tie off at the end.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a cock ring. That's right.
*  And then just go running after them. Just use a cock ring.
*  With a big old hard on. Yeah, but who has a cock ring?
*  Ah, fuck. That's one of those things.
*  If you have it, what's wrong with you? Don't say that because you're going to
*  get 50 emails of people with alligator cock rings.
*  And I'll initial it for you. Hey bro, there's nothing wrong with cock rings.
*  Joe Rogan fucking experience. Let me show you how I make them.
*  Just a cock ring. You got python?
*  Yeah. Python cock ring?
*  So many cock rings. They all exist.
*  Yeah, like who's buying sex toys from stores these days?
*  You ever drive by one of them sex toy stores and you're like, for real?
*  It's a ghost town. Who's in there?
*  They're open still. The hustler store.
*  Money laundering operations?
*  Maybe, but the hustler store is still open I think on Sunset Boulevard.
*  Is it? That's more of a thing
*  for you and your girlfriend to go in like, let's get this.
*  Well, it used to be DVDs. I remember it used to be like,
*  you remember when people used to buy porn DVDs?
*  There was a day, you fucking kids today are so spoiled.
*  NVHS porn. Oh yeah. Oh, I remember that.
*  That was when I used to watch porn. You know, I never, and this is all bullshit aside,
*  and I'm not because I'm a good boy. I never watched porn.
*  I never ever watched porn because it doesn't do a thing for me.
*  Really? I don't know what it is.
*  I just, I swear to God. Because you're tired.
*  I thought about that the other day. I was like, I haven't watched porn in
*  Three days?
*  Since I was 52. I haven't watched porn in so many years.
*  Because you're tired from all your fucking.
*  Yeah, all my banging. Because I fuck.
*  Oh, you're fucking. Because I fuck.
*  Porn is an oddly polarizing subject because it's one of the weirdest things ever if you
*  really stop and think about it. Because mostly everyone who's healthy enjoys sex,
*  whether it's straight sex or gay sex or what kind of sex you like.
*  If you're healthy and you're young, even if you're not young, if you're healthy,
*  your body works well. You like sex, but yet filming it.
*  Yeah. It's so taboo.
*  I know. I think it's because. So taboo.
*  It is taboo. And I thought a lot about that. I think it's because we inherently know,
*  typically that the person doing it, putting themselves on camera, it is a form of suicide.
*  What I mean by that is it's a form of, it's a way of ensuring that you keep yourself out of
*  certain segments of society. And maybe it's residue from when sex was downright dangerous,
*  pregnancy, disease that we didn't have cures for. I think sex had to have a lot of taboos.
*  Even in the Old Testament, I think when the Israelites were not allowed to,
*  you couldn't take the women as slaves, you had to kill everybody. Well, the reason for that was,
*  unless they were virgins, because the reason for that was you could get a disease.
*  I can't remember who broke that down, but that was always a thing where
*  people would get, you'd go into a town and rape all the women and stuff. And then your soldiers
*  would come down with some terrible syphilitic disease. And so in the Old Testament, the
*  Israelites were forbidden from taking anybody who was of a certain age. That's another weird
*  thing about sex, the diseases. Like how many goddamn diseases come from fucking? And people
*  seem fine. That's the thing. It's not like the flu or, you know, like if someone's like, oh my
*  God, I have a fever. Can we fuck? It's not like that. I got the flu from Maggie. That dirty bitch.
*  Like wait, bro, she was in bed. She was sick. You couldn't tell she was sick? Oh, I thought I'd be
*  fine. Like no. When I was younger, if you had a flu, I wasn't going to stop me. But I'm sick,
*  I can't. I'd be like, I don't give a fuck. Because you're terrible. But that's not my point. My point
*  is people seem fine and they have a terrible disease. It's so weird. Like the flu is normal.
*  Like you're sick. You got a temperature. Oh, I don't want to be near you. I could catch that
*  disease. But that's one of the weird things about this coronavirus in a lot of ways, right?
*  Because they said, we were trying to figure out what the number is, but there's a large percentage,
*  more than half are asymptomatic. But they're carrying it. So like they seem fine, but they're
*  spreading this horrible disease. That's weird. But that's sort of like some diseases, some VD,
*  some of the clap. Yes. Herpes. You can have herpes and never show symptoms. So you can have herpes
*  simplex too and never show symptoms. And you could be carrying it. Just shooting herpes,
*  ridden loads into people. And apparently all of us have been exposed to herpes. And if you get
*  cold source from, I understand, on your lips, you have somewhat some immunity to the one on your
*  genitals. But you could transfer the ones from your lips to your nose. Apparently you can't.
*  It's such a weird thing. You can't fix that one. They don't have a vaccine for herpes. No,
*  they just have pills you can take. They never figured that out. I think they were working on it.
*  There's too many people with herpes that just let it go. It's some crazy number.
*  It's like warts too. There are different kinds of warts.
*  Well, they have that now. HPV, they do have a vaccine for that. They do have a vaccine for
*  that. And that's very important for women because women get cervical cancer. It's just the idea that
*  all these diseases are passed on through sex is so strange. Well, if you think about it, you're
*  coming in as close contact as is possible. You're ingesting their fluids.
*  When I come, I like to run into the bathroom. And clean immediately.
*  I just shoot into the sink. Yeah, man. It's hard to... Yeah, but porn,
*  we were talking about porn. Why is there taboo? Typically, I think it's because people... I think
*  it's a couple of things. I think porn people remind us of a darker animalistic side of ourselves we
*  don't want to admit to. So if I watch porn, I'm not going to admit that to a bunch of people I
*  don't know yet. There's something shaming about watching other people have sex. There's something
*  taboo about that. So if I admit... So if I'm around somebody who reminds me of the fact that I...
*  That's why I've always thought it would be the height of hypocrisy. Whenever people judge porn
*  stars, it's like you judge porn stars. You watch porn. Porn is a multi-billion dollar industry.
*  Let's be honest. All of us watch it. All of us jerk off to it. I did. I did my share of it.
*  But you stopped a week ago. My father one time looked at my iPad and he goes,
*  the fuck is this porn, porn? What is it? My search history was so full of sin.
*  Your dad was looking through your search? He was trying to... He put something in.
*  He was snooping. No. And he saw this. He goes, what is all this? I go,
*  I go look. I looked at him. I went, I watched porn. He went like this.
*  And he went on to... He was looking for something.
*  You just really get uncomfortable with them. What is your favorite to watch?
*  Exactly. I don't listen. I'm sure he does too. I'm sure everybody does. But here's the thing.
*  When you're in a presence of porn people, typically if they're part of your crew,
*  they remind people of sort of their darker side. And I think that's why they become... Also,
*  by the way though, the kind of person that's willing to do that might be more self-destructive
*  usually than the average person in that sense. Yeah, I guess.
*  I don't know. Yeah. I mean, you always have to leave the door open to aberrations.
*  But there was something that I read about... It was a real bummer. The number of women that
*  get into porn that have been sexually molested is off the charts.
*  Although I've met... I'm thinking of two in particular. Alana Evans, who I got to know,
*  who is as normal and as cool a fucking human being as it gets. She's just... I love her.
*  She's a great person. She just is. And Asa Akira. Asa is smart as fuck and a regular... I kept
*  looking at her going, what's going on here? She's read everything. She just seems incredibly
*  well-adjusted, but she has that side of her. So I don't know.
*  She does ferocious gangbangs. Yes.
*  Where it's like all her mascara is gone. Correct.
*  She's covered in cocksnot. Never watched one of her porns, but yes.
*  Congratulations. Yeah.
*  Because you respect her. No. I just...
*  You're not into Asa Akira. I just haven't watched it. I got it. Maybe I will now.
*  Maybe that'll break your three-day fast. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, I don't know.
*  It's a weird one because it is sort of universally taboo, but yet almost universally consumed.
*  These are very contradictory things. It is.
*  Very much. Nicole Aniston, Stevie Blue Eyes,
*  my boy, you know Stevie, he dates Nicole Aniston and now does porn with her.
*  No. Yeah.
*  Oh yeah. What? When did this happen?
*  Stevie goes from crime to stand-up to porn.
*  He's doing porn with Nicole Aniston. With his girlfriend.
*  With his girlfriend. She's a beautiful girl.
*  She's a beautiful girl. And again, very good businesswoman, has other investments.
*  You talk to her and she's gorgeous, but you'd never think...
*  I've had long, lucid conversations with this person. She's just not...
*  It just doesn't make... So Stevie's showing his cock to the world.
*  Stevie's got a fucking piece on him. Got a piece on him?
*  Ha ha ha ha. Are you fucking kidding me? Does he call himself Stevie Blue Eyes in his porn?
*  I don't think so. I don't know.
*  Do you still let him open for you or is he tainted now?
*  I want to. No, I'd fucking... I love that guy.
*  Even after he does porn, people see his heart.
*  I don't give a fuck. You should be careful.
*  He's hilarious. I don't give a shit.
*  This is not good. This is not good.
*  It's a bad look. No, Stevie's always welcome.
*  You're a guy on television. You can't have some porn star open for you.
*  Definitely. Now I want him. I want to be more now.
*  My... I use Malik B. He should be a director.
*  I use Malik B. He's amazing.
*  You should be a director and come in and dressed like an old-timey director.
*  How's an old-timey director dress? Think about that.
*  I would dress the way an old-time French director dresses, which would be I would have knickers,
*  I would have boots, I'd have a beret, and I'd have a cane.
*  Cane. Like a cattle, like a riding crop.
*  Yes. A fucking riding crop. So be dressed like an equestrian,
*  but I'm not an equestrian. Like an equestrian. Yes.
*  And maybe even have, instead of a beret, a hard riding hat.
*  Yes. And action.
*  Action. And scene.
*  Why don't they... Could they talk you into doing something where you don't have sex,
*  but you are comedic relief in a porn film? Would you be interested in doing that?
*  I would do that. Would you?
*  Probably. Would ABC get mad at you?
*  Oh, you want ABC? Yeah, I'm on ABC.
*  ABC's very conservative. Yeah. Well, they're owned by Disney.
*  Yeah. But then again, hopefully they don't listen to The Fighter and Kid.
*  Well, hopefully they don't listen to this. Because we're trying to set it up.
*  Action. I had a director one time. I was doing a scene and he goes,
*  I don't believe you. He said, I don't believe you.
*  I don't believe you. Brian, I don't believe you.
*  Was that Sex and the City? No, it was on MADtv.
*  Really? A director on MADtv is taking you seriously?
*  I had a director on Oz say that. He goes, I can see you acting. He whispered,
*  hey, I can see you acting. Try something different.
*  Whoa. Try something different.
*  Yeah. He was right. Well, you are acting.
*  You should play dumb. I don't know what you're saying. I'm supposed to be acting, right?
*  If you don't want me to act, I'll go home. What?
*  You should have focused on stand-up. Yes.
*  Well, you did eventually. I love it.
*  But you like to acting too. You're a weirdo. You like those people too. You secretly like
*  those acting people. The ones that I disdain. I don't know about that.
*  You bring them around sometimes and I get grossed out.
*  I don't know if that's true. I have to slowly make my way to the door.
*  I don't think I brought any actors around. You don't anymore.
*  How long ago? It's been a while.
*  You used to bring them around. Yeah.
*  And I used to be like, hey, what the fuck is this? Who's this guy?
*  I'm not comfortable on this guy. The guy would be right there.
*  I don't want to be rude. I don't like this guy.
*  Bro, but you would bring the worst, full-on liars, sociopaths, complete pathological liars.
*  I collected misfits. But they would just lie about stuff.
*  Maybe they were just nervous around you. But they would just make up stories though.
*  You can't do that. You can't just make up stories.
*  No, you can't. And you know, someone makes up a story
*  and it's so obvious. You're like, what are you saying?
*  But I would never pick up on it and you would go like this.
*  I remember one time you and I were doing some, we were shooting something as a favor
*  and we're getting our makeup and this guy was talking and he was dating,
*  he was actually dating some porn chick. And you were listening to him and in front of everybody,
*  in front of him and everybody, you went like this, you went, holy shit, what a bullshit artist.
*  Wow. You're a real bullshit artist, huh? And it got all weird in the room. I was like,
*  here goes Joe. Here goes Joe hunkering down. Well, when someone starts lying to you,
*  just lying to you in front of a bunch of people. And I think I remember this story.
*  I think the guy was very criminal too. It was something like, he was angling
*  to get something out of us and lying. I was like, I know where this is going.
*  You're trying to get something out of us and you're lying. Like you're a bullshit artist.
*  Yes. And I was like, we're stopping this right now because you're going to dominate this whole day
*  and then you're going to want us to invest in something or give you money. There was some,
*  there was some hustle. You stopped him right away.
*  Yeah. Well, there was some gross sort of semi-aggressive hustle to what he was doing
*  and he was lying to us. And I was like, this isn't true. Yes. But you called him on it.
*  Record scratch. It was great.
*  Well, it was one of those moments where this whole day could go to shit
*  because we're trapped in this building with this liar.
*  Right. There's so many of them out here.
*  That's so good to know. I don't have that antenna because I just trust people immediately.
*  That was an obvious one. I remember that one.
*  That was obvious. That was obvious.
*  It was a criminal one. There's some guys that are like, they're criminals.
*  Sociopaths.
*  Yeah, but they're angling. And if you don't stop it right there, they're going to get your number,
*  they're going to get your email, they're going to get you this, they're going to get you this.
*  I want to make this meeting. I'm real tight friends with Tom Cruise or this guy or that guy.
*  And it's always that. Like name dropping.
*  Has that ever worked? Does that work?
*  No.
*  That's the weirdest. Name dropping is one of the weirdest things that people do that doesn't work.
*  Yeah, it's so sad and strange.
*  But it doesn't work.
*  No.
*  But yet people do it. It's a weird one. Right?
*  Like fame by association.
*  Yep. It never works.
*  It never works.
*  Yeah. But people do it. And then when people are like, yeah, I'm real good friends with Leo.
*  I don't want to be that guy. That's the other. I don't want to be, all due respect,
*  I don't want to be the good friend to the big celebrity.
*  You do something completely different, you know, unless you do something that's completely outside
*  of business.
*  If you don't need that person, if you're not part of their entourage.
*  Yeah, like maybe David Sinclair talks about who's friends with you. That kind of thing.
*  Yeah.
*  I know Brian Callan. I'm friends with him.
*  I like that.
*  People are like, oh, well, you're a respected Harvard psychologist or biologist.
*  Well, I got very excited when Lex Friedman came to my show. And I mean, yeah, he's a fucking
*  brain scientist, a legitimate genius.
*  Yeah. And a black belt and judo and jiu-jitsu.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Great guy. But that is, that's different. That's someone who's accomplished
*  in a different realm. It's the people that are in that business that are like trying to be
*  producers or trying to be a this or trying to be a that. It's like, there's so much weirdness
*  going on out here in terms of like people being inauthentic.
*  Did I tell you the story about how I was in Boston at the Wilbur and then we went to this club,
*  I tell you, where there were these three Ethiopian guys and my buddy's girlfriend's Ethiopian.
*  Did I tell you the story?
*  I don't think so.
*  Oh, so I'm with Lex Friedman, black belt. I'm with my other boy, Rob, who's a black belt,
*  6'4", 230. I'm with Brian Cooley, who owns Gracie Baja in fucking Nashville. He's 6'6", 270?
*  Yeah. 6'6", 270. A Viking, a fucking Viking.
*  Wears his hair in a ponytail, blonde, giant, 42 years old and still competes in Jiu-Jitsu.
*  Then I got my boy, Malik B, who came out of Mayweather's camp, boxed at Wildcard forever.
*  He's been throwing her right hands since he was seven. Malik has this Ethiopian girlfriend.
*  They're these four little Ethiopian dudes who are drunk and being shitheads and actually kind
*  of dancing with the girls that are in the group. They had to be pushed away a couple of times.
*  Finally, the guy comes up to Malik and says, that girl belongs to us because she's our sister
*  and you. Malik's black, but he's fucking from Louisiana.
*  Malik, who's been fighting his life, goes, well, I think it's not Jesus. He didn't say anything.
*  He's just too happy. He just goes, whatever. I go, what'd he say? I go, what are you saying to us?
*  The guy goes, that's our sister. She shouldn't be with you guys. She's with us.
*  The Ethiopian girl, Helena, goes, you're being disrespectful. Brian Cooley said, they don't know
*  that they're surrounded by literally four black belts, a great boxer, and then me, the idiot,
*  the loudmouth, who's probably going to be the first guy to throw a punch because I'm insecure.
*  We're all there. These four guys who are maybe five, seven, never done a sport in their life.
*  Brian Cooley just looks down and the guy goes, hey, bro, you know the movie Jaws?
*  Jaws? The guy goes, huh? He goes, the movie Jaws, you know that movie? The guy goes, yeah. He goes,
*  right now in this scenario, you're the girl. You guys are the girl swimming in the water.
*  You understand? You're swimming in the water and you got no idea. You're about to be pulled under.
*  Do you understand what I'm saying? He's just giant looking down on him. Then you see the
*  Ethiopian guy go, and he sees the circle kind of tightening and he just looks at everybody. He
*  just goes like this. He goes, oh, gives a double thumbs up. At least he's smart. Oh, fuck yeah.
*  Then this man's like, oh, and they were trying to, and just kind of moved away in a group.
*  It would have been so bad for them. Men and egos. So bad for them. That's a greatest metaphor. You
*  know the fucking movie Jaws? Well, that's John Jock's metaphor. Oh, it is? Yeah, John Jock's
*  metaphor for Jiu Jitsu. Oh, fuck. Yeah. He said, the ground is the ocean and I'm a shark and most
*  people can't swim. You know, I train with Higgin. Oh, he's great. Oh, the best. He's got some very
*  controversial system where he's teaching people, celebrities, Jiu Jitsu and giving them belts,
*  but they don't really spar. Well, they're celebrities. I will always spar. Here's the
*  thing. He teaches me. He taught me a lot of Greco, like Greco stuff, which was really cool.
*  I love that shit. Higgin's a beast, man. Oh my God. In 2003 in Abu Dhabi, I was doing time for him in
*  Sao Paulo. I was holding the time. He yelled out, tell me how much time? Because he wasn't in the
*  best shape. So he would like conserve his energy. Of course. He's just so technical. He could get
*  away with, you know, beating like really good guys without being in tip top condition. I'm sure. You
*  ever see the video of him rolling with Hickson, fighting with Hickson? No. Yeah. There's a famous
*  Jiu Jitsu film. It's in black and white and it's probably from shit, 89 or 1990 or some shit,
*  like pre UFC. And they're in Rio and at a Jiu Jitsu, a Jiu Jitsu tournament back when there was no
*  Jiu Jitsu. Here's what year is this? Higgin had, what does it say? Higgin had 360. Jamie, it just
*  said 86. 86. Look at this. 86, man. So this is like when I was just getting out of high school.
*  Wow. That's Hickson on the bottom. Higgin on top. Look at how relaxed he is. Dude, they had a battle.
*  Higgin at the time was a fucking beast. Higgin's way bigger than Hickson, by the way. He is. He is.
*  He is. And this is a real battle. It's a really interesting match to watch as well because they're
*  both so technical. Higgin studied so many other things. He was an amateur boxer for a long time
*  and then he, but he did a lot of wrestling with guys. He rolled to try to get Hickson's back. He
*  keeps getting Hickson's back, but he gets shook off. Oh shit. He rolls him over. Yeah. Higgin was a
*  big fella. Yeah. Big and strong. 210 to 20. Look at this though. Hickson on top. Wow. Hickson rolled
*  him. I mean these guys, they really went for it too. This was a really wild sort of a match,
*  with a lot of scrambles. I didn't know this. Yeah, you should watch it. It's really interesting. I
*  didn't know it was 86. I would have guessed it was 90 or 91. Now the game has changed so much since,
*  right? It has. But not fundamentals. Yes, but the guys who have exceptionally sharp fundamentals
*  still dominate like Hodger Gracie. Hodger's never been a guy who adopts the new aspects. Look at
*  that beautiful sweep by Higgin, but Hickson countered. Hodger's never been a guy who adopted
*  a lot of the crazy new techniques. Hodger's like, Roger Gracie is all, I don't know, actually he
*  calls himself Roger or Hodger, I'm not sure. But he's like straight up old school arm bar, pass,
*  triangle. Just that system of fundamentals. Yeah, the fundamentals are a good way to say it.
*  If you watch really good wrestlers, they do the same, like high level wrestlers, they're still
*  doing ankle picks, they're still controlling the head and the hips, they're still doubling single
*  legging. Well, John Jacques has a way of talking about it. He said, the more Jiu-Jitsu I know,
*  the less I use. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. I use like five things. Yeah. Yeah. And it's timing. Yeah. Did
*  you ever see when John Jacques first started competing in Abu Dhabi? He was one of the first
*  gi champions to do no gi and be really successful because John Jacques was born with a genetic
*  deficiency in his left hand. He doesn't have a left hand, he just has a thumb. Right. And so
*  because of that, he never relied on grabbing things. He never relied on grabbing the gi.
*  He relied on a more Greco-Roman based style of underhooks and underhooks. So when he would roll
*  with those guys, it's like, good, there's nothing to grab. I never grabbed anything anyway. Wow.
*  And so he would just dominate people. Even guys like Sakurai, who's a top level MMA guy, just
*  fucking ran through him. Sakurai. Sakurai. Hayato Sakurai, who was like a beast back in the day.
*  Yeah. He ran right through him. He ran right through a bunch of guys. So cool. Yeah. And it's,
*  you know, those guys that do that style, like John Jacques style is the same way, man. He's never
*  been like a guy who does a lot of wild, fancy stuff. Yeah. But there's a lot of guys who do
*  wild, fancy stuff that are like super successful with that too. Look, there are great boxers,
*  great boxers that use ones and twos the whole fucking fight. Oh yeah. They might throw two
*  hooks. Yeah. So I mean, you know, just finding something. What's that Bruce Lee expression?
*  Don't beware of the man who knows 10,000 techniques. Beware of the man who knows one
*  thing that he's practiced 10,000 times. Well, it's like the book of five rings. Miumutamatsashi talks
*  about like the practicing real sword fighting literally is reaching and you have time for one
*  strike. Yeah. Like shpap. And that's what he would practice over and over. Yeah. I mean,
*  there's not, he said very rarely does ever a fight, a sword fight go to a duel, like a ching,
*  ching, ching. That doesn't happen. And that shit is like, it's final. Well, Miumutamatsashi fought
*  so many people he'd get bored and he started fighting people with oars. What? Yeah. He made
*  wooden swords out of oars and he would fight people with oars. Well, he had a famous school
*  where they would practice like, you know, where it was basically as realistic practices you get.
*  Yeah. He said the only way to practice for that is that mindset. God damn. Imagine realistic
*  practice with swords. He would do things like get you like if you were about to think he would
*  turn you toward the sun. So the sun was in your eyes. Yeah. Oh yeah. He was very, and he would
*  also show up really late. Really? He's into showing up really late. And use two swords. Yeah. Hours late.
*  Hours late. So you'd be freaking out for hours while he's taking a nap. Because the guy would
*  be waiting on the beach and then he would show up hours late and he wouldn't even have a sword.
*  Just use an oar and fuck you up with an oar. What? Yeah. Because oars are longer. So you got this
*  sword and you stand there with a sword and this guy comes out with a long stick and just fucking
*  cracks you over the head with it. It's not a good thing. Well, he was a big man too. He was an
*  interesting guy, man. I mean, to understand what it takes to defeat more than 60 men in one-on-one
*  combat. Well, it's also not combat. This is life and death shit. This is like,
*  you know, sword play. Getting cut with a sword's not, swords are not terribly forgiving. Bullets
*  are more forgiving than is a sword. Yeah, in a lot of ways. Yeah. You get, you're not walking away
*  from a bloody throat. It's also a very personal way to fuck you up. Dude. You can hear, you feel
*  and hear and see him breathing. I mean, everything. Someone's head just falls and their body still
*  standing. God damn. Their body collapses. Or you cut their arm off. Yeah. Imagine living in the
*  day where that shit was going on all the time. Oh my God. France. In France, there were so many
*  duels. People would walk around with swords and there was a time in France where just you'd see
*  people with like, like they'd lose, they'd have no ear, they'd have a constant scars. That was like
*  a sort of a badge of honor for Nazis. Nazis had dueling scars. Did you know that? No. Oh my God.
*  Pull up Nazi dueling scars. Now here's where it gets really weird. A lot of the operation paperclip
*  scientists that the United States brought over from Nazi Germany, when Nazi Germany was defeated
*  in World War II, the United States took on all their scientists and brought them over to work
*  for NASA. Right. Wernher von Braun. Wernher von Braun, the head of NASA was a fucking straight up
*  complete 100% Nazi. In fact, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if he was alive today,
*  they would prosecute him for crimes against humanity. Right. I mean, he was a real Nazi.
*  Him and his cabinet, all those fucking guys they brought over the hall, these massive cheek scars.
*  Really? Yeah. They had scars all over their face. From dueling? From duels. They would wear goggles
*  and they would wear like some kind of protection on their body and their faces would get sliced
*  open. Wow. And they relished it. It was like a cool thing to have, like a big scar on your face.
*  So who showed us that? I don't know, but as I'm doing that, something popped up that I hadn't seen
*  before. It's actually called modern academic fencing or the Menser in German. I love combat.
*  Slightly different though. They're not just like fighting to fight. Yeah. There's no winner or
*  loser in it. Well, that's interesting. But this, what I want to see is just pull up the images of
*  Nazi dueling scars because they're horrific. Like these guys, like post-duel with, look at that one
*  guy with the goggles on with his face slashed open. See that down there? Yeah. Look at that.
*  Look at that. They'd cut their face like that. Dude. Yeah. So you'd have something that covers
*  your nose and your eyes and look at it. He's got a giant slash in his forehead, a giant slash on
*  his face. Using real. Yeah. See that guy with the blue arrow on his face? Like that kind of shit,
*  those scars on the faces. They would all have those click on that, that guy with the, uh,
*  right there. Look at that. They all had those kinds of scars on their face from dueling.
*  It was a big, look at that guy below him, lower, right below him. No, right below him, right below
*  him. The big image, the big, yeah, right there. Look at that guy's face. See they all had those
*  kinds of scars on their face. And it was like, to let everyone know these were bad motherfuckers that
*  would, you know, have duels with swords. That's crazy. Yeah. It was really, really common, man.
*  Mensur. Is that what you're talking about, Jamie? Yeah. Yeah. M-E-N-S-U-R. What's that stand for
*  again? It's academic fencing. So like they're, it's, it was in college. They did all this.
*  I bet. Yeah. Fucking crazy, man. The bragging scar, Mensur scars or the bragging scar. Yeah.
*  But there was some, there's some horrific pictures of these guys, like post-match, where they were
*  trying to piece their face back together again. And you could see like they're literally like,
*  see inside their face, see their teeth and everything. Cause their, their cheeks been split
*  open. Damn. Yeah. And it was really common. And so a lot of the Nazis that they brought over
*  from operation paperclip to run NASA had these fucking scars on their faces. So they'd be sitting
*  there with Werner von Braun and JFK and you'd see this guy with his giant face scar. Yeah.
*  It's crazy. Swords, man. Yeah. And then those, they had those long, I think it was called,
*  what'd they call it? A rapier or something like that? Rapier. Yeah. A rapier. Oh, it calls it
*  parasier. It's a different version of it, but they had those long pointy swords. Yeah. So you get,
*  you know, it takes this, but yeah. And your nose is gone. Yeah. Fuck that. But they all like wanted
*  to get scarred up. Of course. It's like a cauliflower. I guess. It's all, it's all,
*  it's oldest time. It's as old as time. Young men. Yeah. Young men wanting to be, wanting to prove.
*  Look at that. They went into battle, young men go into battle with full of ideas of linear ideas of
*  duty and honor and glory. And then unfortunately war can many times make a mockery of that.
*  War is obviously a fog and insane and chaotic and unfair and not linear and crazy and
*  horrifying and all those things. And lacks dignity and all those things. You know, you see that a
*  lot. It seems to me that when a lot of soldiers I've spoken to had real combat experience,
*  when they come out of that, they, it's very difficult for them. There's a lot to come to
*  terms with. And sometimes they have a lot of trouble bringing their life back into a linear
*  way of thinking. How could it go from one way of life where everything is life and death? Yeah.
*  Every, every corner you turn around, it could be the end every day that you're out there. It
*  could be the end. Well, we, we as that's one thing life and death is again, linear and bilateral,
*  but you know, there are a lot of things that happen. What do you mean by linear? When you
*  say that there are certain concepts when we as human beings, I think most of us have a contract
*  with life. You know, you grow up and you say, if I work hard and I keep swinging, I'm going to,
*  it's going to pay dividends. Right. And most of us live that way. Most of us believe in fair play.
*  Like something about the universe is somewhat fair. The universe rewards hustle, the universe
*  rewards, you know, we have these ideas and we have to believe in those ideas. And usually we're right
*  about it. Right. It's almost like, um, we, we enter a game where we know I can jab and I can punch
*  and I can hook, but sometimes you get fucking kicked in the face and you go, but that wasn't
*  the rule I was playing with, you know, and it's like, well, hold on, I was boxing and you're doing
*  MMA. Right. And life does that to you. War can do that to you to a point where you lose your faith
*  in who wrote, um, where the wild things are. I never forgot. He said, they said, are you a religious?
*  And he said, no, I'm an atheist. The war took care of that for me. You know, he saw too many
*  things. He saw too many children starve and die and all those things. And I think that when things
*  get bad enough in war, when you get that close to reality and that close to that chaos, whatever
*  contract you had gets shattered. In fact, it gets mocked. You are mocked by the insanity of it all.
*  And any, any notion. So when I say linear, what I mean is sort of like, I'll do this. If you do this
*  for me. So it's a give and take cause and effect. Did you ever see the unforgiven? I did. I love
*  that movie. Do you remember when he kills Gene Hackman and Gene Hackman can't believe that he's
*  going to die? It's not supposed to happen to him. That's what, that's what they say. Sociopaths,
*  when they get, uh, when sociopaths get convicted of life, oftentimes what happens is they look up
*  and they go, what? Wait, what? Me? And it all comes down because of what they, what a sociopath
*  like that, a criminal sociopath usually believes is there it's impossible. They'll never get caught
*  because they're too smart. You know, because they're too smart or they think the world revolves
*  around them. And so the idea of both of those punished. Well, well, well, Hitler, you know,
*  according to historian, uh, Kimmer's name, Buckholtz, uh, he said, uh, I think it was John
*  Buckholtz said, said Hitler was so colossally self involved, self centered that he truly believed
*  that when the war was lost and he came to the realization of the war was lost, he expected
*  Germany to self emulate the expected Germany, all Germans to burn themselves, to kill themselves and
*  light themselves on fire. Essentially. He expected that from the German people because he was going
*  to do it. Yes. Yes. And he was going to do that. That, that is according to buckholtz, uh, the
*  historian who follows this stuff. Yeah. And that's not uncommon for the great sociopaths,
*  the great, you know, I mean, if you think about Genghis Khan, he, he had, he truly believed that
*  and almost did that he could dominate and own the entire world. These people like Alexander the
*  great and those kinds of people who, who were clearly, I'm sure they're enemies, didn't think
*  of them as so great, but they, they had this force of nature, this ability to believe in
*  themselves to the point where they, they were going to own the world. And some of them almost
*  did. Well, if you think about it, any kind of thing where you're trying to conquer something,
*  say if you have a small tribe and there's another tribe that's close to the river and they have more
*  resources and you're in dispute with them and you try to conquer that tribe, that is one level of
*  this game. Right. We're going to, we're going to get our warriors together. We're going to sneak
*  in the middle of the night. Maybe. Yeah. But the point is there's that level. So let's say,
*  let's not call it a game, but let's say this is an endeavor. This is a thing that you're doing
*  with anything that anybody does. Some people take it way further, right? Like some people try an
*  open mic night and they go, this is kind of interesting. I'll do standup every now and then
*  they do it once a month. Other people, they get obsessed. They do it every day and they do 10 sets
*  a day and they live in New York city and they take fucking cabs everywhere and Ubers and they do,
*  you know, and they live it. They're like Mark Norman, right? They live it. That's the same thing
*  with war. It's the same thing with everything. Same thing with fighting. Same thing with everything.
*  You know, some people just, they become obsessed. It becomes everything. It becomes their everything
*  and they don't care about anything else. They don't care about other people. They don't care
*  about the environment. Yeah. That's trying to get really good at something, but I think some people
*  try to literally remake the world in their image. I think so too, but I think that obsession
*  carries on. I think the obsession to conquer a neighboring tribe or to take over a town
*  or to conquer a city or a country or a continent, there's just weird things that people do
*  where they take things as far as they can be taken and they do that even with war.
*  That scares the shit out of me with China. It really does because they,
*  oh, here's something I wanted to talk about. This is something I sent you, Jamie, that 20 million
*  cell phone users are missing from China. Where does that stat come from? Is that an American stat?
*  This is what they don't know. They don't know if this means there's 20 million casualties
*  because it also coincides with their switch to 5G. They switched from 5G in January. From January to
*  March, China lost 20 million cell phone users. Now, what does that mean though? It's hard to tell,
*  but I think you could safely say whatever they say the casualty number is, is bullshit.
*  Exactly. That's pretty safe because they've been bullshitting left and right about the whole thing.
*  They go on Twitter. There's some branch of the government that's involved in
*  propaganda that's trying to say this is the United States government creation.
*  Of course. The Chinese are incredibly practical. The Chinese, a lot of people,
*  and I'm speaking of the government, of course, but I think when you live in a society that has been
*  essentially communist or really at the mercy of a central authority and the all-powerful central
*  authority for so long. Forever. Yeah. Forever. It's also that's a society that treated religion
*  with great disdain and suspicion. They didn't really have, even though there are small pockets
*  of these different, but for the most part, I think when you forcibly rid a population of religion,
*  what you are left with is something that takes its place. Sure, an ideology like communism or
*  whatever, but they're not really communist anymore. I do think what happens is you get a
*  population that deals in practicality. That is, I'm sure, very good to each other when they know
*  somebody, but also deals in things like cause and effect. One of the things, a friend of mine,
*  I'm speaking for a friend of mine who does a lot of business, billions of dollars business with China,
*  and another friend, in fact, who does a lot of business with China, did so and speaks fluent
*  Chinese. Both of them had something, an interesting observation, which was that when you speak about
*  morality in a Judeo-Christian way, when you think about, you say, well, that's just the wrong way
*  to do it. That in dealing in business with a Chinese company is not necessarily, that's not
*  really the way to approach business. They are way more practical than that. That doesn't mean that
*  the average Chinese person is not moral or ethical. I don't know, but certainly you will get burned if
*  you are playing by the rules that you are used to, which would be just don't do it because it's
*  not the right thing to do. That's not going to find its way a lot of times when you're dealing
*  in commerce with China. Well, you're dealing with a military dictatorship that thinks about things
*  the same way they think about war. Correct. They are not our ally. I believe they are our enemy.
*  They'll do whatever they can, I think, to get an upper hand. They also now have enough wealth,
*  and they have a huge middle class where they can almost start, they're starting to become way more
*  self-sufficient. We don't have the symbiotic relationship we used to with China. China doesn't
*  need our consumers as much as they did, not even close. They have their own consumers in their own
*  country. What's weird is that we need them. What's weird is how much we need them for the manufacturing
*  of medicine. 97% of all our antibiotics are made in China. That is so crazy. It's stupid. How did we ever let that happen?
*  China and India. How did they ever let that happen? Is it because they can save money?
*  It's more efficient. Is it more efficient or is it more cost-effective? They're better at making it.
*  But why? Do they have magic? No, yes. Why can't we do it? Their factories are amazing. They're incredibly
*  efficient. People worry about the Chinese. I don't think they'll ever be in our area code as
*  innovators. They steal from us. They take our intellectual property, et cetera. But they'll
*  always be a catch-up game. Part of the reason, I think, is that I love the quote from
*  Why Nations Fail. I believe China, yes, they put their Uyghurs in concentration camps.
*  I went to Beijing. The first thing they said is, you cannot speak about the government. If you say
*  anything about the government, you will be sent home. Oh, and by the way, here's a cell phone,
*  Brian. You can use WeChat. You're not using your iPhone. When was this? This was when I did a movie
*  this summer, two summers ago. So they gave you a phone to use. Uh-huh. And they said you can't use
*  your phone. And you don't get on Google. You have to find thousands of firewalls. You have to find
*  all different ways to get over their firewalls because they control the internet there. Make no
*  mistake. So can you use a VPN? I don't know what that is. Virtual private network or ExpressVPN?
*  You try to do that and then they block that too. So you have to keep coming up with new ways. I
*  was right there with the production designer assistant who was dealing with that issue. So
*  you're essentially at the mercy of their news. Of course. So here's the thing. There's a great
*  quote. And I've said it before probably even on this podcast and I love it. You can hold a gun
*  to a man's head and make him move a box or a rock. You cannot hold a gun to a man's head and make
*  him have a great idea. And as long, any country- That's a great quote. It's a great quote. So
*  China, Russia, you guys have great weapons and you have great power and manufacturing.
*  You will never be a country of great ideas because- They oppress people.
*  Because you oppress people and people can't give you motherfuckers the finger.
*  Xi is the most powerful man in China along with his people, his inner circle. And if you in any
*  way look at the whistleblowers. Isn't it interesting that the whistleblowers, the original whistleblowers
*  on the coronavirus are dead and they were doctors in their 30s. Did they die of the disease? Did
*  they or what happened? A lot of them, a lot of the journalists, a lot of the journalists and a lot of
*  those doctors were disappeared. They just didn't, they're dead or they disappeared. China can do
*  that. And somebody who lived there for their whole life, I was there and he was an American and said,
*  people get disappeared here all the time, dude. You don't speak against the government. It just
*  doesn't happen. And I think that's one of the great evils. And that's what I worry about. Anytime we
*  have a pandemic like this where the government can just shut you down at the behest of scientists
*  and doctors, I suppose. But I get very worried when someone like Gavin Newsom can say nobody's
*  going back to work for a month. I'm not saying that right now that isn't a sound policy. I just
*  get very worried when the government has that kind of power to shut all of this down without a discussion.
*  Once they start with that kind of totalitarian power, it's very difficult to turn that off.
*  That's right. It's for our own good. If you study history, it's always for the people's good.
*  Well, that's what Edward Snowden is warning everybody about this now.
*  He should be. Hitler, when he came to power, talked about that. He said,
*  I think there was a fire in the Reichstag and he used these emergency powers to suspend civil
*  liberties. They started the fire so they could do that. It was a false flag. They did that. It's the
*  same way Nero burned Rome. Same reason. It's the age old. That's what the conspiracy theorists
*  think that 9-11 was. Good for them. I appreciate their paranoia. I think that's American.
*  I don't think that's a bad thing and I think you should always be. What's the fundamental
*  question to political philosophy? The fundamental question? Who governs the governor? Very important.
*  Who's governing the governor? I don't trust my government and I shouldn't.
*  No, you shouldn't. It's also like people that have power, like the kind of unchecked power that
*  you see in China, they're not going to give that up. Career politicians. They're going to fight for
*  it. They're going to fight for it. Well, you see that with career politicians. You see that with
*  this bill that they're trying to pass to help people that are dealing with this coronavirus
*  because they can't work and they're slipping all kinds of stuff in there. Of course. AOC and Bernie
*  Sanders, they're all slipping things in there about the environment. Of course. It's like, hey, guys,
*  we want to fucking solve a problem. Slipping into the stimulus package. That is something
*  that politicians do. They utilize this moment to try to use it to leverage their own causes,
*  their own pet causes, the things that they think are also important. There are a group of people
*  that did that with the invasion of Iraq. When 9-11 came along, they said, look, Iraq is harboring
*  al-Qaeda terrorists. They probably are getting weapons into the hands of people like al-Qaeda.
*  There was a whole story that was woven up and that was a way of essentially
*  crippling the fourth largest army in the world, which was Iraq, and making our allies.
*  Did you ever hear the Bill Hicks bit? He goes, they said, Bill, Iraq is the fourth largest army.
*  He goes, yeah, but after the first three, there's a real big drop off.
*  He's like the fifth largest is a salvation army.
*  It's so true. Yeah.
*  We had a whole great bit about the size of armies.
*  Well, we were in Afghanistan for, how long was it, guys? 18 years?
*  He goes, hey, Bill, they say, Bill, it's a war when there's two armies fighting.
*  Bill, Iraq is the fourth largest army in the world.
*  Doesn't mean we won't stay there. He had some great bits, man.
*  Some great points about shit. Yeah.
*  Thought outside the box. That's what I'm always amazed at is how these things can carry on.
*  Somebody did a really cool funny thing about how every general in the Iraq,
*  in the Afghanistan theater, every single year would say, we are at a turning point where the
*  Taliban will be under our control. Every time they would make a case for the Iraq war, more money,
*  I'm sorry, for the Afghan war, more money, more logistics, all those things that required more
*  troops, the generals would say, it was always the same wording. We're at a turning point
*  and we just need a little more. That's what they have to say.
*  Yeah. What's interesting is if they really did accomplish that, they'd actually
*  cut off the honeypot. Of course.
*  They wouldn't have the money coming out. That's right.
*  That's the darkest conspiracy ever, that war is prolonged in order to prop up the military
*  industrial complex. What's really crazy about the military industrial complex is when there was
*  Eisenhower talking about it on TV, which was really terrifying. That was when the first
*  people were introduced to this concept, but Trump was talking about it recently.
*  Trump's doing this thing. He's like, this is a military industrial complex and these guys want
*  to go to war. He's just saying it sort of casually like, hey man, who are you talking about?
*  Who are these fucking people? There's a lot of money in it.
*  Oh my God. Not only that,
*  there are other people, non-governmental organizations too, that get raided by their
*  burn rates. We're going to build a dam here. Well, we don't need a dam here, but we're going to build
*  it anyway because we're a lot of that money. There's a lot of that goes on. That's why with
*  conspiracy theories, I'm way more apt to believe that the government is way more incompetent that
*  it is competent. It's just a massive bloated bureaucracy that doesn't run well. I know guys,
*  I know there's a group of people controlling everything. The fuck out of here.
*  There's a little bit of that. There's definitely a lot of incompetence, but there's also a lot
*  of collusion. There's also a lot of people doing things specifically because they know
*  it's profitable. It's going to make money. Yes. Yes. And also look, what they're doing,
*  they're Bernie Sanders to try to keep them from winning the DNC or rather from winning
*  the Democratic nomination. They've conspired and they put a guy who literally is going senile.
*  That's what's shocking. In front of our eyes. That's what's shocking. And they're trying to
*  pretend it's not happening. How about Amy Klobuchar? She's great. She didn't know who the
*  president of Mexico was. She had no idea what his name was. Yes. But she's doing an interview with
*  a guy from Mexico, a journalist. But she's a smart woman who, I just think she's way more
*  moderate and she seems articulate. Biden's 79. Listen, just because someone seems articulate
*  doesn't mean they should be the president. True. If you don't know who the president of Mexico is,
*  maybe you haven't done enough studying. Yeah. Do you know who the president of Mexico is? I have
*  no idea. I'm not trying to run for president. I barely know the guy from Canada, the Trudeau guy.
*  I just know him because he's been busted with blackface. I'm like, LOL. Well, his father was
*  the longtime premier. Yes. Listen, man, I don't think anybody should be president. Really? Yeah.
*  No, I think it's a terrible idea. I think there's no way you really can be responsible for all those
*  things. There's no way you could really be well read on all the different variables and everything
*  when it comes to economics, when it comes to the environment, when it comes to military operations,
*  when it comes to the fucking energy and industry. There's no fucking way one person, it should be
*  a large group of people that essentially have no stake in the game. It should be people that have
*  no ability to profit whatsoever. They get a healthy income and they cannot profit outside of that.
*  There should be some sort of a regulation. And then after you're gone, it should be impossible
*  for you to make speeches to banks whether you get paid a half a million dollars. Well, there's
*  supposed to be a cooling off period. And Elizabeth Warren wanted a two-year cooling off period. I
*  think right now there's only a six-month or an eight-month. If you work for the Department of
*  Defense, you can't go back to Raytheon or Boeing. You're not supposed to be able to go back for at
*  least two years. Oh, great. So for two years, you go, man, two years, I'm going to be so rich.
*  Exactly. Oh, boy. 24 months goes by quick. Yes, it does. It should be 200 years. I agree. It
*  should be a large. It should be like the Scientology contract where it's billions and billions of
*  years. You can never do it. Do you know that? Yes, I know. It's a billion-year contract. That's
*  a wonderful contract. It's enforceable. Yeah. One billion. It's 70 billion years.
*  Yeah, man, I don't know. It's not there's anything wrong with Amy Klobuchar. Look,
*  I think Tulsi Gabbard was the most interesting. I liked her too. Of all of them to me. And they
*  shut her out quick. As soon as she sank Kamala Harris. Why did they shut her out though?
*  Because of the Kamala Harris thing. They wanted Kamala Harris to win. And she sank her in one
*  debate when she stated all those irrefutable facts. And everyone's like, whoa, she's throwing
*  bombs. She did, didn't she? They fucking cut her out of the mix after that. They cut her out of the
*  mix quick. It's interesting, man, because it's obviously not, let's see who the people choose.
*  It's let's manipulate the opinions of the public. This is what the whole game of running a campaign
*  is. Let's prop someone up. Let's make them look great. Let's have these ads with wonderful music
*  and them standing there looking presidential. And then even in spite of all that, you've got
*  this poor guy in Joe Biden that is experiencing dementia. Is he 77? How old is he? Yes. And Bernie's
*  older than him. Bernie's 80 or he had a heart attack, right? He had a fucking heart attack
*  while he's on campaign. That's a big problem. Took a few days off and is like, we're back.
*  We're back in for the people. Look, Bernie at least believes what he says. He's also,
*  he's also though one of the knocks on him is people like, he's not interested in if you ask
*  him how you're going to pay for all this, you're talking about Bernie looks at the world as right
*  and wrong. And this is a moral issue for him. So and he is, and he did take his honeymoon in the
*  fucking Soviet Union. Say what you will. I do believe the guy is essentially a closet communist.
*  Yeah, I said it. Son of a bitch. I said it. I said it. And I always marvel at socialists. It's not
*  democratic socialists. It's a different, but I still marvel at the idea that if you, if you really
*  trust government, I, again, it comes down to are they as efficient as the marketplace? In some ways,
*  they might be, but in other ways, they may not be. I don't know how they're not doing a great job
*  with the homeless situation in California. Are they? It's the worst job ever. Yes. They really
*  fucked that up. There are a lot of bad, bad jobs. I don't know if you could blame that on
*  democratic socialists that that's blamed on. It's actually a law that you can't remove someone
*  from a place unless you have another place to bring them to. Yes. Yes. And it was a lot of
*  protect poor people and people that were harassed. And then it became a homeless law. And now you go
*  into the underpasses. And this is my thing that I've always said, like, how come it's okay to litter
*  for them? Like they're basically littering. They have junk stacked up. If you throw a fucking coffee
*  cup, rightly so out of window, the cops should be able to pull you over and give you a fucking ticket.
*  And you should have to pay that goddamn ticket. But if you are just
*  tent and you have boxes and shit and cardboard all over the place, you're allowed to do that.
*  And people have to leave you alone. It's not good for them. It's not good for anybody to allow these
*  gigantic homeless encampments to appear under bridges. And I don't know what the solution is,
*  but I just think that alone. Like if you put that on the governor or the president or the mayor,
*  goddamn, that's a problem. That's a problem that's going to take so much money. Opiates,
*  it comes from mental illness. They're already 40 or 50 or whatever they are. What are you going to
*  fix them? Do you know how hard it is to fix a person who's kind of got their shit together?
*  How hard is it to get Bert Christ to stop drinking? How hard is it to get a person who's got their shit
*  together, but has a problem? Like can't stop smoking cigarettes, can't stop gambling. How
*  many fucking people do you know that are like that? All of our friends have one thing that they're
*  just like fucking compelled. Now imagine compounding that to 70,000 people that are
*  at the bottom end of it. So instead of at the top end of it, someone who makes a good living,
*  who has a family and has life insurance and is also a fuck up. Instead of that,
*  you've got someone who's never had anything. And people have been fucking them over their whole
*  life and they've been on drugs since they were young and they were sexually abused and physically
*  abused and they went to juvenile home and then maybe they were in foster care and they were
*  beaten and abused and then here they are at 40. Their brains literally changed. Yes. There's an
*  amazing fucking book by this guy named Joe Newman called Raising Lions. I just read it.
*  Man, I wish I'd read this book when my kids were three. This guy, they bring this guy in.
*  So in the past, I don't know if you know this, but in the past 10 years, bipolar disorder in children
*  has been diagnosed 40 fold. Jesus Christ. Now that doesn't mean, and you know what the solution is
*  typically in the psychiatric ward, medication, medication, then medication. That's the third
*  option. And Joe Newman comes in a lot of times, the fucking great book. And he comes in and
*  essentially will say this kid's throwing tantrums and is impossible to deal with because he is
*  profiting or she is profiting from that behavior. There are kids are way smarter than you think they
*  are. And he instills sort of a very, very interesting approach that I've used and that
*  that it's, it's, I fucking love the book. It's a short, small book. But when you think about,
*  without going into the book and stuff, the reason I bring it up is when you think about,
*  you can change, you can literally change a child's brain by with, with instilling
*  certain behaviors, certain boundaries, certain protocols as a parent, as an adult, as an educator,
*  because what you do is you get them to exercise self-control. You get them to exercise
*  a form of mood stabilization for themselves, but you have to do it in a certain way.
*  When you don't do that with children, when you let them go crazy, freak out and put them in
*  insolation rooms, a lot of times what we'll do is we're there's nothing we're doing wrong. We're
*  not doing anything wrong as adults. We're going to we're reasoning with them. We're talking to them.
*  No, no, no. What we'll do is we'll medicate them because they're out of control. And there is a
*  window with children where you can actually let them keep going down that path and they are
*  basically and then you put them on these mood stabilizers. You put them on psychotics. You put
*  them on anticonvulsive drugs. Sometimes they're on four medications that are in a row. And he's had
*  great success coming in and changing all that because what happened was you just weren't getting
*  the kid to exercise the muscles of self-control. And there's a way to do that. It's very simple,
*  a very interesting book. But what I'm saying is that there is a fucking window with kids
*  where if you don't get to certain kids at a certain time with a good behaviorist,
*  you're in deep fucking shit and their whole life spirals out of control. And then it goes into
*  substance abuse and everything else. So you're talking about now adults who've had all that
*  abuse. I mean, it's I don't know what you would do. I really don't know what the fuck you would
*  do because they're self-medicating to begin with. They're self-medicating to begin with.
*  They've been addicted to drugs most of their lives or all of their behavior has been formed
*  while they're addicted to drugs. This is a giant problem with people that are in their 40s and 50s
*  who've been drug abusers their whole life. Imagining a world with no drugs and no escape
*  from reality and having to be accountable for your actions and then also having to
*  deal with the things that have been done to you and to try to figure out a way to
*  heal from your childhood and your life is over. Your body's starting to fail you, right? You've
*  been abusing yourself for all these years. And the idea that there's some simple solution to dealing
*  with 70,000 people at various stages of that that are currently homeless. Some of them that may be
*  able to recover pretty quickly. They're just on the street for a little bit. They're going to get
*  their shit together and they're going to get out of this. They're determined. There's a lot of people
*  like that. I think people vary widely. Of course they do. They vary so much. But the addiction rate,
*  if you look at the people that really follow this, the addiction rate and the amount of mental
*  illness is very high. Very high. And I think this is where I think like in Singapore, you'd never,
*  in Singapore they'd just start be put in homes. Terrific. I do think that there's something
*  humane about taking people who are rolling their own shit up in a ball. Look, I mean, by the way,
*  schizophrenics, those people need to be taken care of. And they need to be, I don't think it's a
*  terrible thing to show up in a padded wagon and take them into a protective- Be careful with that though.
*  Yeah, I know. I know. Someone might say you're fucking crazy. I know. Scoop you up. I know.
*  That's why it was unconstitutional. Well, yeah, that's why you move the boundaries, right? And
*  this is the argument against what we're saying, right? You move the boundaries in any direction.
*  Where it's not total freedom and then it can slide further from there. That's the problem.
*  How do you define mental illness, right? So that's when you say, well, you're mentally ill,
*  so you can't own a gun. Well, people go, well, how do you define mental illness? You define that as
*  I had an anger management issue at my work once. I suffered from depression sometimes. Well, how about
*  the most polarizing? Religion versus no religion. There's people that think that if you are religious,
*  do you have a mental health issue? And there's people who are religious that think that if you're
*  an atheist, do you have a mental health issue? This is like a very polarizing line in the sand
*  that I've heard argued by intelligent people. I've never heard that. I've seen intelligent people
*  that have blinders on that think that if you're an atheist, you're a fool and you probably have a
*  mental illness and you probably have this extreme belief in science above God and above the laws of
*  Bible and they'll say it in this articulate way. Like, God damn, this guy believes that.
*  He really believes that all atheists have a mental health problem. So if you get a person who's in a
*  position of power that can also run this ideology, they have this ideology. Like one of the things
*  that almost all presidents do, but particularly right wing presidents, ever since Reagan started
*  introducing the religious aspect of the right into like politics, they made it a big deal during
*  the Reagan campaign. You see that so many presidents, particularly on the right, have to
*  talk about God. They have to talk about God. You bring people in. You're on my side. I'm
*  on the God's side. And you see that argument argued by many people who are like fevered
*  Trump supporters. The really, really wacky ones are like super into God wanting Trump to be our
*  president. And then you get this group of people, well, they get into power and you've got some law
*  in place that says that if you're mentally ill, you can be locked up. How many steps does it have
*  to take before it slides to you? It might only take a few. Yeah. And I agree. I do like where I
*  like religious thought in discourse and even in policy, it's limited, but I do like the idea that
*  when you think that you can get human beings out of all problems using human rationality,
*  mathematics, and science, you better be careful with that too, because you can use math and
*  rationality to justify some pretty horrific things as the Soviets and the Nazis did and everybody
*  else. So there is something really, really cool about, and Yuval Harari comes in on this and so
*  does Jonathan Haidt. One of the things Jonathan Haidt says is we're all religious. All human beings
*  are religious. Some people are just religious about science. Some people are religious about
*  rationality at all costs. Some people are religious about nutrition. So you've got to
*  remember, you've got to take an inventory of your own brain and how your belief system works.
*  Politics are as close to religion as you can get. There's also rewards for adhering to one or the
*  other ideology, especially in an aggressive way, because then you get rewarded for being the watch
*  dog of either right-wing values or left-wing values, progressive values, conservative values.
*  We all do, man. People have done it. It's a thing that we do. There's a reward there. You pick it up.
*  Well, I've got to kick out of this COVID thing. Whenever somebody says socialist, I go like this.
*  I go, keep them away. Get them away. No socialist. I have a very visceral reaction to people like
*  AOC or Bernie Sanders because I think that they're socialist, right? But having said that,
*  this COVID disaster, which nobody saw coming, crippled the economy. I know people who are very
*  right-wing, not right-wing, but very market-oriented people who said, we need this fucking
*  $2 trillion stimulus. That's a socialist measure. I was looking for the government for a bill. I
*  don't need it, but I want that $2 trillion in the system that had to be mandated by government
*  politicians. In a COVID-19 scenario, guess what? I'm a bit of a socialist. I find myself going ...
*  That's why I think the idea of there being one or the other, these are two complex,
*  it's too many super complex issues to lump on one side or the other. It's too hard. A person who's
*  an expert on financial intervention or industry intervention to provide medical equipment to deal
*  with a respiratory virus that hits people at an unprecedented rate, that's not a left-wing or
*  right-wing thing. That's a thing. And if that gets lumped into socialism versus libertarianism,
*  we got a fucking real problem because that's a good idea for everybody.
*  Jordan Peterson said something I thought I'd never forgot. He said, when you get that level
*  of detail, when you're trying to solve problems, get food on, get a lot of protein and carbohydrates
*  and fats into, say, 300 million human bodies, or just running a restaurant or whatever it is,
*  when you're trying to get something done, get manufacturing of medicines away from China and
*  the United States, when you get to the level of detail, left-wing and right-wing politics
*  seem to go out the fucking window. You're dealing with practicality now. We got to get a job done.
*  I don't know if you're into fucking geese or if you're a trans. I don't give a shit. Can you do
*  the job well? Let's get this job done and then we can talk about the other stuff. That's kind of
*  what happens. I noticed in a war zone when I was in Afghanistan, I don't say Afghanistan anymore,
*  but I like to be more American. When I was in Afghanistan, I remember none of the soldiers
*  would talk politics. None of them. They were like, I don't talk about that right now. I got a job to
*  do. I got a job to do. I know what my mission is and that's the way it is. When you get to the
*  level of details, a lot of times, it's what I think a lot of times when you deal with people
*  who are really practical, who live in a real world where they have to make a profit with their
*  business or whatever they do when they live in the real world, they tend to be more moderate
*  to maybe more market oriented. When you get people that have been in an academic setting
*  their whole life, in a political setting their whole life where they make laws and you have
*  academics that come up with theories to support those laws, they tend to be a little bit less
*  practical, a little bit more theoretical just by the nature of how they live their lives on a daily
*  basis. It's interesting. I was just thinking this while I was talking about these complex issues.
*  Why are we voting for a person, one individual leader that handles all those things? Why instead
*  isn't there a vote for the person who's got the best solution to each of those individual problems
*  and those are the people that run the country? You know what I'm saying?
*  I do. I love that. It seems like that's a possible idea. You mean so you'd get an
*  economic stud, somebody made a lot of money to run the economy. Yes, you get an economic president.
*  Yes. You get a war president. That's why I like Mitt Romney in a lot of ways. Guy was fucking,
*  you know, an economic stud, did a lot of stuff. Yes, also Mexican. But they hold it against you now.
*  Also Mexican. He is? His dad's Mexican. I didn't know that. His dad tried to run for president
*  because his dad was born in Mexico, he couldn't run for president. I thought he was white as could
*  be. Well, he is because he came from the Mormons who escaped and moved to Mexico so they can boink.
*  They wanted to have all these wives. Let's keep this party rolling. Wow, big Mexican community.
*  Huge. And they, you know, that was the big story with the cartel. They slaughtered nine of them,
*  did they ever find women and children? Why did they ever find those guys? Did they ever find out why?
*  They don't. I don't think they have a definitive answer, obviously, because everyone's dead. But
*  I think they either did it because they were always in dispute with those people from the
*  Mormon colonies or because they mistook them for someone who was in another rival gang. It's hard
*  to tell. You know, the cartel, you know, they're not big on interviews after they know the people.
*  So I don't know what happened. I don't know if the people that shot them were punished by the cartel.
*  That was something that Ed called around and said that would probably happen. They would do it
*  publicly because they don't want to start a war. But like, it's the whole thing's crazy. We got a
*  giant multi billion dollar drug industry that's connected to us. Yeah. How about legalizing it?
*  How's the fucking work going? Not like that. Like, imagine if you had to choose between like,
*  what are your big problems? Is your big problem the massive amounts of drugs that are coming into the
*  country that are killing people and addicting people? Or is it important to hold it down in
*  Afghanistan? Some places on the other side of the planet, you got a place that's connected to that's
*  directly affecting people, like in this really weird way. The best thing I ever heard Bill Maher
*  say, the best thing was when he said, terrorism isn't going to kill you America. It's the corn
*  syrup and all this shitty Fuji. He's right. He's right. He's got some diabetes. I don't know if
*  it's him writing or his monologue writers, but they make some great points. His those monologues
*  that he does for real time. He makes some great points. Yes. Funny shit too. But it's yeah,
*  we have a problem in that whenever you tell someone that they can't do something,
*  which I don't agree with at all, don't get me wrong about this whole drug issue. I don't think you
*  should be able to tell a guy who's 60 years old. He can't do meth. That fucking guy wants to do
*  math. He should be able to do math. Here's the question is, should it be okay for you to sell
*  him math? Well, that's where it gets weird because I know you're a piece of shit if you're selling
*  math. You selling this poor guy math. You know, he doesn't need math. Brian, he needs a hug.
*  This is what would happen. If you had, if you made all drugs legal, they'd get zoned, they'd get taxed.
*  There would be ways to do it. You look, you want to, you want to do meth, but watch this. The
*  conversation would be like this. It'd be exactly like this. You want to do meth. First of all,
*  if you want to work for my company, no meth. I got a private company. No meth. You can't do
*  meth. I know it sounds crazy, but you're not an efficient worker. You want to be a pilot? No
*  meth. You want to be a cop? No meth. You want to work in my factory heavy machinery? No meth.
*  Video games. I mean, maybe it'll help you, but if you want to lose your teeth,
*  God, you fucking idiot God. So I think again, cocaine. Now we're going to have very pure cocaine
*  and guess what? To get it from leaf to powder, less murder, no murder. In fact, how's that sound?
*  It's locally sourced. How's that sound? You can do your blow. And again, you want to do blow.
*  I got to wake up in the morning. I can't be up all night. I would love to do blow. I love blow.
*  I can't do it because probably five, six times in my life. Fantastic. And you love it and you've
*  never done it more than that? It's the best drug of all time. Really? It's the best drug of all
*  time. Again, it's like the joke is when two people are doing blow, they start a business together.
*  You know what I mean? It's like, let's just fucking open a candle store. And it sounds like the best
*  idea in the world, but I don't do below. I don't, I'm not a drug guy. I don't have time, you know,
*  but the point is if you had a place I could go and it was pure and it wasn't cut with a bunch of
*  shit I don't know about, and I knew I could do it and fucking talk to my friend or have sex with
*  some, you know, whatever it is. Maybe if I had time, maybe, but if it was consistency, give me
*  the responsibility. If there was consistency, like if all drugs that were dangerous were illegal,
*  then maybe I could kind of get your point. But how many people die of overdoses every year of
*  prescription drugs? A lot. How many people abuse prescription drugs? A lot. And alcohol.
*  Yeah, exactly. Alcohol, which is one of the most destructive drugs and one of the most readily
*  available. And is an essential that's open while we're keeping social distancing. Alcohol. Yeah.
*  So again, I ask you, tell me the difference. So what we've done is supported a horrific criminal
*  enterprise all over the world, all of Latin America. And we continue to. Yeah. And so many
*  innocent Mexican women and children and men and businesses and lives destroyed and so many
*  Central American lives and it's just destroyed the fabric of those societies. Now imagine
*  you're supposed to take care of this problem and coronavirus and the economy and health care and
*  you're running for reelection and North Korea and Germany. I know what I did. And this. I don't.
*  What? All right. I make all drugs legal. I think that is a logical way of looking at it. Yeah. But
*  I think that the growing pains of that would be people would lose their fucking minds at you
*  if they lost their children during the growing pains and they can attribute their child overdosing
*  on heroin because their son bought it legally and left it in the house and now someone's dead. Sure.
*  You have that. And I think you're going to have a lot less of that because eventually I'd have a lot
*  of this heroin would be regulated. When you went to a store and bought heroin, just like with weed,
*  you'd know exactly what you were getting. You weren't getting a hot shot. You were getting no,
*  no, what's the other fentanyl and all you'd get, you'd get, you know, exactly what you were getting.
*  I'd have it. I'd have a place you could do it if you wanted it to be all kinds of stuff.
*  And then by the way, and you can't sustain that habit. The people that are junkies would be
*  junkies anyway, but at least there'd be a place, it'd be a safe place for them to go and get it,
*  maybe to do it like they do in Zurich. But more importantly, I legalize all fucking drugs because
*  I don't know, because this war on drugs ain't going so well. There'd be a lot less murder.
*  I'll tell you that in my opinion. Well, we would need someone to figure out, first of all,
*  how do you have less people that are, that's another Ed called the wrong time. How do you
*  have less people that are even interested in doing heroin? Like we've obviously done something
*  terribly wrong with people that are interested in heroin. Like why, why are people willing to
*  do drugs like crocodiles? You know, that shit that people were shooting at their body that was making
*  their, that's the real problem in fixing it with a patch, left or right oriented patch. Be careful
*  with the tip of that thing. The knife pokes through it, stabbing the hand. That's a gift
*  from Ed. He's the same guy who brought me the death. I want a knife, dude. Please give me one
*  of these. I want to carry this with me. I figured out how to death whistle. You just blow on it.
*  You're not as good as me.
*  I'd give it to you, but there's social distancing rules. Give me that shit. No. Fuck. Yeah. I was
*  going to say you can't give a fuck. People are watching. We're set a bad example. That's true.
*  Actually. Um, I, I, but that's what I'm saying. I mean, imagine someone who has to take care of
*  each one of those things. Yeah. Each one of those things is ridiculous. Let's a president of the
*  homeless, this one guy, one person, one woman. We have drugs ours. We have, but they don't have the
*  kind of power that I'm going to give them. Really? Yeah. I'm going to give them presidential power.
*  I don't think one person should be able to like let people out of jail and do this and move that.
*  What if we had one person that stays in his fucking lane? Like, what are you really good at?
*  But we have, we have a secretary and energy secretary. We have an education secretary.
*  Here's what I work in this cabinet. What I'm saying is like a king of immigration. This is the king.
*  This is the person, the queen of immigration, the queen of environment. Yeah. Not even the
*  you change the title. Yes. So female wins it. So you think giving apologies, more power
*  is the answer. Queens and queens, ties them into the job. I don't like this idea. Well,
*  call it a president, call it the head of. There's no, but we have Zara. Zara is fucking a king.
*  But no one big guy. Yeah. But I'm talking about, it's there. They, they write the budget. They do
*  everything. Yeah. But doesn't Zara, doesn't Zara come from, so you have the drugs are,
*  you've got the education. Zara comes from Caesar, right? Isn't that Russian for Caesar?
*  The king is that what it is? It's a Russian name. It's a dope name. Anytime you can say,
*  Zara Zara, I'd love to be a Zara. I made a drug Zara. I was like, what I'll be the sex are
*  what's that? I know it means Russian. I think Zara means Caesar. Doesn't it? I think that the
*  root is if you had one person in this country that, that was autonomous, they didn't need the
*  approval of the top president guy. They just had a thing to solve. They don't need his like,
*  no, no, no, that'd be a huge, that'd be a terrible idea. Why? Because you've had people,
*  well, I mean, think about an education queen. I mean, like, look at Betsy DeVos. She's got her
*  ideas on how to run classrooms, but there's massive pushback from teachers and everybody else. So,
*  so these are very controversial. Go ahead. Which one she gets to kill people.
*  Now you're talking one loves Jesus. Cause that's the one I'm voting for. All right.
*  I heard that argument about George W. Someone said, well,
*  George W is with Jesus. So I'm with George W. Wow. Yeah, man. There you go. That's how you get in.
*  When you want to be the education czar, what do you want them teaching a bunch of
*  fucking pagans about Zeus and shit the fuck out of here? That's, that's changing. We need our Jesus.
*  Technology all the way back. Technology as with the enlightenment, as you were able to predict the
*  movement of the planets. That was radical. Cause that wasn't, that wasn't, that went, hey, wait,
*  the Bible doesn't tell us that this guy, Haley, Albert Haley was able to predict Haley's comment
*  or, or Newton or Copernicus or Galileo, who are proving this stuff mathematically. They were
*  revolutionaries. Holy fuck. It was so outrageous, but the church was like, wait a minute, this is
*  destroying the existence of God. When Einstein came along and said, time and space are relative,
*  depending on how fast you're moving. Why think about how important education is, right?
*  It's the most important thing. And just giving someone tools to shape their mind. Now think of
*  it in terms of the prestige that you get as being just a high school teacher. It's nothing.
*  It's nothing. No one cares. You're doing one of the most important services to a young mind
*  that ever you teaching them, literally filling their minds with information. Imagine if someone
*  was in charge of education in this country who can, who could convince everybody who had a real
*  philosophy and a real strategy for educating kids and talked about it in a way like this is how we're
*  going to make, we do have that. No, no, no. One person who's the president of education.
*  One person can't solve these problems. We elect them. I'd be the terrible idea. Cause
*  who's going to be the president of education? Education. Yeah, but this is the crowds. They
*  all get together. They have to have open debate. The president can't have all power.
*  Well, this is my new, my new take on it. We need dictators that are benevolent.
*  My God, you're a monarchist. You fucking monarchist. Imagine if that's the strategy.
*  Imagine if that's what really works. That's what used to happen.
*  One really nice person who runs the whole thing.
*  One nice person. One really nice. I don't believe in nice people. I don't think they exist.
*  I believe human beings are nice people. But human beings are one of the nicest people. I know.
*  But I'd be a terrible, terrible cop. That's why I've had to like kick people out of your life.
*  It's true. Cause I'm like, Hey man, I trust everybody. I love everybody. You love everybody.
*  You let everybody in. I got, I got fucked over recently badly financially. And I was like,
*  dude, you, there's a couple of times in your life where I've had to pull you aside. Hey fucker.
*  Yeah. If I didn't love you, I wouldn't be telling you this. Yeah. It's time to run.
*  It's true. I, I am, I suppose I'm, I'd be a very bad cop because I'd be like, what
*  happened? I need to hit you. Like, what the fuck? All right. I'm going to let you go,
*  but God damn it. If you do that, I'm so mad. I'll let you go. No certain things. I'd have no mercy
*  for though. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. And that's the thing, right? There's like
*  things that people can do where you're like, you know, child murder. That's it. See you later.
*  No coming back. See you later. There's things like that. Even if you, if even if I catch you
*  with a large trove of child pornography, you can't, what am I going to do, dude? If that's
*  really what turns you on, I got it. I don't know what to say. Have you seen one of the weird,
*  you know, cause progressive ideology, right? Like we were talking about before really is in some ways
*  is a religion, just like conservative ideologies. It takes on some of the, some of the characteristics
*  of a religion. The w when there was people predicting this, but almost ingest that one day,
*  people that are so progressive, they would look at people who are pedophiles and saying that this
*  is, this is just who they are. And this is like, this is their sexual programming, like how they
*  are as a person and we shouldn't judge them by who they are. That's fine. I can even, I'll watch this.
*  I'll grant you that watch this. So, so let's say with like Robert Sapolsky's work or people like
*  this who are studying this stuff, we don't know, we don't know. I don't think people choose to be
*  pedophiles. What happens is they wake up and they go, I have, I have this irrational attraction to
*  children. Okay. So you're attracted to, let's say toddlers or something horrible. Now I grant you
*  that your brain works this way. I still can't have you, if you have these impulses, I can't have you
*  out in society, bro. Now, if you want to volunteer for castration or if there's a, if there's a way
*  to get you to not have these urges, now we can talk. But if you, if they, if I don't know how to
*  mitigate or erase that kind of deep seated programming, you've got to go away. I got to
*  know where you are at all times. I can't have you near children that this is why we incarcerate
*  these people. Right. And so it's, I think we're going to be facing that exact question. We're
*  going to be saying it the more we learn about the brain and stuff, we're going to be realizing
*  you are programmed a certain way. Okay. We all are now to what degree, if you listen to Sam Harris,
*  Sam doesn't even believe in free will, you know, Sam will tell you, wow, we have no control over the,
*  the mechanics of how we make a decision. When did it start? I mean, what happened? Sapolsky's book
*  behaves about this. I don't know. I still can't run a society that gives free reign to people
*  that cause destructive harm. You know, the story about there was a guy who had a tumor in his brain
*  and the tumor was literally turning him into a pedophile. Yes. He has the tumor removed. They
*  prove it. They prove the tumor is there as the tumor removed, all these thoughts go away. They
*  come back a few years later, they do another MRI and they find out the tumor's returned.
*  Like, what do you do with that? Cause there's a guy like you almost,
*  you're, he's, he got sick. He literally got sick and that sickness led to him being a criminal.
*  There's also a, you can have a lesion on your brain, the size of a, the head of a pin.
*  If it's in the right part of your brain, it will turn you into a homicidal maniac.
*  We know these things. So really? Yes. The head of a pin. Yes. In fact, it's in a series of lectures by
*  in the great ideas of psychology. And it's really fascinating that you can, by Daniel Robinson or
*  David Robinson, an amazing guy, but yeah, and there is that case and there have been,
*  there have been cases of this. We know that there are parts of the brain when damaged
*  can cause you to be fucking, you know, a maniac. Imagine if they did that. What if they did that
*  to people? Like if you, you really wanted to be the ultimate soldier and they had like a part of
*  your brain that turns you into a berserker and they would just hit that switch. Yeah.
*  Well, they say that a lot of what they do, psyche valves on high level operators and
*  some of those people are able to shut off certain parts of their, you know, they can be great
*  fathers and husbands and brothers and they can also shut off. And when it's time to shut that
*  off, everybody dies and they can, it's called, you can deviate. It's called a, there's a term for it,
*  sociopath. You can deviate into a sociopath. You can deviate into that space. You can make the
*  decisions that have to be made and then come back to morality. Yeah. I think a lot of us could do
*  that. If you have an ideology, if you're protecting your homeland or whatever it might be, that's a
*  formidable soldier is trying to protect what he loves. Well, and who faces the reality of the
*  necessity of that, like runs into really bad people in parts of the world that really are torturing
*  and murdering people, making videos and putting them up on YouTube. Like you run into those kind
*  of people and you actually see them in the world. You see the damage that they're doing to people
*  in the real world. I know a lot of soldiers have felt that way who saw that shit and they were
*  like, listen, man, that's why I killed them. And I slept well last night. You know, there's something
*  about what's going on now for all of us where there's this massive wake up call as to the frailty of
*  our society, the, the, the, how poorly we've thought out all the consequences of any sort of
*  global pandemic or any natural disaster, how ill prepared we are. And this is a, this is a,
*  a good opportunity to wake up and look at what we're doing and look how soft we are. Like it's
*  fine to be nice. It's fine to be nice. Well, have you noticed that now we're in this pandemic and
*  you don't hear, there's not a lot of talk about progressive ideas and equality. Well, the real
*  progressive ideas you're seeing from people like nurses and doctors and healthcare workers that are,
*  they're putting their fucking their physical health on the line, taking care of these people.
*  And some of them are dying. You're seeing people that are chipping in and food shelters and, and,
*  and, you know, when food kitchens and trying to feed people that are poor, you're seeing people,
*  there's a lot of people putting together GoFundMe's, the comedy stores putting together a fund right
*  now to pay for the wait staff. There's all these different things that are happening that are people
*  putting together that are happening organically. This is what we want. What we don't want is
*  mandated charity, mandated socialism, mandated. And that's what people have a problem with.
*  Because what they're worried about is in great times, in times that things are amazing,
*  we're worried about people who don't want to do their share. We're worried about people where
*  you've created a simple, easy path for them and they've taken it every time and time again,
*  they're lazy and they don't want to do any work. They don't. There's some, there's people that are
*  like that. That's different than what we're experiencing now. What we're experiencing now
*  is the best case scenario for human nature in terms of the outpouring of generosity that you
*  get from a lot of these people that are trying to help other folks that are in need. Yeah,
*  you're going to have some negative stories. You're going to have that too. But what this really is,
*  is a wake up call is that we've had it really, really, really easy. And because of that,
*  we were finding things to be outraged at and the people that experienced real strife in their life
*  and real difficulty, they get angry at that stuff and they get angry at that stuff for a reason
*  because self-indulgence is dangerous because it's catchy and because you tell all your friends
*  that y'all have a good point. The government should just fucking pay us. We should just get paid.
*  Why do these billionaires have money? There should be no billionaires. How about good
*  grammar being racist? Because if you correct somebody's grammar, maybe that person didn't
*  have the education, therefore you're being racist because maybe that person of color doesn't
*  use the kind of grammar that's standard English. This is a new idea too. Yeah, there's a lot of
*  these new ideas that people look for things to be outraged about. Well, it's hard to get food.
*  And again, right now the power's still on. Okay, right now everything is at least three quarters
*  of what it was minus the unemployment, right? You're stuck at home but you're with the people
*  that you love. You can talk to them on your phone. You can watch Netflix. You can do a lot of shit
*  still. You can't go to restaurants. You can't go to movies. You can't go to work but you're kind of
*  still around and then you've got your financial issues. But what if it went one step further?
*  Do we not understand how fucking fragile this is? What if it went one step further? One rock from
*  the sky slams into Chicago. One big ass fucking mile wide rock slams into Chicago. Or a volcano.
*  Or a volcano in Montana that won't stop bubbling. How about that Yellowstone thing that's a giant
*  caldera that's 300 kilometers wide or something stupid like that? Super volcano. I think it's
*  actually 600 kilometers. That super blast would fuck us up forever. It's huge. How big is the
*  caldera of Yellowstone? Well, by the way, maybe climate change is a very real thing and most of
*  us are walking around going, nah, not for us. God will protect us. Well, the problem with that is
*  people weaponize the idea of arguing about climate change. And if you even have a question about it
*  or if you even... It's one of those things, and this is not that the experts aren't correct. I
*  am with the experts. I'm with the science on it. I'm 100% in belief that human beings are accelerating
*  climate change. That's not my point. My point is if someone even brings up, how do you know if
*  you're arguing about it voraciously, right? You're really into fucking... Some people that
*  love arguing about climate change and they love putting you in your fucking place. The oceans are
*  going to be on fire and they get crazy with it. And if you even have a conversation like, where are
*  you getting your information from? They don't really have a good source. It's not like they've
*  spent time studying these papers and looking at the trends and reading books on core samples
*  and talking to you about these shifts. And here's the problem with this shift. This shift is different
*  than the other ones because it's clearly CO2. I tried saying with a group of people, all I try
*  to say is I go, I don't like Trump either, but I will say, and I was going to say, I appreciate it
*  is trying to policy and certain things. I literally was met with this. I went, but I will, but...
*  And they go, oh, no, no, don't fucking, don't give me a butt on this. I'm like, Jesus Christ. Are you
*  that afraid of my ideas? Well, there's a Trump thing. Like you either hate Trump or you love
*  Trump. You know, you can't say like, I get criticized as being some sort of a closet Trump
*  supporter because I say anything he's funny. He's funny. He cracks me up. We're professional
*  comedians. He's hilarious. He's funny. Look, how about stuff that's not even a, no one even gets
*  hurt. The one when he took Greenland and he put a giant Trump tower on it and he tweeted, I promise
*  not to do this. If we buy Greenland, he's hilarious. That's funny. That doesn't mean you're a Nazi.
*  Okay. And I think this is going to calm some of that shit down. This is going to give us real
*  things to be outraged about. And this is a, is this a wake up call that, you know, our medical
*  systems that we have in place to deal with pandemics, they're, they're underfunded, they're
*  underfunded. They have to be, or they're under, underutilized or there's something wrong. There's
*  something wrong. I don't want to say what the cause is. I really don't know. I'm an idiot.
*  Something has left us unprepared. Okay. Let's not blame anybody. It is what it is. No one saw this
*  coming. But now that we know that this can happen. Yeah, this has never happened before all the years
*  since 1776. We've never locked down the country like this, but we did and the whole world did.
*  So let's move forward with a fucking heavy emphasis on putting the brakes to that kind of shit.
*  Figure out what we have to do. Is it because you only have a hundred scientists on it instead of
*  a thousand? Cause let's hire 900 more. Like what are we doing? You're spending so much money on
*  other things. Have a science king. Yes. A science king. Let's have a fucking science king. What's the
*  difference between king and azar? We have a tiger king. Let's have a science king. Yeah. President,
*  science president, science president. Yes. Everybody's a president of something. Economic president.
*  And that way when something goes wrong, you'll go fucking, if Trump just opened the borders.
*  No, you're like, don't know. It's the border king's problem. Yeah. The border king says we
*  got to keep the borders closed. It's not Trump. Trump doesn't get to stay. It's the border king.
*  We have a border king. We have a fucking drug king. We have a sky king. We have a sky king.
*  Really? Oh, he runs the skies. Boy, make sure it's clean. Yep. Guys up there with a fucking little
*  strip. I like testing it every day. Scooping. So like, Hey, sky king, how come the sky's still
*  dirty? You fucking idiot. I like that. Blame the sky king. All right. You can't blame Trump and his
*  cronies. You blame sky king. I like it. I want an elk. You do. You need to get one of those. You
*  don't invite me. It's very, listen, you don't do it anymore. You don't really do it. Dude,
*  I'm dead. I I'm game. I sweetie. I love you. Yeah. There's the level between doing what we did where
*  you have a rifle and doing what you're doing. I was doing both. It's so much work to get to the
*  point where you can do it efficiently. Oh, cause you're doing Bo hunt. Yes. How would I show up
*  with a gun? Well, you could definitely do that. If the place is, if it's legal to have a gun,
*  you know, the place for that for you would be Hawaii. Really? Yes. Lanai access deer. You and
*  I need to go to my friend's property in New Zealand and shoot those red stacks. I'm sure.
*  But they, well, they probably need to shoot those too. New Zealand doesn't have any, they don't have
*  any, he's got five private beaches. You need to bring some wolves, bring some wolves to New
*  Zealand. Dude, what could go wrong? Great idea. We need to go to his place. He's he's jet skis
*  with fucking orcas. He sends me video. He's on his jet ski and his private beach. He goes,
*  ah, orcas under him. The first family that gets eaten inside their tent by wolves.
*  And that can happen and has happened in history. Folks, the first family that that ever happens to
*  we're all going to have a big wake up call as to what a wolf is. It's not that I don't love
*  wolves. I do love wolves. And I went to that wolf connection, that rescue out in the, in the
*  scent at the Palmdale. I went to it really recently with a forest Galante. And did you see,
*  was it? Yeah, hung out with them. They're, they're cool as fuck, but it's pure wolves or hybrids.
*  Most of them are hybrids. Um, one of them was about as close to a pure wolf as you can get.
*  And you couldn't do a goddamn thing with them. This guy said that one time he had managed them
*  for a food fight and he was incorrect. And the, the wolf hasn't spoken to him since three years
*  ago. The wolves like, fuck you. It used to be able to pet them, put them on leash, take them out.
*  Now the wolf won't let them anywhere near him. Really? He decided the guy was a cunt three years
*  ago. That male, male wolves will challenge you and, and you know, certain animals like camels,
*  camels, if they like you, you're good. If they don't like you, they'll piss on you, they'll
*  spit on you and they will grab you and bite you and throw you. They pick you up by your
*  neck with their teeth. I've seen that. Don't fuck around with a camera. I saw a guy trying to kill
*  a camel. He was trying to, uh, yeah, there's like a certain way they killed camels for some religious
*  you can eat, but a certain way they kill them, you know, with a knife, they slice, slice their
*  throat. And he was doing that and this camel was not having it and he grabs them by the back of
*  the neck and just fucking whips them through the air. You realize how strong a camel is. It bites
*  your neck. You're a 150 pound man. You're going flying. You're going flying, dude. He'll chuck
*  you. Chuck you like you throw a house cat. Bourdain ate camel. He said it was really good.
*  So did I. Did you eat it? Yeah. What was it like? Delicious. What does it taste like? It's like,
*  uh, goat, you know, I guess. I mean, a lot of times in Saudi Arabia, you would eat a camel
*  with a huge feast. You'd put a goat inside the camel. Wow. Oh, here's one. This guy's trying to
*  slice. Yeah, this is another one. Okay. Yeah. Right there. Look at that guy. Boom, son.
*  That thing picked him up by his head. He got his whole head in there. Look at that. That's
*  his whole head. Oh my God. That wasn't even just the neck. That thing grabbed his whole head.
*  He's got to be fucked up, bro. He might be paralyzed. Yeah. Now he's moving. Thank God.
*  Look at that. God damn it. Just grabbed his whole head. It picked him up by his head. Yeah, dude,
*  that could easily break your neck, especially if it didn't let go. What if it shook him?
*  Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Are you just held onto the head, shook him a bunch of times?
*  That thing is mean. Fuck, dude. Yeah. Don't fuck with camels. Yeah. So it's like a goat.
*  It's a lot of meat. It's a lot of meat. How many people ate that? I don't remember. I was a kid,
*  by the way. I was 14, 13 when I ate it. So I'm saying goat. They eat with their hands, right?
*  Eat with your right hand. Yes. You do everything with your right hand. And you wash your ass with
*  your left hand. You never give anybody your left hand. So when you're caught stealing traditionally
*  and saw that they would cut off your right hand. Oh my God. So you had to be the last one. You had
*  to be the last one to wait. You'd have to in the goat crab, you'd be the last one to eat. Oh my God.
*  You'd have what was left over. Oh my God. Yeah. What do you do then? Just kill the guy?
*  Why do you want to live like this? No, you live with one hand. It's fine. Figure it out.
*  You know, I don't think we got to the bottom of anything, Brian Callan, but it feels good to
*  complain. I agree, buddy. I love being here. What else? I think that's good.
*  I think we're three hours in. We're three hours in. God, that goes quickly. Fuck,
*  I can't believe that. Yeah, we are. Jesus. I'm joking around, obviously, about the kings,
*  have a king of everything. Joking around about it, obviously. But it is kind of ridiculous that we
*  ever think that one person could be the president and run this whole country. It's so stupid. It's
*  so stupid and it's so tired. When something happens where it's really clear that this wasn't
*  thought out correctly like this and that we didn't know what was coming like this, that we didn't
*  ever think, because it's never happened before. If something's never happened before, we always
*  think it's not going to happen, whether it's a super volcano or an asteroid impact or this.
*  That's the thing. That's what it's got to mean. Even though we know that they've happened,
*  hasn't happened during my life. I'm not prepped. I'm not prepped enough,
*  and I need to get prepped for real. We all should be. We keep talking about going somewhere,
*  and I'm not bullshitting about that. How about a place we can drive to in a short time, though?
*  You could drive to Utah in 10 hours. Really? Yeah. That's not a bad one. Or Vegas. Just camp
*  out in Vegas. I like the idea of somewhere up in the hills in California. Where? Where are you
*  going to go? There's a lot of property. Enough where I can get a well and lots of guns. Maybe
*  you can go to Big Bear. Interesting. Maybe go to Big Bear. Then they would shut those roads off.
*  That's what I worry about. That's right. Then you're fucked. You got to be up there, stuck.
*  Still stuck with Silver Line. They shut those roads off sometimes, unless when it snows out,
*  you have to have chains. You have to have chains if you're driving up there. Yeah, that's a problem.
*  Whenever you see those roads to Big Bear that say you must put chains on your tires. Bill Burr
*  can drive a helicopter. He can fly a helicopter. That's right. So Bill will be our go-to guy.
*  He can. We need a boat to get out and see. But we're assuming we'll have good visibility.
*  The problem with the helicopter thing is if it's fires, if there's fires, you ain't seeing shit.
*  If it's fires, we'll figure it out. If it's a pandemic again. Oh, we'll see you. We need the
*  fucking fire president. That's what we need. We'll get the fire president. You can't say we'll
*  figure it out. We need a rock-solid game plan. We call a fire president who hates fire. We have to
*  have a guy who hates fire. He hates it. Fucking hates fire. Imagine if he's secretly starting
*  fires. Do you know that's a thing? I know a lawyer who defends a kid who starts fires,
*  dresses up like a fireman, and diverts traffic. And they catch him all the time. And he has to
*  go and be like, the kid's obviously crazy. So yeah, he's a sociopath. He gets off on creating
*  these issues. But he loves being a fireman. So he'll start fires. He's done this 11 times
*  since he was a little kid. And now he's an adult. And I think he's in jail now. But he'll dress up.
*  Yeah, he dresses up like a fireman. And he likes to divert traffic and tell people where to go
*  and give them advice. Now imagine you have to fix that guy. Imagine he's homeless. You got to fix
*  him. You got a homeless guy who lights houses on fire and pretends he's a fireman. He's so far gone.
*  What do you do with them? Do you keep them in there forever? Let them out one day. They're
*  going to be more fucked up than they were before they put them in. You make the jail for crazy
*  people much more pleasant. You keep them in the pleasant jail? Yeah. Forever. I don't know.
*  Until I find a way to get him, until he can exhibit that he is fit to go back to society.
*  Did you ever see One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest? Yes. How come they don't have places like that
*  anymore? One of the greatest movies of all time. Do they have places like that anymore? You come in,
*  you come out. How many of them do they have? Do they have enough? I don't know. It seems like
*  they should have more. We have mental, we have hospitals for the criminally insane, hospitals for
*  you know. Right, but do we have enough? Because I think it's almost like the same amount of hospitals
*  that we have regular. Peter Early wrote a book called Crazy. His son suffers from mental illness.
*  And what we do with most of our mental ill is we put them in jail. And I've been to those
*  aquariums that they keep people in his bed. That's where it's fucked up too. It's like,
*  you're also, because you're crazy, you're also committing crimes. And you maybe could have been
*  treated for whatever the mental illness was, particularly if it's a chemical imbalance,
*  right? Yeah. And then you would have never done those crimes. And then you have never been in jail.
*  But I mean, who's responsible for it? Ultimately, we want adults to be responsible for themselves.
*  Yeah. Well, this guy said, Joe Newman, again, who wrote Raising Lions, I recommend it highly.
*  He said, I'm training parents a lot of times. He used to think I was training the kids. A lot of
*  times I'm training the parents and the educators on how to react to the kid. Kid is smart. And the
*  kid is even the kid is playing spacey and stuff or whatever, not paying attention, cutting out of
*  school. He's enjoying the frustration and the social status he gets. He creates frustration in
*  the adult and get social status from doing this. I can make it very boring for him. I'll make it
*  very boring for him. Without interest, just go, hey, time to take a break. You got to stand over
*  there. I know it sucks. But if you can throw a tantrum, but the time starts for when you're
*  done with the tantrum, little things like that. Huge results. Just take the profit out of that.
*  You're saying this genius tells you to put them in timeout? Timeout, but it's a very specific way
*  of doing it. It's hilarious. What's the solution? Kids got to go to timeout. Yeah. Everybody. Well,
*  you get these kids who freak out. They have to be put in isolation. You argue with them. No, no, no.
*  That's part of the president's problem. Yeah. So you can't put them in timeout. That's probably
*  true. If there was like Nancy Pelosi had like a few timeouts per year, she could just use it on
*  Trump and Trump would just have to stand in the corner and not talk. Take your phone away.
*  I'm going to take your phone away. No tweeting. No, no, no, no, no. No. I fucking legit timeout.
*  Nancy Pelosi. You stand in the corner. She's the kind of person that would put all of us in timeout.
*  She's a mom. But if she could do that. Yeah. Imagine how interesting that would be. She'd go
*  like this. Donald, Donald, why don't we take a break? Go over there. Yeah. You're going to go
*  over to the boring chair. If there was like things that a person could do where you had to put them
*  in timeout, you and I would be in timeout a lot. How often would you be in timeout per year?
*  Well, as a kid? Right now as an adult, if they had timeout still. I need a lot of timeouts.
*  No, but there's a thing like at a certain point in time, you become the master of your own destiny.
*  Nobody can put you in a timeout anymore unless you're at work and you get brought in.
*  I need timeouts because I'll find ways to procrastinate and get not to the things I'm
*  supposed to do. Can you imagine if you had a boss at the podcast and they sat you and Brendan down
*  and we're talking about your job performance? I'd have a problem with it. They do that with radio
*  shows. That's what radio shows are. They're like basically a podcast, but with a boss. I know.
*  I know. You know, Kevin and Bean, you know, those guys. I love, you know, Kevin, they just
*  fired him. I didn't know they fired Kevin. I thought Kevin kind of voluntarily. No, no, no,
*  no. They fired him and then they fired everybody and then just told them they're done, go home.
*  And they had security guards lead them out of the building. Yeah. Even Kevin? Yes, Kevin. I didn't
*  know Kevin got fired. Yeah, Kevin got fired. That's very recent. Well, Bean left like a year ago. I
*  know. And then Kevin stayed on and K-Rock, like Jimmy Kimmel made a tweet about it. Like how dare
*  you? I just did Kevin and Bean. I love Kevin. Well, it's been Kevin's morning show for like
*  since I think January. Kevin and is it, who's the woman? Marla? I don't know. There's a couple
*  people to do it with them. Sorry, I forgot her name. I'm such an asshole. And Dave. But they're both
*  great. It's they just fired everybody. What? Yeah. That's crazy. So there's no more. No, no,
*  I think it probably happened. I mean, I don't know if it had anything to do with the Corona,
*  but it was like when it was kicking in, like when everyone was starting to worry about COVID-19.
*  Damn. Yeah. I'm very, very worried about just what's going to happen. All these small businesses.
*  I don't know how much longer we can sustain this. It's terrible. That's terrible. We need a plan. I
*  got to come. Is there any good news on this? How about this hydrochloroquine with that?
*  Is it thromycin? Does that actually help with sorry, guys, I'm a doctor. Does that help? I read
*  about that. And I read that there's some promise to that. And I read that there's that in a
*  combination of some other medication. So it's essentially this drug that they use to treat
*  malaria. It's an old school drug treatment. And then there's something else with it.
*  Yeah. So it's hydroxychloroquine. It used to be quinine. Now it's a different, it's that people,
*  that didn't work for malaria anymore. And so there's that. And you combine that with
*  a thromycin like a Z pack, I guess. And so those two things apparently mitigate the effects of the
*  virus from what I heard. But then I heard no. So I don't know. Yeah. I mean, who the fuck knows?
*  There's also intravenous vitamin C apparently has an effect, a positive effect on people that are
*  suffering from the illness. But again, this is all anecdotal. They don't have like a real
*  strict protocol of how you handle this disease. It's very easy to catch. It's a new disease.
*  I haven't been as good as I should be. I eat food that's prepared by people.
*  Yeah, you never know. So you never know. Yeah, they didn't know before the Carnival Cruise
*  Line thing that it could stay on surfaces as long as 17 days. Well, I heard nine hours. It depends
*  on no, no, no, no. This is the latest. The people that are examining the cruise ship or the people
*  are stuck on it. Even people that are asymptomatic, they still found traces of this shit 17 days later
*  in their cabins. Well, guess what? I'm done. How crazy is that asymptomatic people? And you can
*  find the stuff in their cabin 17 days later, it's still alive waiting for a host. I don't think
*  Chris Lee has left his house. Is he germaphobe? I just he's just not left his house. He also has
*  a new baby. Yeah. You know, but but you know, you get something delivered from Amazon, you don't
*  know what happened. Yeah, lives on surfaces. Yeah, disinfect it disinfect the world. Let's wrap it up.
*  Brian Callan. Thank you, buddy. Is Will Paso trying to pussy out of the 10 minute podcast or he is
*  we're going to do the 10 for all you 10 minute podcast lovers, me, Chris Lee and Will Sasso.
*  I heard Sasso is we're rebooting getting very sassy with you. He gets sassy with me. He just
*  sends me pictures of bears eating, eating like fish and deer. He just sends me pictures. Yeah,
*  that's what it is. That guy has the biggest calves I've ever seen in my life. He's the funniest
*  fucking human being. Have you ever had him on the podcast? No. Oh, fuck. He's a genius. Oh,
*  he's hilarious. Oh, my God. He's fun to hang out with too. We all hung out together. He's the best.
*  Will Sasso to me, funniest human being maybe of all time. And and coming out in a movie called
*  boss level. Each one of his calves are two of Arnold Schwarzenegger shoulders. Oh, dude,
*  he's so big and strong. But his calves. Oh, yeah, they're that big. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're
*  bull hearts. They're bull hearts. I call them bull hearts. So to two bull hearts in his fucking
*  lower legs. I remember you telling me that and then me seeing them like what is going on? Well,
*  there's a picture on the internet of my head next to his calf and my head is my calf and head
*  worth same size. My head is the same size as a castle. I'm not kidding. It's the weirdest
*  shit ever. Congratulations on your operator status. Thanks, buddy. You saw the way I squeeze
*  up those rounds. I did. Because we want to laugh right now. Complicated Apes on Amazon. Look at
*  this calves. That is so crazy. Look at the size of his fucking calf. Dude, that is so ridiculous.
*  Fucking he was a power lifter. I think he had some record. Dude, those things are ridiculous.
*  Look at that one up there. Who's that? Oh, that another guy? That's him. That's that's that's
*  yes. Those are bull hearts. Those are so big. Look where they're considered on the bone.
*  Wow. That's real. Yes. God damn. Those look like that looks like Arnold in his prime, right?
*  Those look like when he would pose. You ever seen him? Where is that? Bring him. Let me see his
*  his Instagram for a sec. You got a lot of pictures with your face next to his calf.
*  That's very odd. He's so funny. Wearing different shirts. Bring us. Yeah. That's a photo. Bring
*  us Instagram up. I want to see something. Oh, she's she cracks me up. Do do do.
*  Why is he dressing like a woman? Go down. Why is he have a video with Arnold Schwarzenegger?
*  Is he mocking him? I don't know. He just oh, Brian, this is an audio podcast as well. Oh, sorry.
*  We're just going to go down, scroll. Never mind. Forget it. It's just he's just got so many funny
*  what is it? Just will Sasso? What is his will? Sasso? He's the fucking best. I'm fucking see.
*  He's on a boat of windows. He's just standing on a boat and he's just
*  he's just goes, I'm fucking seaworthy as fuck.
*  He's a silly boy. So are you. I love you, buddy. It was fun hanging out with you all day today.
*  Great. Great time. We had to do this more often. I can't wait. That's one thing that I'm getting
*  out of this more than I'm like, I'm really appreciating friends. Yes. That's when the shit
*  gets weird. That's what you really need. You really need friends. You're damn right. I love
*  you people. Bye, everybody. See you. Great. It's great.
