*  I've been saying y'all. Yeah? Yeah. I'm from Florida. Oh right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=25.0s)]
*  Florida's weird. It's kind of southern but it's not really. Yeah. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=30.0s)]
*  Like S-A-W. Saul. What? I saw him. Yeah I saw him over there. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=34.0s)]
*  No. I saw him. What are you saying? Saul him? I saw him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=39.0s)]
*  Are you saying Saul him? I saw him. But you're saying it all together. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=43.0s)]
*  Like Saul him. Yeah like I saw him over there. What a Saul him moment. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=47.0s)]
*  I don't know. Like I saw him. Post 9-11. Like oh shit he went over there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=51.0s)]
*  I just Saul him. Oh. Okay. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=55.0s)]
*  Texas they like to say especially. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=59.0s)]
*  Especially? Especially. Don't love that. Yeah. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=63.0s)]
*  A lot of people they will especially. They say that. Especially. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=67.0s)]
*  Hey hey hey. That's not the word. Don't say it like that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=71.0s)]
*  I like the video that's going viral right now with the redneck dude and he goes [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=75.0s)]
*  I don't care what you call me. Don't call me that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=79.0s)]
*  What does he say? He said you can call me anything you want. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=83.0s)]
*  But don't call me that. Don't call him what? I don't know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=87.0s)]
*  I'm guessing the N word. And I'm guessing gay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=91.0s)]
*  I'm guessing gay. But isn't there like that was the thing about that show Ozark. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=95.0s)]
*  There's a distinction between a redneck and a hillbilly. There he is. Oh. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=99.0s)]
*  When you're a big guy and someone calls you Hoss, Bubba or Big Boy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=103.0s)]
*  You call me anything you want. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=107.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=111.0s)]
*  That's a real guy. That's a real guy. But remember in the movie [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=115.0s)]
*  did you guys watch Ozark? That Netflix show? I watched a little bit of it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=119.0s)]
*  Is that with Jason Bateman? Yeah. Yeah I did watch a lot of it. Fucking great [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=123.0s)]
*  series. It's fucking great. But there's this [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=127.0s)]
*  really wild lady who's a drug smuggler. That older lady. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=131.0s)]
*  And she kills this dude because he calls her either a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=135.0s)]
*  redneck or a hillbilly. I forget which one it was. They had this [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=139.0s)]
*  giant drug deal with the cartel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=143.0s)]
*  And they're about to set this drug deal and the dude [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=147.0s)]
*  said something about them being hillbillies. And so she blows his fucking brains out [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=151.0s)]
*  with a shotgun. It's like what the fuck. That's crazy. That she was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=155.0s)]
*  so mad at that word. That's a white slur. It's either we're rednecks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=159.0s)]
*  and we're not hillbillies or we're hillbillies not rednecks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=163.0s)]
*  I mean they both seem like the same to me. Hillbillies more insulting. I'll tell you that. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=167.0s)]
*  Is it? Yeah it's a way to call a redneck like uneducated and incest [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=171.0s)]
*  pretty much. It's like there's rednecks but then if you say [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=175.0s)]
*  hillbilly it's like a little more. That's what I think. In Florida [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=179.0s)]
*  you would say hillbilly and more insulting. Like you fucking hillbilly. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=183.0s)]
*  Interesting because a lot of guys will call themselves hillbillies and be proud [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=187.0s)]
*  of it though. Yeah but it's more like a self-deprecating [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=191.0s)]
*  thing like a joke at that point. I don't know. I'm a valley girl. I don't know much about [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=195.0s)]
*  hillbilly redneck. I know a little thing or two. I'm talking out of my ass too. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=199.0s)]
*  I'm talking out of my ass. I don't understand. I didn't even know until that show [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=203.0s)]
*  that there was an issue with one of those words. I don't even know which one that really upsets them. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=207.0s)]
*  But that she was willing to shoot this guy and fuck up this whole drug deal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=211.0s)]
*  I don't think it's that serious but. It is with her. With her it is. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=215.0s)]
*  Yeah but she has other issues. I believe that lady's real. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=219.0s)]
*  That lady, whoever that actress is, who's that woman who played that role? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=223.0s)]
*  I was just looking it up. I had her name by. Sorry. It's uh. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=227.0s)]
*  I love that curly head. Oh yeah crazy bitch. That lady is a beast. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=231.0s)]
*  Oh yeah I remember now. She's a beast. She's so good [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=235.0s)]
*  in that role. Oh my god you believe every second of every [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=239.0s)]
*  word that comes out of her mouth. You're like that is that lady. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=243.0s)]
*  That's a real crazy murder and drug dealer lady. She shot a guy in the dick. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=247.0s)]
*  I want to act so bad. That looks so fun. That does look fun. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=251.0s)]
*  Yeah acting so fun. Really? Have you done it? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=255.0s)]
*  Yeah. I love it. You love it? I love it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=259.0s)]
*  What parts do you love? I hate to say this. Sometimes I like it more [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=263.0s)]
*  than stand up. Damn. I just think it's just [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=267.0s)]
*  different. They're just different. I like being someone else [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=271.0s)]
*  other than myself and like becoming [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=275.0s)]
*  a different character and like actually doing that. I used to do it a lot [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=279.0s)]
*  before I started stand up and then I fell in love with stand up and now I'm just like [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=283.0s)]
*  stand up stand up stand up. You know I kind of feel the exact opposite. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=287.0s)]
*  I like finding a character and finding myself in them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=291.0s)]
*  Like instead of not being myself I like finding a character and then seeing how [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=295.0s)]
*  I would be them. That makes sense. And putting myself in their shoes. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=299.0s)]
*  I love that because then I get to see different perspectives and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=303.0s)]
*  I'm pretty like I have a therapist and he says [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=307.0s)]
*  that I see in black and white. It's either this or that and there's no in between. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=311.0s)]
*  Cognitive distortions. Yeah I do. And so when I'm acting [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=315.0s)]
*  it forces me to have perspective for others. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=319.0s)]
*  Interesting because you're pretending to be a person so you're thinking [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=323.0s)]
*  like a person like that would think. When normally I wouldn't even consider it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=327.0s)]
*  I would be just like this is the way it is. Right. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=331.0s)]
*  So it really opens up a whole. It makes me almost more empathetic and everything. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=335.0s)]
*  It makes me yeah. So I really like it. Because there is something about being [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=339.0s)]
*  able to think just think in gray. You know what I mean. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=343.0s)]
*  So yeah it's really fun. I didn't ever think I would like it but [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=347.0s)]
*  I fucking love it. Oh sorry. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=351.0s)]
*  Who doesn't put their phone on do not disturb. I gotta tell you I don't know who this is. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=355.0s)]
*  It's not a number but the caller ID says try to judge [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=359.0s)]
*  me incorporated. Whoa. Wait that's so weird. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=363.0s)]
*  That's who's calling you? Yeah. You should screenshot that. I am going to. That used to be [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=367.0s)]
*  when I was in my 20s I tried to start a website called try to judge me dot com [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=371.0s)]
*  with Mel. It's you calling me. Yeah that's so weird. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=375.0s)]
*  But yeah. Whoever the don't get involved with them. No. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=379.0s)]
*  Try to judge me. But two was a two. I'm starting out at ten. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=383.0s)]
*  What do we do? Are we in a fight already? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=387.0s)]
*  Whoever this is. Their whole name is an argument. Yeah. But right away. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=391.0s)]
*  Bad energy as soon as you read it. I don't know who that is but don't call me back. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=395.0s)]
*  How many scams do you get like on your phone every day? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=399.0s)]
*  A lot. A lot right? Yeah. How do they get numbers? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=403.0s)]
*  Sometimes they almost trick me. They're like you missed your package. Clip this link and I order so much shit. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=407.0s)]
*  And I'm like oh no. They almost get me sometimes. Yeah. There's so many. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=411.0s)]
*  I got an alert from American Express that says your phone number [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=415.0s)]
*  was leaked on the dark web. Oh no. And I was like that sounds [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=419.0s)]
*  really bad. So I called them and they're like yeah sometimes that happens. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=423.0s)]
*  If you get a lot of scam calls you might have to change your number. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=427.0s)]
*  I'm like who's leaking my number on the fucking dark web? I need to change my number. My number is [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=431.0s)]
*  leaked right now. Well. Currently and I just haven't because it's a pain in the ass. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=435.0s)]
*  Do you think we're ever going to get to a point where numbers [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=439.0s)]
*  are literally going to be like Instagram DMs? Like everyone's just [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=443.0s)]
*  going to be able to get your number? For me it doesn't really make a difference right? Like if someone [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=447.0s)]
*  has your number versus having access to your DMs. No. Can't you [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=451.0s)]
*  just block them? Yeah you definitely could block them but then they could [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=455.0s)]
*  start a new account. There's something about having my number that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=459.0s)]
*  seems a little more threatening than someone just having my. It definitely is but [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=463.0s)]
*  what I'm saying is when you think about it it's kind of the same. Yeah when you think [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=467.0s)]
*  about it that's what's weird. It's kind of if you're responding and you have your [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=471.0s)]
*  announcements turned on. Your notifications turned on. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=475.0s)]
*  Those little DMs are going to show up on your phone just like a text [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=479.0s)]
*  would. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So what are we doing? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=483.0s)]
*  They can't actually call you up but they can. They can go like a friend [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=487.0s)]
*  of mine called me through an Instagram app. That's the scariest. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=491.0s)]
*  I go what is this? How are you doing this? He's like dude you can call people from Instagram. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=495.0s)]
*  Dude you know what I stopped doing? I stopped going. So scary. I went live one time and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=499.0s)]
*  Instagram had requests where people can join your live. I'm like this might be fun taking [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=503.0s)]
*  calls. Nightmare. And I had like a thousand people on that shit and I answered it and this [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=507.0s)]
*  dude just started stripping as quick as he could on the live. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=511.0s)]
*  And I was screaming. I didn't know what to do. Everybody was like leave it on. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=515.0s)]
*  Pressuring me to leave it on. I didn't want to make it not entertaining. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=519.0s)]
*  It was a lot. And that guy just was trying to jerk off as quick as he [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=523.0s)]
*  could on live. And I was like whoa. That sounds scary. So yeah there's a [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=527.0s)]
*  whole world. They can get into your life through via Instagram too. They'll find a way [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=531.0s)]
*  to show you their dicks. Imagine being a dude that likes just sprints [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=535.0s)]
*  to jerk off like the moment people are staring at him. So horny. It's my chance. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=539.0s)]
*  You know what? If you're that horny sprint to jerk off. Do what you need to do to not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=543.0s)]
*  shoot up a school. I don't know what to tell you. I don't think it's horny people shooting up those schools. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=547.0s)]
*  I think it is. I think it's super depressed people. But a little horny too. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=551.0s)]
*  Why horny? Because they're probably a bigger. If you're having regular sex you're less [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=555.0s)]
*  depressed. If you just came you're less likely. Like right after you post not clarity. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=559.0s)]
*  No one's going to shoot up a school right after they just jizzed. Think of the children. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=563.0s)]
*  Well that's probably also part of the depression is that they're not getting any affection. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=567.0s)]
*  Right. You know. Hug your local incel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=571.0s)]
*  There's some broken humans out there. There are. There's just a lot of people that are lonely. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=575.0s)]
*  And they're medicated. Well yeah. You know about broken people. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=579.0s)]
*  When we tried to do. When you opened for Joey. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=583.0s)]
*  Yeah. Do you know this story? How I got my [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=587.0s)]
*  blue check mark. What happened? You know how I got verified on Instagram. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=591.0s)]
*  How? Okay. I've been trying to get verified on Instagram for like 10 years. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=595.0s)]
*  You send in a stupid fucking thing. And you send in [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=599.0s)]
*  the articles that you've been mentioned in and they would always ignore it. And then [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=603.0s)]
*  last year in November. It was October. We opened for Joey [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=607.0s)]
*  at Sony Hall. At Broadway. Sold out show. We were so excited. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=611.0s)]
*  I had the best set. I just had like one of the best [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=615.0s)]
*  sets of my life in the sold out theater. Everyone's like whoa. Like literally standing [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=619.0s)]
*  ovation. Right. I get off stage. I'm going to get my camera that's on a [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=623.0s)]
*  tripod in the back. And like during the chaos that people [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=627.0s)]
*  being like great job. You know you have to walk past people to walk out. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=631.0s)]
*  And then. And some dude pokes my vagina. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=635.0s)]
*  Oh yes. Did you hear this story? Yeah. So he does that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=639.0s)]
*  But then when I turn around to see who does it. He acts like he's blind. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=643.0s)]
*  And disabled. So then immediately I'm like kind of just like [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=647.0s)]
*  my adrenaline's pumping just from the set itself. And then that just happened. And then I see that it's [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=651.0s)]
*  a blind person. So I'm just like overwhelmed. And then people are trying to like say hi. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=655.0s)]
*  You know. Whatever after my set. So I go to sit with Sarah. And I go Sarah like [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=659.0s)]
*  some blind dude just like accidentally poked me in the vagina. And she goes [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=663.0s)]
*  you got assaulted. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=667.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? A blind guy touched you in the pussy. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=671.0s)]
*  She brings me down to reality where I'm like I have like a moment like that's [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=675.0s)]
*  so raven where I go like. And I go like I got touched. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=679.0s)]
*  And it turned into like a whole thing. Oh God. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=683.0s)]
*  Now I'm like kind of pissed. That I even let it. Is the blind guy walking [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=687.0s)]
*  around still? So this story gets crazier Joe. So now Joey's on stage. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=691.0s)]
*  So I'm like I have an hour to find this guy. He came for Joey. There's people [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=695.0s)]
*  at this theater sold out. They're in suits and little you know the ear pieces that they [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=699.0s)]
*  bring for the president. They're doing that whole thing. And I'm [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=703.0s)]
*  I gave them a description. I'm like he looked blind. I don't think he is. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=707.0s)]
*  Chances are he's not really blind. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=711.0s)]
*  And then I'm like shit like I have my camera set up. So I go [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=715.0s)]
*  and look. And you only see the shadows. It's like it's like an SNL sketch. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=719.0s)]
*  The way you can only see certain shadows. And him kind of bump into me and like a something happened [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=723.0s)]
*  and then he walks away and me looking around. But it's just shadows. So I'm like he has this [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=727.0s)]
*  jaw. So we're zooming in on the jaw and he's like comparing the staff [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=731.0s)]
*  is like comparing the pictures on their phones to the people in the crowd. It's so crazy. Everyone's [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=735.0s)]
*  looking for this dude. Then the server comes up and she goes I have a guy in the back throwing up [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=739.0s)]
*  with his friend. He's throwing up in a trash can. I'm like let me go look. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=743.0s)]
*  So I take a peek in the back. I'm like that's him. Immediately. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=747.0s)]
*  And you know what's fucked up is that he looked a lot like this [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=751.0s)]
*  guy I know that works at Gas Digital. For Lewis who's blind. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=755.0s)]
*  He looks like they call him gay blind Mike at Gas Digital. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=759.0s)]
*  And he looks a lot like him. So I thought I was being like gay racist. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=763.0s)]
*  You mean blind racist? Blind. Yeah. Blind racist. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=767.0s)]
*  Where I was like maybe all blind people look alike. Oh my god. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=771.0s)]
*  So [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=775.0s)]
*  I was like it's him. So then they're like we'll take care of it [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=779.0s)]
*  and they start escorting him out and I guess he gets away and runs out. Right? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=783.0s)]
*  Before they can get his ID and his information which annoys me. But I'm gonna let it go. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=787.0s)]
*  They're like he got away. But wasn't he so drunk he was throwing up in a trash can [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=791.0s)]
*  and they can't catch him? No. I don't know how he got away. I wasn't there to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=795.0s)]
*  see it. That's why I should have been there. But then it gets crazier. But then I'm like kind of [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=799.0s)]
*  pissed that he got away because I'm like he just got away with that. And then I'm like gaslighting [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=803.0s)]
*  myself. Did he even do it on purpose? He was so drunk. And they go well we know it was him for sure. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=807.0s)]
*  And I go how do you know it was him? They go oh on his way out he said at least I got to [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=811.0s)]
*  touch Kim Kongden's pussy. So then. So then [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=815.0s)]
*  I mean this is like at this point Joey's off stage. I haven't even told him what happened. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=819.0s)]
*  I'm in the green room. I'm drinking champagne. It was a huge party in the green room. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=823.0s)]
*  And I just got told this by the door. And without saying anything [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=827.0s)]
*  to anyone I just get up and I go outside. I just beeline it [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=831.0s)]
*  for the exit. And I'm like in security I can hear them trying to keep up with me. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=835.0s)]
*  And I'm like kicking doors open. I'm fucking pissed now. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=839.0s)]
*  Because now I'm like he did it on fucking purpose. And he's a fan and he knows my name. And like [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=843.0s)]
*  now it's a problem for me. You know. And then I don't even know if I should say [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=847.0s)]
*  the next part. But I found him outside. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=851.0s)]
*  Should you not say this part? I found him outside. She found him outside. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=855.0s)]
*  I found him outside. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=859.0s)]
*  And then they were like doing a call to cops. I was like no. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=863.0s)]
*  She took care of it herself. That's yeah. One thing about mom is she [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=867.0s)]
*  going to do it herself. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah like no one would be mad at you for doing that. No. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=875.0s)]
*  Especially it's a guy. You started with a bitch slap. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=879.0s)]
*  That's all I'll say. Started with that? Yeah. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=883.0s)]
*  Yeah. I started with that. How drunk was he? Like was he recognizing [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=887.0s)]
*  that he fucked up? Like what was he thinking? Well he said that on his way out. So he was [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=891.0s)]
*  proud of it. That's the thing that pissed me off. I would have let it almost go. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=895.0s)]
*  Because I was like he's drunk. But the fact that he said that he had like nerves still. You know what I mean? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=899.0s)]
*  He was sober enough to be a fucking dick. So you're sober enough to get your ass kicked. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=903.0s)]
*  The whole night went different. Because I was like my friend got touched. We're getting Chinese [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=907.0s)]
*  food. Also it was horrible because when I kicked open the door [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=911.0s)]
*  there was a bunch of fans outside. Because Joey just ended so they're all waiting to say hi. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=915.0s)]
*  And I just had a great set. So they immediately remember [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=919.0s)]
*  my name and I have all these fans there going Kim. And I say nothing past them. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=923.0s)]
*  All they see is me kick open the door. Go past them. I mean [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=927.0s)]
*  absolutely from the hip like I'm throwing a hook. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=931.0s)]
*  Open hand. Drop someone. Dropped him with an open [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=935.0s)]
*  hand. And then yeah. But then there was a [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=939.0s)]
*  variety article about it. And that's how this bitch got verified. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=943.0s)]
*  She used that article to get her checkmarked. That was the checkmark. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=947.0s)]
*  That was how I got my verified checkmark. And honestly [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=951.0s)]
*  worth it. I was like oh [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=955.0s)]
*  that's all it took? I wish a blind man would come touch my [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=959.0s)]
*  vagina. Be careful what you wish for. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=963.0s)]
*  Don't wish for that out loud. She's joking everyone. If there's a blind [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=967.0s)]
*  man in there that's like I've been waiting for my time. That's the dude who gets his strategies [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=971.0s)]
*  from like a Scooby Doo episode. Just pretend you're blind. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=975.0s)]
*  Well I'm a dumbass. I fell for it. I was like oh he was blind. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=979.0s)]
*  Did he have a cane? No. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=983.0s)]
*  Who the fuck is blind and just walks out without a cane? I didn't have time to think about it. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=987.0s)]
*  I don't think about the habits of the blind post show. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=991.0s)]
*  Post show, post touch. Right post touch. And then [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=995.0s)]
*  afterwards we saw those like LED balloons that light up. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=999.0s)]
*  The clear ones that Disney sells. Sarah was trying to make me feel better in any way. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1003.0s)]
*  She's like I'll get you Chinese. Do you want an egg roll? I'll buy it. You got touched. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1007.0s)]
*  She kept saying that. She kept saying you got touched. And everybody kept treating me. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1011.0s)]
*  When mommy gets touched, mama eats Chinese too. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1015.0s)]
*  And then she tried to buy me the balloon. And I was like I don't want a balloon. She's like you love those balloons. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1019.0s)]
*  She remembered I mentioned them before. She was like you love those balloons. I'll get that balloon for you. You got touched. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1023.0s)]
*  So she literally, I'm like Sarah no. She's like no I'm getting it. And she opens the door [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1027.0s)]
*  and she goes to get the balloon and they like literally drive off as she's like walking. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1031.0s)]
*  And she has to come back and tell me. I'm like sorry you're not getting the balloon and you got [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1035.0s)]
*  touched. And so now every time I see that balloon. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1039.0s)]
*  I know. And I was going to get you one of them for your birthday. I was like no. I know she likes [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1043.0s)]
*  those balloons but it's going to remind her of getting touched. Jesus. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1047.0s)]
*  But now we just bring it up every time we want to tell the story. I got verified [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1051.0s)]
*  anyways. That's the most hilarious way to get verified. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1055.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. Yeah it was really funny. I was at the comedy store telling people that. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1059.0s)]
*  So I got touched for a blue check mark. And then I was telling them how my mom was coming into town [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1063.0s)]
*  and how she's kind of crazy and a little wild. You've met my mom before. A little crazy. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1067.0s)]
*  And she, I made her dye her hair [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1071.0s)]
*  back because she dyed it blue. Bright blue. And I was like don't [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1075.0s)]
*  come to LA with blue hair please. So I was like go back to blonde. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1079.0s)]
*  I was like please. Change your bob. Change your hair. Oh that's hilarious. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1083.0s)]
*  Well she was thinking about it and I encouraged it. And then I was like [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1087.0s)]
*  yeah dye your hair back. And then I was telling that story and I was like I don't know. My mom's just crazy [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1091.0s)]
*  and she likes to party a lot. I was like I don't know what happened to her. She has blue hair and someone goes [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1095.0s)]
*  that's her blue check mark. I was like oh [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1099.0s)]
*  shit. Oh shit. Isn't it weird that Twitter [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1103.0s)]
*  like Twitter you pay for a check mark right? Yeah. Yeah that [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1107.0s)]
*  went. And Instagram now. Instagram too? So does [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1111.0s)]
*  that mean, but you can pretend to be, can you pretend to be somebody? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1115.0s)]
*  Not really. I mean you can, you can, no anyone can get a check mark. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1119.0s)]
*  It's kind of obvious when someone's pretending though. But a verification, what does it [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1123.0s)]
*  mean? Nothing anymore. So like if you have just a regular account and you have a blue check [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1127.0s)]
*  mark does it give you access to other things? Like what's the [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1131.0s)]
*  point of it? I think it's just like to have one. There's people that get blue [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1135.0s)]
*  check marks and then they try to like reach out to people who also have blue check marks [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1139.0s)]
*  to like collaborate. You know what I mean? And they're like oh [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1143.0s)]
*  I have a blue check mark so I'm really official now. And it makes it like seem [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1147.0s)]
*  like. But you can tell because they have like 16 likes. Yeah. What used to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1151.0s)]
*  make sense is if it was, if like the Sarah Weinschenk [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1155.0s)]
*  Twitter account was verified because you're a person, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1159.0s)]
*  a public person. Right. So that makes sense. That should be verified. Right. Like everybody [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1163.0s)]
*  knows this is her so if there's a fake one, which there probably is a bunch of them, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1167.0s)]
*  everybody knows the difference between the real one and the fake one. The real one is the blue check mark. But if you [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1171.0s)]
*  just buy a blue check mark. It doesn't matter anymore. What does that mean now? Yeah. No I know [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1175.0s)]
*  they kind of lost value when you could buy one. Everybody was saying that. Especially for people [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1179.0s)]
*  like journalists or politicians because if you can fake being [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1183.0s)]
*  them and just get traction on tweets. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yeah. I'm sure those Russian troll farms do shit like that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1191.0s)]
*  I'm sure they do that. I'm sure they make fake accounts. I'm sure they do. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1195.0s)]
*  They have thousands. Who knows how many they have. They found that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1199.0s)]
*  19 of the top 20 Facebook Christian webpages [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1203.0s)]
*  were run by Russian troll farms. 19. Whoa. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1207.0s)]
*  That's so funny. It's wild. They just turn in people on each other. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1211.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. Yeah. Well I'm waiting for the day that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1215.0s)]
*  Riles up. Ripant. Ripant. Ripant. Jesus is coming. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1219.0s)]
*  I'm waiting for the day that internet, the solar flare happens and we all go down. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1223.0s)]
*  That could happen. That could happen. That's very likely. When? Very soon right? [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1227.0s)]
*  It's very unpredictable how the sun works. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1231.0s)]
*  I mean not how it works like physically to understand it but like whether or not you get flares. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1235.0s)]
*  And some of these flares. Have you ever seen what it looks like when you see a [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1239.0s)]
*  solar flare superimposed with a picture of Earth like the size of [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1243.0s)]
*  Earth. It's wild how big these things are. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1247.0s)]
*  Really? They are so huge. The fucking [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1251.0s)]
*  sun is so gigantic. It's not even a big sun. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1255.0s)]
*  It's so insane when you look at it in comparison to the rest of the solar system. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1259.0s)]
*  Is this tomorrow? There's a solar flare tomorrow? Tomorrow. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1263.0s)]
*  God damn it Jamie. There's a solar flare tomorrow? You know I always said that I wanted [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1267.0s)]
*  the end of the world to happen when I'm near Joe Rogan. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1271.0s)]
*  Listen we'll be okay. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1275.0s)]
*  Sweetie I'll be banging on your gate or wherever you live. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1279.0s)]
*  I'll show you. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1283.0s)]
*  Just me and my mom. Her hair is not blue anymore. Can your mom shoot? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1287.0s)]
*  I just went shooting. You guys went shooting together. She actually can shoot. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1291.0s)]
*  I can shoot. You should have seen my little thing. So listen to what it says. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1295.0s)]
*  It says NASA predicts radio and GPS blackout on November 30. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1299.0s)]
*  That's two days from now. It's one day. One day? Tomorrow. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1303.0s)]
*  Oh great. They're going to bring the aliens in tomorrow. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1307.0s)]
*  Due to a coronal mass ejection. Okay now look at [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1311.0s)]
*  coronal mass ejection. I'm scared. Look what these things look like. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1315.0s)]
*  And this is on like the NASA website? And it's tomorrow? Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1319.0s)]
*  This pod's not coming out. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1323.0s)]
*  Look at this fucking thing that's hovering [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1327.0s)]
*  in space that keeps us alive. It looks like a hot Cheeto. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1331.0s)]
*  Imagine that we need this thing to generate [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1335.0s)]
*  heat. And if it doesn't generate heat, we're dead. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1339.0s)]
*  We rely on a nuclear power plant for the whole universe. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1343.0s)]
*  Yeah but you know when you were talking about the guy that you have tattooed on you, the Five Rings guy? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1347.0s)]
*  The Samurai. It's kind of like when I look at the sun I also think of my heart [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1351.0s)]
*  where I'm like I need it to pump every time to survive. Where I'm like [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1355.0s)]
*  it's all the same thing. Where it's like one little adjustment almost anywhere. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1359.0s)]
*  Anywhere. It's over. That's fucked dude. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1363.0s)]
*  That's fucked. The balance between life and death with Earth [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1367.0s)]
*  all we have to do is just get a little further from the sun and we're [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1371.0s)]
*  fucksville. And everything freezes. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1375.0s)]
*  One little shift in gravity. That's so scary. And apparently if our [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1379.0s)]
*  moon wasn't there, our moon is so large that it keeps our orbit [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1383.0s)]
*  and our weather fairly [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1387.0s)]
*  stable. There's something about the Earth being [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1391.0s)]
*  and it keeps our, I'm fucking this up for sure, but there's something about [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1395.0s)]
*  the Earth being balanced by the moon [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1399.0s)]
*  that it helps sustain life. Which is one of the reasons [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1403.0s)]
*  why some people are wondering why they're not seeing life on other planets. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1407.0s)]
*  What is it about Earth? And it seems one of the things about Earth is the [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1411.0s)]
*  stability that the moon gives us. I'm not sure, find out what it does. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1415.0s)]
*  I was going to ask if, you remind me of this video I saw just recently. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1419.0s)]
*  Have you seen this before? Fresh take on the origin of Earth's moon. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1423.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus. That's a jellyfish. This is like when the big [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1427.0s)]
*  bang happened. So this is Earth, this glowing ball moving. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1431.0s)]
*  And something went by it and hit it and that created the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1435.0s)]
*  moon. And that's what's still like, these are giant. Well that's [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1439.0s)]
*  Earth one and Earth two. Look it just reabsorbed. And this is [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1443.0s)]
*  going to be the moon here. But like that happened over thousands and [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1447.0s)]
*  thousands and thousands of years. Yeah, that's what they think. The moon's [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1451.0s)]
*  for sure a woman. We've talked about it before. Look at that, like that's what happened. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1455.0s)]
*  Two planets collided kids. It's kind of sexual. Holy shit is it [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1459.0s)]
*  sexual because it created everything. They smashed. And it's the same [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1463.0s)]
*  thing as the other things. Everything's the same. Not to be so high [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1467.0s)]
*  about it. What do you mean? It's the same thing as everything else. It's literally [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1471.0s)]
*  is sexual. It's like having two people come together and have a child. Yeah. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1475.0s)]
*  It's trippy. All of those like solar nurseries, have you [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1479.0s)]
*  seen those? The stellar nurseries. They're just the [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1483.0s)]
*  wildest formations of galaxies where these galaxies [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1487.0s)]
*  are coming out of this [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1491.0s)]
*  stellar nursery. It's fucking nuts when you see them. Have you seen the video where they [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1495.0s)]
*  go to Earth and then they pull out and just show you where you are? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1499.0s)]
*  Oh it's sick. This is a stellar nursery visualization. What? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1503.0s)]
*  Yeah. This is something that exists 6,500 [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1507.0s)]
*  light years away. That is so cool looking. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1511.0s)]
*  Fucking wild. I want to go there. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1515.0s)]
*  That was like a wizard in a hat holding something up. It does. It really does. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1519.0s)]
*  I mean how fucking insane is this? This is nuts. What is that even? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1523.0s)]
*  I don't understand it. But whatever this visualization is I would love to see [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1527.0s)]
*  like what perspective we're looking at. Like how big is this? How big is it? Is it [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1531.0s)]
*  a physical thing you can land on? I don't know what the fuck it is. It makes me feel [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1535.0s)]
*  more spiritual. It looks like a waterfall. Look it. It looks like a waterfall. When I see that. It looks like some [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1539.0s)]
*  avatar shit. It does. It really does. It's beautiful. This is like what [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1543.0s)]
*  the mother would give through the tree. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1547.0s)]
*  Wind from stars? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1555.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1559.0s)]
*  It's gassed? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1565.0s)]
*  Embryonic stars. Our eyes couldn't see that without this data. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1569.0s)]
*  That was crazy. But like [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1573.0s)]
*  when you see shit like this it makes me feel like there has to be a god. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1577.0s)]
*  No but this is my question. I think the universe is god. I do too. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1581.0s)]
*  Can I ask you a serious question? If you have to. And it might be really dumb. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1585.0s)]
*  It might be really dumb. How did they get that footage? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1589.0s)]
*  It's not real footage. So how do we know? [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1593.0s)]
*  Well because they use various imaging tools to get an understanding [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1597.0s)]
*  of what's out there. And the greatest one they're using right now [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1601.0s)]
*  is the web. They've got this new telescope that is [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1605.0s)]
*  getting these insane shots of like deep space. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1609.0s)]
*  A lot of it is computer generated. So a lot of what you see [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1613.0s)]
*  when you see these images is computer generated. But there's some real images [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1617.0s)]
*  that are not as impressive. It's kind of different. So this computer generated [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1621.0s)]
*  stuff when they're showing you like the stellar nursery. Like that's [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1625.0s)]
*  I don't believe that's what it really looks like. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1629.0s)]
*  With infrared light. But how detailed are their [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1633.0s)]
*  infrareds? Like how much are they guessing? Cause I know they add color to these things. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1637.0s)]
*  They do a lot of stuff. So it's computer generated to a certain extent. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1641.0s)]
*  But either way it's fucking just what they're discovering [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1645.0s)]
*  is just a wild. It's beautiful. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1649.0s)]
*  The nuttiest speculation that Brian Keating hates. But some people are speculating that the [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1653.0s)]
*  universe is a lot older than they thought it was. They think that the Big Bang instead of 13.7 [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1657.0s)]
*  billion years was somewhere around like 22 or 24 billion years ago. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1661.0s)]
*  It seemed a little close for me sweetie. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1665.0s)]
*  It's something about the creation of galaxies. That galaxies are [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1669.0s)]
*  created too far away. Cause the further they can look. Something like that. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1673.0s)]
*  I'm good. There's some wacky shit. But the point [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1677.0s)]
*  is like there's so much that they don't know already. There's so many planets [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1681.0s)]
*  that no idea what's out there. Isn't there one that's just like [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1685.0s)]
*  Earth is called like some I don't know what it's called. I do not know. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1689.0s)]
*  I think they've found a few that are in the Goldilocks zone. Ooh the Goldilocks [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1693.0s)]
*  zone. That's you know not too hot, not too cold. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1697.0s)]
*  This one is just right. That's where Earth is too. Yeah. Yep. That's [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1701.0s)]
*  exactly it. Yeah. Earth is in the Goldilocks zone. It's crazy. It's crazy. We're so [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1705.0s)]
*  lucky. We're super lucky but we're also not lucky. Cause we're [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1709.0s)]
*  in the middle of a comet storm. Every September and [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1713.0s)]
*  no June and November we pass through these comet storms. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1717.0s)]
*  Here's a for instance of like this is a website on how to get this [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1721.0s)]
*  I guess we could download this data from the web telescope and process these images [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1725.0s)]
*  ourself. So this is what it looks like I guess when you first get some of the first pictures. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1729.0s)]
*  That's beautiful too. Processed it black and white and then he took [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1733.0s)]
*  that and made it. See I kind of would rather just look at the other one. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1737.0s)]
*  You know. Yeah the other one was sick. Cause this is real. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1741.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know. This is what you can really show me. Put a filter on it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1745.0s)]
*  Don't do the Samsung thing. You know what Samsung did with the [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1749.0s)]
*  moon view. Oh I was such a sucker. I was showing everybody. Oh yeah yeah yeah. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1753.0s)]
*  The moon bro. Because you know when you take a photo with your iPhone and you're like [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1757.0s)]
*  it doesn't do it justice. Samsung did some shit where it enhances [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1761.0s)]
*  it. Yeah it's called lying. Yeah it didn't. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1765.0s)]
*  Maybe filter in the moon Samsung. I was just going to say they have amazing cameras. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1769.0s)]
*  Well Samsung phones have wicked cameras. They really do. And they're like all [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1773.0s)]
*  battling with each other for who has the best camera whether it's iPhone or I like the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1777.0s)]
*  iPhone operating system better but Samsung has some wicked fucking cameras. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1781.0s)]
*  So anyway what it actually does is it just [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1785.0s)]
*  knows what the moon looks like and it puts a fucking detailed photo of the moon [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1789.0s)]
*  over whatever blurry shit you have. And these kids found it out because [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1793.0s)]
*  this dude set up a picture [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1797.0s)]
*  of a blurry picture of the moon on a [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1801.0s)]
*  screen a monitor and then backed up and filmed [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1805.0s)]
*  it and it gave him a perfectly detailed photo of the moon. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1809.0s)]
*  They play dirty. Wow. They play [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1813.0s)]
*  super dirty. What a smart kid. I know but I was such a [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1817.0s)]
*  sucker I was like dude Samsung phones look fucking [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1821.0s)]
*  bitch ass iPhone. Look at this thing you can't do this. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1825.0s)]
*  I wish the iPhone had that too kind of. Yeah lie to me. You know what? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1829.0s)]
*  Everybody lie to me. I want a sexier picture of the moon. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1833.0s)]
*  I took this picture. Total bullshit [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1837.0s)]
*  computer generated nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1841.0s)]
*  It's weird. The whole filters thing is weird when people use filters [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1845.0s)]
*  for videos and you're like hey man I know you don't look like that. Yeah. Like this is [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1849.0s)]
*  crazy. Hell yeah. Like what are you doing? Are you animated though? Yeah. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1853.0s)]
*  You know what's really dark? Remember that wish.com thing? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1857.0s)]
*  What's wish.com? We were at Skank Fest. We had a [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1861.0s)]
*  filter picture that we put filters on and we posted and then someone posted [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1865.0s)]
*  a real video of us and said Kim Congdon on [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1869.0s)]
*  Wish. Kim Congdon and Sarah you order. Kim and Sarah that you [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1873.0s)]
*  ordered the Kim Congdon from Wish or whatever. Yeah yeah yeah. I was like us without a [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1877.0s)]
*  filter. So that's where it'll get you. If you start using filters then you [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1881.0s)]
*  can't really. It actually makes you look worse in real life. I think. And [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1885.0s)]
*  it's making everyone look worse. Inside our lifetime they're going to reverse aging. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1889.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. Inside our lifetime. I've actually always believed [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1893.0s)]
*  that so I really like to hear you say that. I've been terrified of death my whole [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1897.0s)]
*  life and I've just convinced myself to feel better that by the time I'm not old I [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1901.0s)]
*  can go back. I think they're working really hard on it [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1905.0s)]
*  and they're coming very close and I think there's going to be some improvements in [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1909.0s)]
*  whether it's you know whether it's pharmaceutical [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1913.0s)]
*  drugs or medical technology. They're going to figure something out. Cause it's a simulation [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1917.0s)]
*  and we don't actually ever end. That's what Bert Kreischer says. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1921.0s)]
*  He goes I don't believe you die. Prove it. Yeah. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1925.0s)]
*  I don't think you have to die. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1929.0s)]
*  No I've read into that. That's a mental illness that comics have. I have that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1933.0s)]
*  too. I'm like I'll never die. It's like you are like in such denial. I've accepted [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1937.0s)]
*  it. No I'm like. Death? Yeah. I feel like [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1941.0s)]
*  if you think of the fact that you're going to die it makes you live every day differently. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1945.0s)]
*  No. That's how I feel. Well it [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1949.0s)]
*  definitely will if you feel that way. Yeah I think about it all the time and instead [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1953.0s)]
*  of like fearing it I'm like okay well fuck it I'm having the burrito. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1957.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's not Chinese food or burritos. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1961.0s)]
*  Sometimes you've got to self care as a burrito. Yeah [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1965.0s)]
*  if you live your life with the gratitude that you're [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1969.0s)]
*  alive you'll do better. That I do. For whatever reason. If it's because you realize you're [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1973.0s)]
*  going to die or it's because you're just happy to be alive. I'm genuinely grateful. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1977.0s)]
*  I'm like we're very lucky. We're all very lucky. Me and my friends are all lucky. We get to hang [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1981.0s)]
*  out with the funniest people in the world. We were all talking about it last night in the green room. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1985.0s)]
*  What a fun hang it is. We're so lucky. We're so lucky. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1989.0s)]
*  We're really lucky. We really are. We had so much fun last night. It was so silly. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1993.0s)]
*  So much fun. It's so silly. It's the best hang. If I'm not around [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=1997.0s)]
*  comedians I get homesick for them. That's what Stan Hobe said. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2001.0s)]
*  He goes I could quit comedy but I couldn't quit comedians. Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2005.0s)]
*  It's really about the comics. The hang for me. The hang is the most fun. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2009.0s)]
*  That's why I got into it. I gotta tell you. The hang was it. It's the clubhouse. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2013.0s)]
*  Ron White always says it. He's like we got our own clubhouse. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2017.0s)]
*  It is. Comics clubhouse. That's what he's saying when I'm knocking on the door. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2021.0s)]
*  Can I come in? He's like no. You get set up in there too with the timers [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2025.0s)]
*  and the screens. It's so perfect. You don't have to worry [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2029.0s)]
*  about even like you've taken every single worry about a comedy [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2033.0s)]
*  club away too. When I'm at clubs I can't even relax in the green room because I'm like running out [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2037.0s)]
*  asking the host how long do they have? When do I have to go up? You just sit there. You see the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2041.0s)]
*  timer. You see them on stage. You see the fucking clock. There's lights everywhere. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2045.0s)]
*  There's lights everywhere. It's right there. There's a light in the hallway. There's a light right [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2049.0s)]
*  above the stage in the back. It's great. I have a question. Okay. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2053.0s)]
*  Do you believe in reincarnation? I don't not believe in it. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2057.0s)]
*  Do you think you were something else in a past life? I don't know. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2061.0s)]
*  Sometimes I think I was a 1950s housewife in a past life. Like I'm overly [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2065.0s)]
*  connected to that time period and I'm like was I a 1950s housewife? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2069.0s)]
*  She comes when she gets hit. Is this from dreams? Yeah. Dreams like what [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2073.0s)]
*  do you ever wonder? Like what if you ever have repeating dreams? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2077.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh my gosh. I had to see a doctor because I had the same dream for five years. What is [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2081.0s)]
*  it? I was at this beach. It was my college town and I was at this beach [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2085.0s)]
*  and I would be in a haunted house. I would have to stay at this haunted place that I was moving [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2089.0s)]

*  like scared. Remember we found out I was also having the same dream? Yeah. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2097.0s)]
*  We were going to the same places in our dreams. But I also saw on TikTok that a lot of [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2101.0s)]
*  people were going to the same dream that I was going to. What? Yeah. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2105.0s)]

*  for a while until I found that TikTok of a bunch of people saying [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2121.0s)]
*  I've been here too and then describing it. And even down to people [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2125.0s)]
*  saying like oh my- someone even like- and then you can see how many [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2129.0s)]
*  people agree by all the likes. There was one that had like a lot of likes and said I go to [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2133.0s)]
*  the beach every night too. The same exact beach except I have to stay in a haunted [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2137.0s)]
*  condo. One, two, Freddy's coming for you. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2141.0s)]

*  But imagine if it just starts happening. Imagine if we've done so much [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2149.0s)]
*  bad to the earth that we've really opened up Satan and demons [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2153.0s)]

*  This is worse than the solar flares. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2165.0s)]
*  Imagine you can't go to sleep but you're always tired. If you go to sleep Freddy's waiting for you. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2169.0s)]
*  The music. I don't like it. Imagine if [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2173.0s)]
*  everybody really starts going to the same place in their dreams and then some people [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2177.0s)]
*  start dying. I don't like it. Some people start dying. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2181.0s)]
*  At first they blame it on the vaccine of course. But then they start realizing [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2185.0s)]
*  no these people are all dying of internal hemorrhaging. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2189.0s)]
*  That we can't really discern what's coming from while they're sleeping. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2193.0s)]
*  This is just a new disease. What's happening? No, no, no, no. They're getting eviscerated by demons. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2197.0s)]
*  I don't want to be eviscerated by demons at night. You're getting eviscerated by [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2201.0s)]
*  demons in your sleep. And then you wake up. You know it's a dream. You know if you wake up you can get away. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2205.0s)]
*  I don't know what that cross joint did to you. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2209.0s)]
*  You're always going to want to go back to sleep though. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2213.0s)]
*  And every time you go back to sleep they're just ready and running at you. And you're tired. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2217.0s)]

*  too heavy. You're like God why am I so tired so quick? I gotta run faster. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2225.0s)]
*  What if you just started making horror films? And the demons [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2229.0s)]
*  they know exactly how fast you can run. Look he won't give up. He won't. So they just run. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2233.0s)]
*  Just at your heels. I don't like demons nipping at my heels. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2237.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm being demon hypnotized. And they're laughing because they know you're scared. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2241.0s)]
*  They love it when you're scared. That's what they want. They want you to be scared. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2245.0s)]
*  So they're laughing. They're laughing right behind you because they know you can't get away. But they're just running [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2249.0s)]
*  just fast. They're not even worried. Not worried at all. They're demons. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2253.0s)]
*  They're holding little pitchforks. And they're laughing. And as they're laughing you're getting [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2257.0s)]
*  more scared because you know you can't run much longer. Do you think it would be fun to have sex with a demon? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2261.0s)]
*  For the first few seconds. I do too. You're like fuck you mom. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2265.0s)]
*  Show me [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2269.0s)]
*  that pitchfork. That's exactly [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2273.0s)]
*  how it feels. Proud to be dad. This is for everything you've done for me. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2277.0s)]
*  Mascara runs down. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2281.0s)]
*  And then you feel the scales. No. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2285.0s)]
*  I have a reoccurring nightmare that I'm back in college and I have [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2289.0s)]
*  a calculus test. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2293.0s)]
*  Yeah that's a, I'm scared I'm not going to graduate. Yes it's reoccurring [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2297.0s)]
*  like all the time. I used to have dreams that I failed [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2301.0s)]
*  one of my exams that I had to go back to high school. Yes I have that often. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2305.0s)]
*  Like reoccurring. And also my teeth fall out. I had one [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2309.0s)]
*  of those one time. I touch one and then they go like dominoes. And they all [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2313.0s)]
*  fall out. I'm like no. There's supposed to be some connection with that. They say [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2317.0s)]
*  people doubt. You feel like you don't have control of your life. Yeah that seems [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2321.0s)]
*  about right. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2325.0s)]
*  You nailed it Joe. I mean who does? I'm really perceptive [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2329.0s)]
*  guys. I don't know if I've told you that. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2333.0s)]
*  Yeah no. Fucked up dreams. You know I had a friend pass away like [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2337.0s)]
*  seven years ago. And this is really, this is scary, not scary [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2341.0s)]
*  it's pretty trippy but very true. I was dating someone at this time and he was [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2345.0s)]
*  sitting with me. And I had, I never had night terrors where I woke up out of my [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2349.0s)]
*  sleep ever in my entire life. And I had one one night where I woke up. Cause I had a [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2353.0s)]
*  dream that someone came in my room while I was watching TV at night in my bed [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2357.0s)]
*  and they were wearing a hoodie. I couldn't see their face. And their face was like blacked out. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2361.0s)]
*  And they sat next to me in bed and then pulled out a gun and shot themselves [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2365.0s)]
*  in the head and died next to me. And it was someone, and I could tell it was someone [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2369.0s)]
*  I cared about because they wasn't scared when they were sitting next to me. It felt like a friend. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2373.0s)]
*  And I said like why did you do that in my dream? And the person said I'm sorry I'm [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2377.0s)]
*  dying. And then three hours later I got a call that my best friend died. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2381.0s)]
*  And that was the dream I had that night. And it was the only dream that's ever woken me up out of my [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2385.0s)]
*  sleep. Where I was like so terrified I woke up. Kim, Kim [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2389.0s)]
*  is a little intuitive. It was really weird. Well Kim's a little nutty. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2393.0s)]
*  She is. And most nutty people they can sense some [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2397.0s)]
*  things that, like you ever wonder like schizophrenics when they're running around [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2401.0s)]
*  talking to themselves. Are you saying I'm schizophrenic? No, no, no, no, I'm not. I'm not. But if you ever [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2405.0s)]
*  wonder, maybe someone's talking back to them. I think that all the [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2409.0s)]
*  time because sometimes I hear them say things that make sense. Well, yeah [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2413.0s)]
*  I mean I also was, I went into a, when Brody died I went into [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2417.0s)]
*  an actual psychosis. I was taking Adderall for [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2421.0s)]
*  a lot of years. And then I stopped taking it suddenly because I wanted to [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2425.0s)]
*  sleep and I was so sad that he had died. I abruptly stopped taking Adderall. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2429.0s)]
*  And it put me in like this wild psychosis. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2433.0s)]
*  And now I talk about it all the time because it's so mass prescribed. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2437.0s)]
*  It's insane. Well it's an amphetamine. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2441.0s)]
*  It's meth. Well it's better. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2445.0s)]
*  If you're going to take one I'd take Adderall. It's better. It seems like they have it dialed in. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2449.0s)]
*  As much as they can. You know exactly what you're going to get. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2453.0s)]
*  The dosage. Isn't it fascinating that it's okay to take that? I mean [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2457.0s)]
*  they say you need it for ADD. It made me. You say you need it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2461.0s)]
*  It really like, because I got, I started taking it in college right? Because I was like I gotta [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2465.0s)]
*  do this paper. You know? Because as a society we put so much [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2469.0s)]
*  we put a spotlight on productivity. It's like how productive are you being? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2473.0s)]
*  And not really on well being. And because of that I got really [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2477.0s)]
*  addicted to it. And then when I started stand up I was like a personal assistant during the day. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2481.0s)]
*  So I'd be like on Excel sheets all day. And then going to do [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2485.0s)]
*  stand up. And so just like awake and awake and awake for like [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2489.0s)]
*  10 years. And then I'm like it's really nice to sleep. Not being on Adderall. I'm like [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2493.0s)]
*  it's so nice sleeping. Were you able to sleep when you were on Adderall? No. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2497.0s)]
*  So how many hours a night do you think you slept? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2501.0s)]
*  Probably like four. Whoa. And they weren't real, it wasn't even [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2505.0s)]
*  real sleep. Damn. Because then you get like a tolerance to it right? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2509.0s)]
*  And the company that fucking, listen this shit's crazy. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2513.0s)]
*  The company that, okay to get Adderall there is this place [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2517.0s)]
*  I went on Yelp and typed in Adderall. This place [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2521.0s)]
*  comes up. Jesus. I'm not joking. This place comes up. The doctor who [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2525.0s)]
*  prescribed it to me is now in jail because he [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2529.0s)]
*  was prescribing stuff to people like willy nilly. Yeah. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2533.0s)]
*  That's real common. It's really scary. Well a lot of these doctors are also [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2537.0s)]
*  taking these things. Which is interesting. Because if you're [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2541.0s)]
*  a doctor and you know that these things work and you [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2545.0s)]
*  decide that you have ADD or whatever and you go to your other doctor friend [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2549.0s)]
*  and he writes a prescription for you. Right. And now you're taking Adderall [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2553.0s)]
*  and you need it. Because you need it. Like a lot of people just think they need [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2557.0s)]
*  it because it is probably great. Like I haven't done [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2561.0s)]
*  it. I'm scared. I'm scared I'd like it. Oh no you'd like it. That's the problem. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2565.0s)]
*  I like the trauma tapping you did. This is how it, no no no. Did you see that? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2569.0s)]
*  You know why? It was like having a flashback. It was. It was an Adderall flashback. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2573.0s)]
*  I'm like I'm typing on a computer. Yeah. That's what it reminded me of. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2577.0s)]
*  But yeah when you went through that that was like fucking [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2581.0s)]
*  crazy. It was so scary. It was crazy. It was really scary. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2585.0s)]
*  I called the cops on her. My parents did too. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2589.0s)]
*  Look it's hard. People get hooked on pills. There's a lot of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2593.0s)]
*  pills that can get you hooked. I'm grateful every day to not be on it. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2597.0s)]
*  Brandon Shaw broke his nose in a fight. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2601.0s)]
*  We fought Mirko Krokop and he got his nose smashed. And he had to get his nose fixed. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2605.0s)]
*  And they put him on Oxy's. And so [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2609.0s)]
*  he took the Oxy's, got the surgery. His nose was destroyed. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2613.0s)]
*  Gets the, takes the Oxy's and then [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2617.0s)]
*  just keeps taking them. Just keeps. Like long [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2621.0s)]
*  after the healing process he's fucking taking them all day long. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2625.0s)]
*  And then finally his friends just came over to his house and took everything away. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2629.0s)]
*  And he's like hey dude you gotta stop. But it was hard. He said it was [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2633.0s)]
*  fucking hard. It was really hard to get off of Adderall too. And then now [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2637.0s)]
*  I know I have some friends who are still on it and there's like a shortage of it. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2641.0s)]
*  And there's people that are hooked on it and there's this shortage of it [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2645.0s)]
*  like nationwide. And it's really fucking people's shit up because they've been [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2649.0s)]
*  taking it for so long. Right and then the problem is then they go for street Adderall. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2653.0s)]
*  Which is cut with fentanyl. Well also a lot of people get on Adderall [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2657.0s)]
*  because they want to lose weight. Because it makes you skinny. Makes you not hungry. No it's so fucked up. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2661.0s)]
*  That was one of the benefits for me too. I was like I'm skinny and I'm a perfectionist. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2665.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like so easy for women to get [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2669.0s)]
*  addicted because you're just losing weight and being productive. You're like I can do it all. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2673.0s)]
*  Exactly what you're supposed to be doing. You're like I baked a pie and also [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2677.0s)]
*  called my grandmother and said hello. And the house is clean and I'm a stand up comedian. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2681.0s)]
*  And my hair is done. I'm telling you right now I don't remember who said this [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2685.0s)]
*  but it was a famous woman. She said if like if my apartment's [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2689.0s)]
*  clean my work's not doing well. It's like for me [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2693.0s)]
*  it really is one or the other. If my place is clean I haven't had a set in a couple days. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2697.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like I've been at home. If I'm doing well [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2701.0s)]
*  my shit is. I have boxes in my house that are just half opened. I got [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2705.0s)]
*  bags of stuff. I'm like I don't know what that is. I have them packed from the last trip before the [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2709.0s)]
*  next trip. That's really interesting. It's really interesting [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2713.0s)]
*  that she said that. I think creative people would probably agree with that. Like especially [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2717.0s)]
*  when you get on a like if you're on something like you're working on [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2721.0s)]
*  something you're like really into it. I don't give a fuck what's going on around me. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2725.0s)]
*  I'm just focused on what I'm doing. I got empty cans and shit. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2729.0s)]
*  We just wrote a movie together and that whole time my apartment was [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2733.0s)]
*  fucked up. Same. Same. It was embarrassing. It was embarrassing. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2737.0s)]
*  I gotta tell you being a creative is [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2741.0s)]
*  embarrassing. Being a creative? It's embarrassing. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2745.0s)]
*  It is. We were meeting at like coffee shops in between [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2749.0s)]
*  our house to write and I'm like a loud writer. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2753.0s)]
*  I'm like I don't want anyone to know what I'm doing. I would rather people not know I'm writing [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2757.0s)]
*  a script. And Sarah's like what if we say throbbing instead of pulsating? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2761.0s)]
*  I'm like exterior day. Did you write that? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2765.0s)]

*  doesn't give a fuck. I don't get embarrassed. I think you cooked that part of your brain off [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2773.0s)]
*  with that or all. Hell yeah. That embarrassment [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2777.0s)]
*  machine is just fucking. I'm like [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2781.0s)]
*  I don't get humiliated like that. It got redlined too long. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2785.0s)]
*  Go! Well it's also a me thing because if [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2789.0s)]
*  I hear people writing a script out loud I'm like okay. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2793.0s)]
*  That's the thing. So I know people are doing that. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2797.0s)]
*  That's what I mean. And people don't realize that I'm not. So they don't know [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2801.0s)]
*  and they think I am even though I shouldn't care. I'm like I don't give a fuck what these people think. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2805.0s)]
*  Alright exterior day. We're in the attic. Did you write that? I'm like shhh. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2809.0s)]
*  I talked to this guy Mark Greeny. He's the guy who wrote that book The Grey Man. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2813.0s)]
*  They did that. Ryan Reynolds. It's Ryan Reynolds right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2817.0s)]
*  He's the one who played it. It was a Netflix movie. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2821.0s)]
*  It's a really good book series. He writes in coffee shops. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2825.0s)]
*  Did I? Green Man is Ryan Gosling. God damn it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2829.0s)]
*  I always fuck those dudes up. They're both great. I don't. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2833.0s)]
*  No disrespect. Ryan Gosling. They're both great. He's really good in The Grey Man. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2837.0s)]
*  This guy writes in coffee shops. I was like well why? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2841.0s)]
*  You got a house. Why don't you write at your house? Some people like writing in public [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2845.0s)]
*  around people. They want to feel people's weirdness and energy. It's fun to [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2849.0s)]
*  watch. People watch too. It gives your brain a break. If you want to test your friendship [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2853.0s)]
*  write a script with your best friend. Oh yeah. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2857.0s)]
*  Do anything with your best friend. I've written stuff with people. It can get [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2861.0s)]
*  taxing. It can. It can. But then we went to Hawaii [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2865.0s)]
*  and we healed. We say that Hawaii healed our marriage. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2869.0s)]
*  It did. It healed us. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2873.0s)]
*  We were in Kauai and boy did we have a time. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2877.0s)]
*  You guys are such a good complement of each other though. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2881.0s)]
*  When you guys are doing your podcast. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2885.0s)]
*  If you ever see a show where they just take two people and they put them together and they force them to be friends. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2889.0s)]
*  That's called Kill Tony. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2893.0s)]
*  That's how we met. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2897.0s)]
*  You are spot on with that. That is [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2901.0s)]
*  exactly what happened. We were both the regulars. We had to do a minute together and then eventually [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2905.0s)]
*  we were like we should write this together every week. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2909.0s)]
*  You guys are just a good hang. Thank you. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2913.0s)]
*  That comes across when you do your podcast. You're just talking shit. We get into adventures. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2917.0s)]
*  We're actual friends. There are so many people that ride their bike [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2921.0s)]
*  on the highway out here. It's wild. I hate those people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2925.0s)]
*  I'm like what are you doing? I was watching this couple and they were riding their bike. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2929.0s)]
*  Everyone's going by them literally two feet away. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2933.0s)]
*  Going 60 miles an hour and they're on the side [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2937.0s)]
*  pedaling their bicycle. Anything can go wrong. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2941.0s)]
*  Anybody can bump someone. Anybody can get a blow out. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2945.0s)]
*  All that shit is happening. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2949.0s)]
*  I'm out here being healthy. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2953.0s)]
*  I'm out here looking to lengthen my life. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2957.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you doing? Bitch go to a park. I just saw a cyclist on Thanksgiving. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2961.0s)]
*  I saw one on Thanksgiving and he's like I'm biking to my mom's house [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2965.0s)]
*  25 miles away. I was like up a mountain. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2969.0s)]
*  It was going to take seven hours and he was going to get there for Thanksgiving dinner. I'm like just go eat dinner with your family dude. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2973.0s)]
*  Just go eat. Just buy a Peloton. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2977.0s)]
*  I guess it's an adventure that way. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2981.0s)]
*  It hurts the whole time. You see those dudes that walk all the way across the country? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2985.0s)]
*  There's these crazy trails that they do. What is it? The Appalachian Trail? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2989.0s)]
*  I think Ari Maness used to do stuff like that. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2993.0s)]
*  It takes days and days and days and days of walking. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=2997.0s)]
*  They have these little places where they can camp out on the way because other people do the hike too. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3001.0s)]
*  You're always running into serial killers. You ever walk for an hour? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3005.0s)]
*  How many serial killers are out there in that woods hiking that trail? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3009.0s)]
*  That's probably the way to serial kill. If you want to find a serial killer, go to the woods. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3013.0s)]
*  Go to a trail in the woods. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3017.0s)]
*  What are you hiking out here for? [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3021.0s)]
*  I do love hiking. Me too. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3025.0s)]
*  It's hard as a woman but it's fun. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3029.0s)]
*  I love being outside. You're in the woods already. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3033.0s)]
*  You're bringing yourself into the woods. You don't even have to drag you in there. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3037.0s)]
*  The last time I went hiking I went on a different hike than I normally do with less people because I like it more. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3041.0s)]
*  It's never anyone around and it makes me a little nervous. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3045.0s)]
*  I went on a different hike and he was just there the whole time. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3049.0s)]
*  When I got to the top it was a door guy from the comedy store. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3053.0s)]
*  He was like, oh hey Kim. I was like, hey Renee. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3057.0s)]
*  I know it was Renee. That's so funny. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3061.0s)]
*  I was like thank God. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3065.0s)]
*  There's something about working outside that I really love. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3069.0s)]
*  It feels very calming and meditative. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3073.0s)]
*  I love the sun. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3077.0s)]
*  It was so nice. It was our first real vacation in so long when we went to Hawaii. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3081.0s)]
*  If I'm at the beach I'm pretty embarrassed. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3085.0s)]
*  Dude, we're supposed to get sun all the time. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3089.0s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why you feel good when you're on vacation. You're getting all that vitamin G. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3093.0s)]
*  Tell Joe how I was in the ocean. Sarah's tanning. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3097.0s)]
*  I snorkel on. I have a tube where the water is breaking and I'm trying to dive through the tube. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3101.0s)]
*  I'm riding the tube onto the sand and flipping. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3105.0s)]
*  I'm like reading a magazine on the sand. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3109.0s)]
*  I don't leave the water until my lips are blue and my hands are wrinkled. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3113.0s)]
*  I'll just float with a snorkel like I'm dead. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3117.0s)]
*  Let the waves wash me in and drag me out and wash me in. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3121.0s)]
*  For hours. It never gets old to me. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3125.0s)]
*  You gotta tell him about the turtles. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3129.0s)]
*  I got humiliated in Kauai. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3133.0s)]
*  She gets embarrassed. I didn't give a fuck. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3137.0s)]
*  We went to this beach where the sea turtles swim up. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3141.0s)]
*  I'm very aware of not touching anything, staying away, giving everything its space. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3145.0s)]
*  I'm trying to do that but the tourists are chasing the turtle to where it runs into me. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3149.0s)]
*  It's trying to escape and I'm trying not to move so it can't go around me but it doesn't know where to go. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3153.0s)]
*  Right then this lady comes with a megaphone and she's like, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3157.0s)]
*  Step away from the turtle. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3161.0s)]
*  I am mortified. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3165.0s)]
*  I hope nobody listens to the pod. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3169.0s)]
*  I'm getting in front of a bunch of people getting yelled at. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3173.0s)]
*  She's in flippers. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3177.0s)]
*  I'm embarrassed while everybody watches you leave. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3181.0s)]
*  I couldn't let it go for four hours. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3185.0s)]
*  She's like, Where's the fuck? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3189.0s)]
*  She's like, Taking pictures of the turtles. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3193.0s)]
*  She said I was stressing them out. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3197.0s)]
*  She was like a turtle beach Karen. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3201.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3205.0s)]
*  How dare you. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3209.0s)]
*  They give people lion's mane mushrooms. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3213.0s)]
*  I didn't have another mushroom. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3217.0s)]
*  Sea carons are a special breed. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3221.0s)]
*  I was watching a sea caron once in Malibu. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3225.0s)]
*  In Malibu these guys were on the beach and they were fishing. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3229.0s)]
*  They caught a stingray. As they're pulling the stingray in, this lady comes out of her back porch and runs down the beach yelling, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3233.0s)]
*  Put it back. Put it back in the water. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3239.0s)]
*  You can eat a stingray if you so choose to. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3243.0s)]
*  You could? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3247.0s)]
*  I've had it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3251.0s)]
*  I had it on a menu at a restaurant. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3255.0s)]
*  It's like a fish. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3259.0s)]
*  It's interesting. It's an interesting flavor. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3263.0s)]
*  If you're fishing for food and a stingray comes in, I'm pretty sure you're allowed to eat them. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3267.0s)]
*  Google and find out if that's true. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3271.0s)]
*  There are lots of sea carons. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3275.0s)]
*  She came out and she was demanding they comply. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3279.0s)]
*  That's all public land. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3283.0s)]
*  That's what's so wild about having a house in Malibu. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3287.0s)]
*  Is it legal to catch stingrays? Allowed statewide, mostly taken in Southern California. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3291.0s)]
*  It's totally legal. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3295.0s)]
*  That's what it means. Eat them. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3299.0s)]
*  Imagine catching and releasing stingrays. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3303.0s)]
*  Do you remember the movie The Perfect Storm? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3307.0s)]
*  They're cute. Sometimes you look at them and they're smiling. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3311.0s)]
*  They do look like people. Like aliens got stuck inside of a fish. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3315.0s)]
*  They do seem alien. Like sandwich jellyfish. Alien as hell. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3319.0s)]
*  The stuff in the sea, very alien. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3323.0s)]
*  They did some study recently where they showed that jellyfish, despite not having a brain, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3327.0s)]
*  they seemed to be able to learn. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3331.0s)]
*  Now they're trying to figure out how they learn it. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3335.0s)]
*  They feel the vibes. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3339.0s)]
*  You don't have to have a brain to feel the vibes. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3343.0s)]
*  If we live in a vibrational universe where everything is frequency, it would make sense. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3347.0s)]
*  They just go with what the flow is. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3351.0s)]
*  They just go with whatever the energy is doing already. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3355.0s)]
*  You came up with this theory together and you discussed this. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3359.0s)]
*  I just thought of it right now and Sarah came on board with me. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3363.0s)]
*  I think we live in a vibrational universe. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3367.0s)]
*  Things enter our experience based on the things that we think and the world that we create. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3371.0s)]
*  I just think if the fish are flowing this way, the jelly is going to go this way too. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3375.0s)]
*  It seems like they know what they're doing. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3379.0s)]
*  They're just going with whatever is happening around them. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3383.0s)]
*  Some of them are poisonous as fuck. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3387.0s)]
*  Like the box jellyfish. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3391.0s)]
*  Which means they're aware that there's danger. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3395.0s)]
*  They're sentient in some way. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3399.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people like that. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3403.0s)]
*  Especially if you think about where box jellyfish live. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3407.0s)]
*  Australia has those little cute octopi that [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3411.0s)]
*  are the little blue ringed ones [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3415.0s)]
*  that look like you can pick them up but they'll kill you. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3419.0s)]
*  They're the most dangerous one in the world. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3423.0s)]
*  The blue ringed octopus. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3427.0s)]
*  They have videos of that one. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3431.0s)]
*  It's one of the most deadly octopus. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3435.0s)]
*  It looks sick. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3439.0s)]
*  I want that in a jacket. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3443.0s)]
*  It bites. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3447.0s)]
*  It's nicknamed bro. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3451.0s)]
*  It only attacks humans when it feels in danger. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3455.0s)]
*  If you're trying to corner a blue ringed octopus it might become aggressive. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3459.0s)]
*  It has two types of toxins. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3463.0s)]
*  It's a toxic toxin for self defense. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3467.0s)]
*  A blue ringed octopus ejects tetrodoxin. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3471.0s)]
*  A harmful toxin that could paralyze and kill a human adult in mere minutes. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3475.0s)]
*  It's 1200 times more toxic than cyanide. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3479.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3483.0s)]
*  Holy shit. There's no known antidote. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3487.0s)]
*  It's the same kind of toxin that pufferfish have. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3491.0s)]
*  It can kill 26 full adults in one bite. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3495.0s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3499.0s)]
*  That is so insane. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3503.0s)]
*  There's videos of people that pick it up that go viral because they don't know better. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3507.0s)]
*  They're playing with it in the ocean. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3511.0s)]
*  They had a Netflix thing about how [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3515.0s)]
*  octopi are really smart and they have the average brain [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3519.0s)]
*  of a five year old child. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3523.0s)]

*  They have this tank [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3539.0s)]
*  that was set up next to another tank. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3543.0s)]
*  One tank had octopus in it and the other tank had fish in it. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3547.0s)]
*  They set up a camera and what was going on was the octopus was climbing out [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3551.0s)]
*  of his tank, walking across the floor, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3555.0s)]
*  climbing up into the other tank, jacking a fish, eating it, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3559.0s)]
*  and then going back into his tank. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3563.0s)]
*  The comedian in me imagined it jacking off a fish and then eating it. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3567.0s)]
*  For some reason when I was imagining it the octopus was wearing sunglasses. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3571.0s)]
*  It's very scary. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3575.0s)]
*  I mean how insane [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3579.0s)]
*  is that? The thing figured out that it could get out and walk in a place where [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3583.0s)]
*  it can't breathe. Well they can fit through anything that their eyes can fit through. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3587.0s)]
*  That's crazy. No matter how big they are. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3591.0s)]
*  Don't quote me on that. How would it know [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3595.0s)]
*  that it could get out and climb? Joe, you want to hear the answer? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3599.0s)]
*  It's the vibes. It just knows. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3603.0s)]
*  The same way everyone knows [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3607.0s)]

*  plexiglass is going to go through that little hole. Oh yeah. And it could definitely [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3655.0s)]
*  fit because eyeballs are like a fist. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3659.0s)]
*  It did four other ones before I got to this video. So this is the one that might stuck? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3663.0s)]
*  Yeah I think it backs off. It realizes it's stuck? This is a fucking alien. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3667.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. They are aliens. How is that not an alien? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3671.0s)]

*  massive octopuses. They're smart enough to do it. What is that [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3715.0s)]
*  They found the fossilized version of the Kraken. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3719.0s)]
*  So they found these fossils of the suction cups on the bottom of the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3723.0s)]
*  ocean floor. And they were like what? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3727.0s)]
*  Like what is this? These are huge. Oh man. So if this is really [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3731.0s)]
*  an octopus like this. It's actually in Nevada. Oh is it really? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3735.0s)]
*  Wow. Oh that's crazy. They're like imprints of [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3739.0s)]
*  tentacles. They always want you to unlock the story of these people. I think there's more [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3743.0s)]
*  than one of these things that they found now. Wow. Cause this image [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3747.0s)]
*  looks different. Giant Kraken layer [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3751.0s)]
*  discovered. Wow. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3755.0s)]
*  Okay State Park in Nevada. What is it? Berlin, Indos [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3759.0s)]
*  Squid eating sperm whales. Indos Thor. Iquitosor. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3763.0s)]
*  State Park. Whatever it is. Where McMinnon and his daughter spent a few days [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3767.0s)]
*  in the summer. The site where the remains of nine 45 [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3771.0s)]
*  foot Ithios Ichyothorus of the species. Oh my [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3775.0s)]
*  god with these words. These words are. Shoniosaurus popularis can be [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3779.0s)]
*  found. These were the Triassic counterparts of today's predatory giant squid [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3783.0s)]
*  eating sperm whales. But the fossils at [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3787.0s)]
*  the Nevada site have a long history of perplexing researchers including the world's expert [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3791.0s)]
*  on the site. The late Charles Lewis Camp of UC Berkeley. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3795.0s)]
*  Charles Camp puzzled over these fossils in the 1950s. In his papers [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3799.0s)]
*  he kept referring to how peculiar the site was. We agree it's peculiar. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3803.0s)]
*  So where is the thing about the Kraken thing? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3807.0s)]
*  Yeah when does Kraken eat people? That's what I want to hear. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3811.0s)]
*  That's what this is I believe. I think that's a Kraken. Snaggle tooth. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3815.0s)]
*  Oh what is that? It's kind of a mean name. No that's a fish. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3819.0s)]
*  Yeah. That looks like a dolphin. I mean I think he's talking about other things that he did [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3823.0s)]
*  as well. Before whales. See. Kraken. Yeah. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3827.0s)]
*  So this Kraken thing. So whatever those tentacles are they see there. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3831.0s)]
*  It fed on those. It fed on those. So it ate those giant fish. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3835.0s)]
*  Holy crap. A Kraken of such mythological proportions it could have sent Captain Nemo [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3839.0s)]
*  running for dry land. Wow. So this guy. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3843.0s)]
*  So scroll down and let's find out how big this fucking these tentacles [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3847.0s)]
*  were. Does it say anything in there? I didn't see anything about that. No. I was going to try to find [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3851.0s)]
*  another website. Because they're trying to figure out how big this octopus must have been. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3855.0s)]
*  But the question is like what part of the tentacle is it? Is it the end of it? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3859.0s)]
*  Or it's smaller? Is it the part where it's thickest? Like what part [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3863.0s)]
*  do they have a real fossil of? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3867.0s)]
*  Whoa. I want to know how big it was. Imagine getting [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3871.0s)]
*  suctioned to death by a Kraken. No thanks. It just makes sense because [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3875.0s)]
*  everything was giant back then. They had megalodons. The sharks were fucking huge. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3879.0s)]
*  Megalodons are crazy. If you've ever seen a megalodon tooth online [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3883.0s)]
*  it's nuts. Gnarly. Gnarly. Yeah. I have one. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3887.0s)]
*  You do? Yeah my daughter does. She's got this megalodon tooth that's like that big. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3891.0s)]
*  That's so cool. It's fossilized. There's a bunch of them. You can buy them [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3895.0s)]
*  online. But they were fucking giant. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3899.0s)]
*  And they were just eating everything. Are they gone? Well not. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3903.0s)]
*  If you watched it Jason say the movie. The Meg. They're gone [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3907.0s)]
*  for sure though. The Meg is called? You ever see the Meg? How do we know there's not one roaming around? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3911.0s)]
*  If you dumb yourself up to a considerable extent with the right substances [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3915.0s)]
*  the Meg is an absolutely hilarious movie. I could enjoy the megalodon [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3919.0s)]
*  movie or whatever. That's what it is. The Meg. Yeah. I saw the previews. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3923.0s)]
*  I can dumb myself down for it because immediately I was like I want to see that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3927.0s)]
*  It's like living in the 80's. Yeah. Wait. Sharknado energy. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3931.0s)]
*  So I saw you and Brian Simpson were smelling salt and I wanted [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3935.0s)]
*  to do it. Oh yeah. You said you had some freshies. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3939.0s)]
*  We're here for the salt challenge Joe. We gotta do the freshies. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3943.0s)]
*  Salt salt salt salt. People have been sniffing salt [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3947.0s)]
*  at the studio. It's become a thing for some reason. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3951.0s)]
*  I don't know who brought them to the studio. They brought a bunch of them. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3955.0s)]
*  Well to the studio first and then people brought it to the green room. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3959.0s)]
*  I don't know who brought the stuff to the green room but there's a bunch of stuff in there. Bunch of different kinds. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3963.0s)]
*  Bunch of different kinds. And I feel like I have them at home now. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3967.0s)]
*  I'm like am I doing something illegal? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3971.0s)]
*  They have not prepared you for what you're going to experience today. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3975.0s)]
*  This is the real thing. Now I'm scared. This is the real one. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3979.0s)]
*  It's fear factor now. Listen to me. This is next level. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3983.0s)]
*  This is dark. Oh not dark. It's getting strange. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3987.0s)]
*  Strange. Strange you out. It's going to hit your [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3991.0s)]
*  nostrils. You're going to feel like your brain's on fire. You're going to wish you saw a Megalodon. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3995.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson took his headphones off and ran out of the room. If Brian Simpson [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=3999.0s)]
*  takes his headphones off it's an issue. Yeah his headphones [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4003.0s)]
*  stay on. The headphones don't leave his head. Okay now we're in trouble. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4007.0s)]
*  Oh no. Oh I don't like how it says ah. Yeah that's what [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4011.0s)]
*  it's called. The bag just says ah. Alright this is a freshie. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4015.0s)]

*  Andrea Gale the perfect storm boat. My dad was supposed to be on that boat. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4127.0s)]
*  Yeah and he used to work with the guy that was the captain of the ship and he said he didn't like [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4131.0s)]
*  that he would run into storms and not care about the crew. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4135.0s)]
*  And that's why he didn't go on the boat. Wow. Holy shit. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4139.0s)]
*  Wow I still taste the salt. Yeah. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4143.0s)]
*  Being in a storm on a boat must be the most terrifying shit. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4147.0s)]
*  You ever see those videos of cruise ships with the fucking pianos rolling behind. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4151.0s)]

*  more mobile. Like they might be able to survive it better. Like when [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4163.0s)]
*  I look at cruise ships I'm like that's a goddamn apartment building in [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4167.0s)]

*  It's fucking crazy. You have to really know what you're doing on a boat. The ocean [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4223.0s)]
*  is wild and the ocean will take you quick. Sarah and I almost [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4227.0s)]

*  little kids. Oh my god you know what's fucked up is that we were having the most [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4255.0s)]
*  perfect day. It was like the perfect beach day. We were surfing. We met [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4259.0s)]
*  hot Hawaiian locals. Hot guys. They were like teaching. They were taking us surfing. Pushing us into the waves. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4263.0s)]
*  We were having the best day. Smoke and joints. The waterfall was in the background and then that little [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4267.0s)]
*  boy drowned and it just like cleared the whole beach. Everybody was like [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4271.0s)]
*  we don't. It was so horrible and then at that point I realized that nobody knew [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4275.0s)]
*  CPR. I was the first one to yell does anybody know CPR? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4279.0s)]
*  Because this lady is just screaming help. She didn't know what to do. Oh my god. And then I'm like [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4283.0s)]
*  does anybody know CPR? And I look at the locals. What about the fucking lifeguards? The lifeguards weren't [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4287.0s)]
*  at that beach. And they were at a different beach. So [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4291.0s)]
*  nobody knew CPR and finally the lady just starts trying and she [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4295.0s)]
*  does it for like two minutes and then eventually you see this guy [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4299.0s)]
*  sprint. You knew it was his dad because it was like it's a different run than anybody [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4303.0s)]
*  else and he just like slides into the sand and just starts banging on his back. Like literally [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4307.0s)]
*  turns him over and just starts like. Because he was pretty much dead at that point. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4311.0s)]
*  And somehow that motion or that aggression or whatever he did [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4315.0s)]
*  brought him back. Like it like woke him up. Oh my god. And it's also [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4319.0s)]
*  like it's so scary. It was so fucking intense to watch. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4323.0s)]
*  And it was fucked up. For the rest of the trip I didn't go to any more [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4327.0s)]
*  tourist beach. I stayed on all the local beaches where all the locals only swam. Cause I [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4331.0s)]
*  kept having anxiety. I was watching other people's kids. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4335.0s)]
*  It fucked me up dude. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4339.0s)]
*  Things can change in a second. Watch your kids. If you're about to go on vacation watch your kids [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4343.0s)]
*  in the water. The ocean is a fucking [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4347.0s)]
*  beast. When Duncan was in Maui either like right before he got there or [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4351.0s)]
*  right after he got there someone got eaten by a shark. Someone got eaten by a shark when we were there. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4355.0s)]
*  In Kauai. In the same beach we were at where the boy drowned. The same beach. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4359.0s)]
*  In Kauai Bay someone got eaten by a shark. It was a local who surfed that [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4363.0s)]
*  same beach for like 25 years. But when we got there we [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4367.0s)]
*  realized they were telling us we were there during shark mating season. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4371.0s)]
*  So this was a surfer got taken out? Yeah a surfer. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4375.0s)]
*  But he was surfing in the reefs out deep into the ocean during mating season. Yeah they call it sharktober. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4379.0s)]
*  Sharktober is what they call it. During mating season. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4383.0s)]
*  And oh yeah and then you go to the local beaches and it's full of school kids. Like they [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4387.0s)]
*  beg. They're like how you would beg your parents to go to the mall. They are like please let us go [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4391.0s)]
*  catch a few waves after school. So it's all these school kids. That's where I surfed. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4395.0s)]
*  I went in with the local kids and they're all in the water and they're fucking [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4399.0s)]
*  out there. It's so funny like I'm out there like trying to catch a wave [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4403.0s)]
*  and they go party wave and you see them all going back. I'm like why are they going [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4407.0s)]
*  deeper into the ocean? I see this fucking huge wave coming at me and they're all [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4411.0s)]
*  catching it. Holding hands. Jumping on each other's boards. My mom says we have [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4415.0s)]
*  more and more wave then we have to go do homework. And they're shredding. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4419.0s)]
*  And they're shredding. But we watch like. They're surfing backwards on purpose. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4423.0s)]
*  Like they're having the most fun of their lives and they're out there during shark mating season. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4427.0s)]
*  They go hard in Hawaii. Those kids don't give a fuck. That is [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4431.0s)]
*  wild. They're awesome. During shark mating season. It was crazy. Yeah sharktober. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4435.0s)]
*  It was crazy. I was out there too. I caught some waves. How often does someone get [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4439.0s)]
*  taken? They said like I feel like every year they said they hear about [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4443.0s)]
*  a shark bite. Yeah. Or the drownings happen often I think. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4447.0s)]
*  Because a lot of tourists are there. Let's find out. How many [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4451.0s)]
*  people get bitten by sharks every year? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4455.0s)]
*  And we'll look at that first and then we'll go to just Hawaii. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4459.0s)]
*  Yeah. I know Florida. If you had to guess. Yeah it's gonna happen more and more. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4463.0s)]
*  I would say. How many people get bit every year? 40 a year in Hawaii. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4467.0s)]
*  30. 30. Really? In Hawaii? I don't think it's that many. I mean in the United States. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4471.0s)]
*  Oh in the whole country. Yeah. And I would say [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4475.0s)]
*  10 to 20 in Florida and the rest in Hawaii. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4479.0s)]
*  I think 20 a year. Yeah. I would say 40 [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4483.0s)]
*  total and 20 in the east coast and the west coast. I wanna say [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4487.0s)]
*  it's less than 10 a year in this country. I think [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4491.0s)]
*  since the water's gotten warmer they're coming in closer now. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4495.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean maybe. There's been more lately I think. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4499.0s)]
*  Also like we stopped eating shark fin soup and they got cocky. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4503.0s)]
*  Yeah we should go back. I heard it's really good for you. Shark fin soup. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4507.0s)]
*  Yeah that was part of the problem. One of the reasons why people started saying that [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4511.0s)]
*  you shouldn't kill sharks is because they were killing a lot of sharks [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4515.0s)]
*  and then just chopping their fins off to make shark fin soup. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4519.0s)]
*  It's a delicacy. I wonder if it's good. Not only is it a [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4523.0s)]
*  delicacy. My dad told me to correct this because I used to say on a podcast that shark fin [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4527.0s)]
*  cured my asthma but it wasn't shark fin it was shark liver oil. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4531.0s)]
*  So he wanted me to correct that one. It was very important to him. And he said that a lot of [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4535.0s)]
*  people use shark fin as a like um [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4539.0s)]
*  Afrodisiac? Dick lengthening? [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4543.0s)]
*  What's that medicine? That you take for. Viagra? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4547.0s)]
*  You get hard from the dick from shark fin? But here's the thing. They say that about everything that's endangered. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4551.0s)]
*  That they want people to take because men will take it. No but it's like rhino horn [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4555.0s)]
*  That's what they say but like fucking tiger paw. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4559.0s)]
*  I mean men will do anything to keep their dicks hard. They'll get rid of rhinos. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4563.0s)]
*  Before Viagra they were fucking terrified. They're like what is happening? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4567.0s)]
*  What do I got? I got nothing. I got nothing going on. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4571.0s)]
*  And so then they're like someone needs to get rhino horn. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4575.0s)]
*  They have a fucking ceremony. I heard the sin of a shark. They sit around the campfire [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4579.0s)]
*  and drink rhino horn. They're like which animal should we punish for this? [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4583.0s)]
*  I have a shark fact from Field and Stream. There's some interesting ones. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4587.0s)]
*  First of all, you're seven times more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten at all [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4591.0s)]
*  by a shark. Yeah that makes sense. Okay but that's not that many more times. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4595.0s)]
*  I also was trying to figure out how they've checked some of these numbers. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4599.0s)]
*  In 2022 there's 57 unprovoked shark attacks. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4603.0s)]
*  What is a provoked shark attack? Probably fishing for a shark. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4607.0s)]
*  You're trying to catch it and then it bites you. There's different numbers for that I checked. That was going to save that for the end. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4611.0s)]
*  Okay 70 unprovoked shark attacks annually leading to between [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4615.0s)]
*  five and six deaths per year. 2022 there were 57 such attacks [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4619.0s)]
*  a 10 year low. So while the risk is certainly there, it's relatively [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4623.0s)]
*  small. Here's a breakdown of how many shark attacks per year take place based on the [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4627.0s)]
*  latest information. So it gives countries first and then states. Before I showed you states [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4631.0s)]
*  I was going to let you guess because it's a little surprising. States? Yeah. The most attacks. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4635.0s)]
*  Okay. North Carolina. It's up there. It's in the top five. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4639.0s)]
*  California. It's in the top five I don't think. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4643.0s)]
*  It only showed seven. Florida. Florida is number one obviously. Yeah. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4647.0s)]
*  So what would be number two? California. South Carolina. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4651.0s)]
*  New York really? New York's number two. New York's a wild guess. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4655.0s)]
*  So it shows New York number two at eight. Hawaii dude. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4659.0s)]
*  California. Hawaii five by five. Florida [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4663.0s)]
*  16. Florida 16. I wasn't even thinking Alabama. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4667.0s)]
*  We're from Florida's information from UF Florida [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4671.0s)]
*  University. Texas is crazy. But how can you get bit by a shark in [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4675.0s)]
*  Texas? If you get bit by a shark in Texas you're just unlucky. I don't know [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4679.0s)]
*  what to say. You're an idiot. They have sharks out there. The beach is done. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4683.0s)]
*  In a tiny part of Texas. Really? Yeah but they have like boat bites. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4687.0s)]
*  There's four boat bites. That they bite boats? Like that one that we played? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4691.0s)]
*  Unprovoked Bites is also divers Joe. People that go into [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4695.0s)]
*  their environment and then get attacked. Not people that are just swimming on the beach. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4699.0s)]
*  Right. Which makes sense. Also I don't know. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4703.0s)]
*  While unhooking or removing. Yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4707.0s)]
*  Bites on spear fishers. Bites on people attempting to feed sharks. Like that guy [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4711.0s)]
*  who lost his pinky. Do you think he reported that? Yeah good call. Right. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4715.0s)]
*  Right. Have you spear fished Joe? No I have not. It's supposed [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4719.0s)]
*  to be really fun. It's awesome. It looks awesome. I really want to do it. Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4723.0s)]
*  It looks really fun. It's like archery underwater. Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4727.0s)]
*  That's what most of my friends have done. Everyone says it's so fun. I have a lot of friends that [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4731.0s)]
*  spear fish in Florida. Yeah. Yeah I mean Florida [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4735.0s)]
*  is an awesome place to do it right? There's these videos of this girl [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4739.0s)]
*  on TikTok and she swims in her grandparents Everglades. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4743.0s)]
*  What? And she like oh and there's another dude and he like literally goes into the Everglades [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4747.0s)]
*  barefoot at night and like waddles in the water and picks up snakes and bugs and frogs [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4751.0s)]
*  and his whole TikTok. He's like an 18 year old kid [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4755.0s)]
*  and he's like picking up baby sharks and he's like oh uh uh look over there and then it'll be like [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4759.0s)]

*  like he's nuts. He's nuts. It's a whole TikTok. It's like Steve Irwin [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4767.0s)]
*  energy. It's Steve Irwin if Steve Irwin was making the worst [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4771.0s)]
*  choices of his life. He's picking up poisonous snakes. So eventually he's [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4775.0s)]
*  gonna get it. Yeah. He's gonna get it. Dude I almost got eaten by an alligator when I was 8 [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4779.0s)]
*  years old camping with my friend. Her, my best friend's mom dared us to [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4783.0s)]
*  jump into the water at night into the Everglades. We were in the Springs [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4787.0s)]
*  of Florida. It's a crazy thing to dare your children to do. Yeah she was on [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4791.0s)]
*  she was on Mommy Wine on vacation and was like I dare you guys to jump into the [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4795.0s)]
*  Springs cause the thing is when you're, anybody who's from Florida knows if you're at the [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4799.0s)]
*  Springs like you can canoe through the part that's like the Everglades [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4803.0s)]
*  and there's sharks and stuff and then you go off in their side springs that are clear and you can see [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4807.0s)]
*  through them and you can swim there but you should know that maybe a gator [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4811.0s)]
*  could show up but you can see. Right. So that's where we'd swim and stuff and so the [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4815.0s)]
*  giant swimming hole you could see through but at night she just had us fucking in there. Is this the Everglades [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4819.0s)]
*  kid I think? I mean this is a videographer who's making really cool videos in Everglades. No that's [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4823.0s)]

*  Yeah. I was trying to find it. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4867.0s)]
*  He has that video on his side of those two bears going after it. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4871.0s)]
*  That's one of the wildest videos ever. Watch these two bears just [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4875.0s)]
*  fighting over mating rights. No. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4879.0s)]

*  shoulders. Bears fight crazy. He's got his own footage from there. Oh he's got his own footage from [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4891.0s)]
*  Alaska as well. Wow. Oh wow. Wow look at that bear. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4895.0s)]
*  This kid should work for National Geographic. Maybe he might. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4899.0s)]
*  Maybe just keep doing this for himself. Yeah. Don't let anybody tell you [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4903.0s)]
*  what to do. You're doing it perfect. He is actually. Yeah. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4907.0s)]
*  You're right Joe. That's a good lesson. That's a [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4911.0s)]
*  wild place. You ever been to Alaska? No I've never been. Oh my god it's so amazing. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4915.0s)]
*  I've heard it's amazing. It's crazy. And the people there are different. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4919.0s)]
*  Is that where the Northern Lights are? They definitely have them up there. Some places. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4923.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah some parts of the. I think the best place to see them isn't it in like [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4927.0s)]
*  Norway or some shit? Yeah like Iceland and shit like that. Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4931.0s)]
*  That's the best place. Yeah that makes sense. It's supposed to be amazing. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4935.0s)]
*  I want to go. It sounds a little cold. I usually if I have a choice to go somewhere [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4939.0s)]
*  it's usually a warm water area. Yeah. I'm a water girl. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4943.0s)]
*  It's a tough sell to go and suffer on a vacation. Yeah just for a beautiful view. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4947.0s)]
*  Fairbanks Alaska. I mean I have to see that once. Fuck man. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4951.0s)]
*  It's one of the best places in the world to see them. Oh Fairbanks beautiful. Wow. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4955.0s)]
*  Are they selling it? Is this Fairbanks Times? No no. Fairbanks.com. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4959.0s)]
*  Oh my god look at that. That looks awesome. Fuck. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4963.0s)]
*  Fairbanks Alaska it is. Norway. Catch me there. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4967.0s)]
*  We should do a JRE trip. Oh my god. Yes look at the Northern Lights. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4971.0s)]
*  I'll go up there with a fucking giant crew of people. That would be so fun. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4975.0s)]
*  A bunch of mushrooms in Norway. That's the Iceland place. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4979.0s)]
*  How do you say that word? Reykjavik. A bunch of lions man. Iceland. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4983.0s)]
*  Look at that. Wow. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4987.0s)]
*  And that's like not even [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4991.0s)]
*  a bullshit CGI filter. I mean if I saw that and I didn't know what it was I'd be like the aliens. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4995.0s)]
*  My dad is claiming he's seeing aliens every night [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=4999.0s)]
*  and he's a fisherman so he lives in the water. But he's claiming he sees [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5003.0s)]
*  aliens and he's letting other people know and there's Facebook groups about it and he can see them [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5007.0s)]
*  at night and they have a ship and it's doing a repetitive thing in the sky. And [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5011.0s)]
*  all these people are trying to take pictures of it and they can't and he's got this whole thing about it. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5015.0s)]
*  He's been calling me consistently. Jeff loves to talk aliens. Yeah he is like [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5019.0s)]
*  cause he lives in the ocean pretty much at night so he's like you don't, he's like I've seen [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5023.0s)]
*  crazy shit. I believe him. Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5027.0s)]
*  He says that there's like a ship, it looks like a ship in the sky almost and he says [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5031.0s)]
*  I don't even remember. When he explains it to me it sounds like a dad trying [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5035.0s)]
*  to explain it. He's like the carburetor, it's like on a [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5039.0s)]
*  he's like saying things like that. And I'm like okay. And he keeps saying that there's like a [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5043.0s)]
*  repetitive process. Like he could see the ships ran by in energy [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5047.0s)]
*  and then it builds and builds and then it almost explodes and then it gets [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5051.0s)]
*  ran by the same energy again. He's like I'm watching it, how it's running and staying going. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5055.0s)]
*  Did you film this? He said he tried to film it and it doesn't come out on his phone very well. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5059.0s)]
*  And he's like I keep posting what I filmed online and people are calling me crazy cause they can't really [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5063.0s)]
*  see what I'm saying. He uses a Samsung phone so he can zoom in on that motherfucker. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5067.0s)]
*  I don't think he even has the latest iPhone, he doesn't even have a phone with a good camera. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5071.0s)]
*  He's like an old fisherman. Right. That's probably part of [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5075.0s)]
*  it too. If you keep seeing it though you should get him a camera. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5079.0s)]
*  Get him like a really good camera with a zoom lens. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5083.0s)]
*  Like something, something where you could [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5087.0s)]
*  like a little handy cam. He said at one point he got so nervous he [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5091.0s)]
*  kind of felt thankful he couldn't get a video. He was like I don't even know if I want to have [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5095.0s)]
*  the video. Like it makes me nervous to put it out. He's like he's [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5099.0s)]
*  fully convinced it's alien ships in the sky and he's like I know I sound crazy. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5103.0s)]
*  Yeah but it doesn't sound that crazy. It doesn't. See I [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5107.0s)]
*  go back and forth on aliens, Jamie does too. We were just talking about it the other day. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5111.0s)]
*  Jamie was like one day I'm in and then two days later I'm like nope I'm out. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5115.0s)]
*  Fuck this. I'm always in. I'm always in. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5119.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. I think there's a high [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5123.0s)]
*  possibility that the United States government has developed some sort of a [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5127.0s)]
*  drone that operates on a propulsion system that is not understood [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5131.0s)]
*  by the general public. I think it's some sort of a gravity [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5135.0s)]
*  defying propulsion system which is something they theorized [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5139.0s)]
*  and they've been working on for a long fucking time. This is something that they theorized [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5143.0s)]
*  a long time ago. If I was the government and I had the [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5147.0s)]
*  ability to run secret programs. What kind of system? It would have to be [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5151.0s)]
*  something that instead of using a propulsion system like an internal [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5155.0s)]
*  combustion engine which is like what rockets are and what gasoline powered [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5159.0s)]
*  cars are. Essentially with rockets you know you're shooting something out the back that makes [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5163.0s)]
*  you go this way. What these things are doing is changing [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5167.0s)]
*  gravity around them. That's what he said he's seeing. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5171.0s)]
*  He said it looks like it's using the energy from the gravity as a vacuum [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5175.0s)]
*  and then spitting it back out. What these things supposedly can do [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5179.0s)]
*  is the way it's described by Bob Lazar who is [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5183.0s)]
*  this gentleman who claimed to work at Area 51 [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5187.0s)]
*  Area S4. If you had like a soft mattress and you put a bowling ball [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5191.0s)]
*  in the mattress it would pull everything towards the [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5195.0s)]
*  bowling ball. What these things are doing is finding a point in [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5199.0s)]
*  space and pulling space and time together [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5203.0s)]
*  and cross it. So they're moving at [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5207.0s)]
*  insane rates of speed. So the question is if they [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5211.0s)]
*  have these things in the sky and they've had them for a long time. If they've had them since [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5215.0s)]
*  the TikTok video which was Commander David Fravor in [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5219.0s)]
*  2004 off the coast of San Diego. They viewed this thing [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5223.0s)]
*  they had multiple jets that were viewing it plus there was [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5227.0s)]
*  two other sources of data including video. So they had radar on this [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5231.0s)]
*  thing that made it go from they showed it went from 50,000 feet [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5235.0s)]
*  above sea level above 50,000 feet to about 50 [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5239.0s)]
*  in a second or less than a second. As quick as it took to register this [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5243.0s)]
*  thing had appeared and then they go to where this thing is [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5247.0s)]
*  they see it hovering over something that looks like a ship that's underwater. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5251.0s)]
*  The thing turns towards them. They have this thing on video [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5255.0s)]
*  and then takes off at a rate of speed that if there [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5259.0s)]
*  was people inside of it they would become jelly. The gravity would [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5263.0s)]
*  literally turn you into pink mist. Right like it can't be human. And this thing just [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5267.0s)]
*  shh. Pink mist? That was visceral. This thing just disappears. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5271.0s)]
*  Tim Burchett tells Tucker Carlson he's talking to Speaker Johnson [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5275.0s)]
*  about UFO Disclosure Act. Says all I want is transparency. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5279.0s)]

*  keep everything we need in one place. Which is why [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5531.0s)]
*  I'm saying we need to spread the chickens. But the reason why it's all in one place is because of corporations. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5535.0s)]
*  Yeah man. Capitalism sweetie. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5539.0s)]

*  Because that one they literally faked an attack to get us to go to Vietnam. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5829.0s)]
*  I hate to be on mushrooms about it but why when we don't have to? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5833.0s)]
*  We could all just be happy. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5837.0s)]
*  Well the problem is it seems like the default behavior of human beings [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5841.0s)]
*  when they get control over giant groups of human beings is to control them tightly. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5845.0s)]
*  Every time. And then also try to invade. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5849.0s)]
*  Try to steal other people's resources. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5853.0s)]
*  It's so barbaric. It's very Roman Empire of us. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5857.0s)]
*  And just not. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5861.0s)]
*  I think it's possible to have not. But I think it's going to require the next stage of whatever human beings are currently doing right now. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5865.0s)]
*  People scoff at the thought of world peace. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5869.0s)]
*  No we need an evolution. Like a spiritual awakening. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5873.0s)]
*  We need a restart. We need the solar. We need tomorrow. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5877.0s)]
*  It seems very early man to just be blowing each other up. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5881.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like it doesn't seem very evolved of us. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5885.0s)]
*  We shouldn't have iPhones and be blowing each other up. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5889.0s)]
*  It seems very low vibrational. It's not what a jellyfish would do. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5893.0s)]
*  I think human beings are all going to connect in the near future. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5897.0s)]
*  Within the next 50 years. We're going to connect through something that links that we carry around or have an implant. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5901.0s)]
*  It's the aliens. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5905.0s)]
*  And it locks us into each other. And if you could do that it would make war impossible. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5909.0s)]
*  It would be just like sharing thoughts with each other. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5913.0s)]
*  I would think it would change the way people feel about people. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5917.0s)]
*  You would know everything about everyone. There would be no more secrets. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5921.0s)]
*  Everything you're thinking. Whoever you are. What your essence is. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5925.0s)]
*  What your motivation really is. What your thoughts really are. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5929.0s)]
*  Everyone will see everything. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5933.0s)]
*  I've always said that people could look into my brain. Because I feel like I'm pretty straightforward. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5937.0s)]
*  Whatever I say is how I am. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5941.0s)]
*  You're not really a mixing up words type of person. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5945.0s)]
*  But it's very different than being able to understand how you think. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5949.0s)]
*  I would rather that people see in my head because I feel like I'm actually so straightforward that people think that there's more inside. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5953.0s)]
*  And it's actually meaner than it is. But I'm like oh no this is all of it. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5957.0s)]
*  I'm like oh no this is all of it. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5961.0s)]
*  I'm telling you the truth. I'm just not fluffing anything. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5965.0s)]
*  The way Kim texts when we first became friends. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5969.0s)]
*  Is she match or just be okay with a period. I'm like okay in a heart. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5973.0s)]
*  She's like wonderful morning. If the skies are blue then so are you. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5977.0s)]
*  Would you like a taco Mrs. Waffle? And I'm like egg taco. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5981.0s)]
*  She talks like a dude. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5985.0s)]
*  I would rather a phone call personally. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5989.0s)]
*  That's all Joey Diaz does. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5993.0s)]
*  I text him very rarely. I love you. Things like that. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=5997.0s)]
*  But he likes to call. I'm not going to lie. The first time I got a text from Joey I was shocked. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6001.0s)]
*  I was like I didn't even know he knew how to do that. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6005.0s)]
*  He gets mad at you. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6009.0s)]
*  That was back when you had to do it with your thumbs. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6013.0s)]
*  Remember those days? He's the only guy that calls me regularly [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6017.0s)]
*  just to check in. He's the best. Most of my people are friends. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6021.0s)]
*  I just see regularly. But out of the people I don't see. I call you to check in. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6025.0s)]
*  A little too much. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6029.0s)]
*  A phone rang the other day at my friend's house. They were like that's Sarah isn't it. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6033.0s)]
*  I was like yeah it's my old ball and chain. Hold on. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6037.0s)]
*  I'm like did you see the email? I also texted you about the email. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6041.0s)]
*  I'm like you know what? Send me something. Email it to me and then call me to read me both the text and the email. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6045.0s)]
*  I'm on it sweetie. I'm efficient. I notice all the emails. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6049.0s)]
*  This bitch should be like oh there's an email. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6053.0s)]
*  I thought this podcast was tomorrow. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6057.0s)]
*  No she actually did. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6061.0s)]
*  We're literally very yin and yang. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6065.0s)]
*  I am extremely ADD. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6069.0s)]
*  I don't understand why Gmail is the number one email thing. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6073.0s)]
*  When I click on the email it doesn't immediately go to the latest email. It goes to the top. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6077.0s)]
*  So that I have to scroll through every email. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6081.0s)]
*  It's the worst fucking. Are you talking about when you open a thread? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6085.0s)]
*  Yeah. It doesn't go to the latest email. Why? [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6089.0s)]
*  If you're the biggest email company why would that not be the thing? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6093.0s)]
*  Doesn't it? [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6097.0s)]
*  I don't know what the problem is here. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6101.0s)]
*  The way you're explaining it is above us. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6105.0s)]
*  I have to pee so bad that I can't listen to this right now. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6109.0s)]
*  You guys talk amongst yourselves. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6113.0s)]
*  We'll hold it down. We'll start our periods together. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6117.0s)]

*  This bitch. This bitch podcast. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6161.0s)]
*  Oh no did you almost drink that? Sometimes you want to promote a show and you accidentally try to drink your salts. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6165.0s)]
*  Did you try to sip a salt? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6169.0s)]
*  That one fucked me up. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6173.0s)]
*  It looks like meth. I'm not going to lie. The inside of it looks like something that's. It's giving breaking bad. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6177.0s)]
*  It looks like something that's been fossil. Very Walter White. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6181.0s)]
*  Jamie you want one? [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6185.0s)]
*  Come on Jamie. Have some fun with the girls. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6189.0s)]
*  I can't get in my other one because it's deviated. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6193.0s)]
*  That will undiviate your septum. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6197.0s)]
*  I fucked up. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6201.0s)]
*  She looks like she's doing a guest star in succession. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6205.0s)]
*  Look at her outfit. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6209.0s)]
*  I want daddy's business. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6213.0s)]
*  I want daddy's business. I'm the eldest son. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6217.0s)]
*  We took it too far. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6221.0s)]
*  Oh my god I'm crying. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6225.0s)]
*  You're not supposed to do two a day. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6229.0s)]
*  I think two a day is the maximum. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6233.0s)]
*  It suggests you don't do it more than twice in a day. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6237.0s)]
*  Your eyes are red. Look at your eyes. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6241.0s)]
*  Both of you look stoned. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6245.0s)]
*  We went through a lot while you were gone. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6249.0s)]
*  We were off the salt sweetie. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6253.0s)]
*  They're addicting. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6257.0s)]
*  This hits where a comet needs to get hit. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6261.0s)]

*  Oh shit man. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6273.0s)]
*  Doesn't it feel like you could rip a tree out of the ground? [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6277.0s)]
*  That's why they use it before they deadlift. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6281.0s)]

*  That's an insane name. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6297.0s)]
*  He's a super jacked powerlifter guy who does all these acrobatic things. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6301.0s)]
*  Amazing specimen. But this is his company. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6305.0s)]

*  This is Juju Mufu. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6345.0s)]
*  Full squats while he's pressing weight over his head. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6349.0s)]
*  That's a hundred kilos. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6353.0s)]

*  Juju Mufu? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6369.0s)]
*  You told us he owned the salt company. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6373.0s)]
*  But you didn't tell us he was going to be full split. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6377.0s)]
*  I did tell you he was an athletic freak. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6381.0s)]
*  But once you see it, it hits different. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6385.0s)]
*  He does a lot of wild shit. Show us some of the lifting stuff. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6389.0s)]
*  This is the kind of salt Juju Mufu can handle. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6393.0s)]
*  Juju Mufu, are you single? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6397.0s)]
*  This is the guy you would imagine would create a smelling salt that would knock your teeth out. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6401.0s)]
*  When I see him, I'm like maybe I should stop doing these salts. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6405.0s)]
*  Me too. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6409.0s)]
*  That's a manly man. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6413.0s)]
*  Imagine someone messing with this guy. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6417.0s)]
*  Imagine your ex-boyfriend comes up and says, I heard you're dating my girlfriend. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6421.0s)]
*  Who sized that fucker? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6425.0s)]
*  What did your husband do this morning? He moved a boulder from the bottom of the road to the top of the road. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6429.0s)]
*  He hit the salt and moved a boulder. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6433.0s)]
*  Juju Mufu, I'm a fan. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6437.0s)]
*  If he was my man, I'd have him in a man bun. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6441.0s)]
*  I like any guy. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6445.0s)]
*  Put your hair up, Mufu. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6449.0s)]
*  If I'm with a guy, he has to be able to kill another man or I'm not into it. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6453.0s)]
*  I'm not into it at all. If I think I could beat him up or he can't kill another man, I'm gone. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6457.0s)]
*  That's also a problem with you doing Jujitsu for a while. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6463.0s)]
*  Once you've been doing Jujitsu for a while, you kind of... [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6467.0s)]
*  It's hard to go back. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6471.0s)]
*  It's kind of like hanging out with comics. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6475.0s)]
*  It is true. I've been dating guys who do MMA and it hits different. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6479.0s)]
*  I haven't trained in Homo Seir. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6483.0s)]
*  It literally hits different. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6487.0s)]
*  I'm going back. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6491.0s)]
*  Not interested. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6495.0s)]
*  I have fake nails. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6499.0s)]
*  Custom mothership nails. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6503.0s)]
*  Custom mothership alien and UFO. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6507.0s)]
*  Do you guys believe in UFOs? [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6511.0s)]
*  Both my parents have crazy claims that they've experienced aliens. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6515.0s)]
*  I believe in UFOs. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6519.0s)]
*  Did you ever ask to go out with them? [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6523.0s)]
*  What if he keeps seeing these things? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6527.0s)]
*  How often does he see them? [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6531.0s)]
*  He saw them every night for three months. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6535.0s)]
*  Is this in Florida or Puerto Rico? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6539.0s)]
*  He saw them every night. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6543.0s)]
*  Other people started claiming they saw them. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6547.0s)]
*  If you were from another planet, wouldn't you do something at night? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6551.0s)]
*  No, you wouldn't be paying attention. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6555.0s)]
*  That's when I would do it. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6559.0s)]
*  Especially if you have bad phone service. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6563.0s)]
*  A lot of fishermen don't have the best cameras and phones. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6567.0s)]
*  What kind of satellite surveillance does the US government currently have? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6571.0s)]
*  What can they see? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6575.0s)]
*  They're in this room right now. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6579.0s)]
*  They can see everything that's happening. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6583.0s)]
*  When you're looking at the Earth as a whole, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6587.0s)]
*  can they see the whole ocean? [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6591.0s)]
*  What can they see? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6595.0s)]
*  Do they have to be able to pinpoint on a coordinate [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6599.0s)]
*  and then make the satellite turn towards that area? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6603.0s)]
*  How does it work? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6607.0s)]
*  If someone sights a UFO, can they see it? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6611.0s)]
*  What videos do they have? [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6615.0s)]
*  Five years ago, this was just what's public on YouTube. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6619.0s)]
*  This is going to zoom in on someone. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6623.0s)]
*  This is a spy satellite. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6627.0s)]
*  It'll zoom in on someone here at a bus stop. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6631.0s)]
*  Enhance. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6635.0s)]
*  What? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6639.0s)]
*  Oh my God, they're zooming in from the sky. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6643.0s)]
*  I think you can get closer to this too. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6647.0s)]
*  They can read the text? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6651.0s)]
*  They could read the text on the phone from the satellite in the sky. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6655.0s)]
*  That is fucking nice. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6659.0s)]
*  That just tripped me out. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6663.0s)]
*  If they can do this, and if you're a fisherman, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6667.0s)]
*  and you report the coordinates... [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6671.0s)]
*  That's insane that they can do that. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6675.0s)]
*  What do they see? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6679.0s)]
*  Do they have any video of these things? [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6683.0s)]
*  Imagine if they have high resolution photographs of these crafts. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6687.0s)]
*  When I think about what they have, I feel like they're so far ahead. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6691.0s)]
*  They know so much that we look like... [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6695.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen a kid trying to figure something out? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6699.0s)]
*  It's so cute that they think they're almost there. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6703.0s)]
*  They're playing house in the kitchen. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6707.0s)]
*  They're not even making a grilled cheese in a real kitchen. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6711.0s)]
*  They think they made a meal. That's what we look like to them. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6715.0s)]
*  Do we think there's aliens? They're probably the aliens watching us. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6719.0s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6723.0s)]
*  They're so far beyond anything we could even comprehend. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6727.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I get high and I'm on my laptop, I'm like, are they looking at me? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6731.0s)]
*  I'm not that interesting to watch. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6735.0s)]
*  Never talked about it again. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6739.0s)]
*  What about people who clone their dogs? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6743.0s)]
*  I love my dog. I'd like to clone him. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6747.0s)]
*  They want these conversations and not how advanced did they take that. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6751.0s)]
*  One day your dog is sitting at the foot of your bed staring at you. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6755.0s)]
*  It barks but its mouth doesn't move. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6759.0s)]
*  You got a new dog. It's a clone. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6763.0s)]
*  Her dog is a reincarnated man. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6767.0s)]
*  I swear to God he's a perverted teenage boy. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6771.0s)]
*  I was changing the other day in her room into a bathing suit. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6775.0s)]
*  It was just me and the dog. I could feel something staring and I looked and the dog went... [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6781.0s)]
*  It got caught staring at me and when I looked it turned away. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6785.0s)]
*  When I was in high school my friend Joe, Joe Spags, he had a dog that would aggressively hump his toys. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6789.0s)]
*  If you get anywhere near the toy the dog would growl at you. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6796.0s)]
*  He would bite his toy and just start hammering it in front of everybody. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6800.0s)]
*  We had a toy like that and the dog would hump the toys and the toys would be all crispy. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6808.0s)]
*  Then me and my sisters would threaten to throw it at each other. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6812.0s)]
*  The cum stuffy. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6816.0s)]
*  The cum infested crispy thing that our dog used to just... [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6820.0s)]
*  This dog was a little dog. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6824.0s)]
*  Our dog would stare us in the eye. They're the horniest ones. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6826.0s)]
*  One time I saw a chihuahua at the dog park that humped and came in the air. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6828.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6832.0s)]
*  The small dogs are the horniest. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6834.0s)]
*  He was just humping the air and cum was coming out of his body. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6836.0s)]
*  The owner was so embarrassed and we were all like... [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6840.0s)]
*  It was weird to witness. I never forgot it traumatized me. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6842.0s)]
*  The chihuahua who came in the air. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6846.0s)]
*  A chihuahua coming in the air? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6848.0s)]
*  I swear I'll never forget that little guy. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6850.0s)]
*  He said, Yoki, here at Taco Bell. He comes in the air. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6854.0s)]
*  When I was in college I had a dog with my boyfriend. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6856.0s)]
*  We were at the dog park and the dog pooped out a condom. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6860.0s)]
*  But it pooped out the condom with the poop inside the condom. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6862.0s)]
*  It was like a sack and everybody was like, what's happening to the dog? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6866.0s)]
*  Everyone surrounded it. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6869.0s)]
*  Then we all realized at the same time it was a condom and it got really weird. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6871.0s)]
*  He was just eating a condom. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6874.0s)]
*  So it was probably in the trash. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6876.0s)]
*  It was in the trash and he ate it. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6878.0s)]
*  Then the poop filled in the condom and then he pooped us. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6880.0s)]
*  That sounds fucking foul. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6882.0s)]
*  That's why I don't want to have pets. Who knows? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6884.0s)]
*  It's a lot, dude. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6886.0s)]
*  You're eating chizzen in the air. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6888.0s)]
*  Fucking your pillows. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6890.0s)]
*  This dog used to growl. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6892.0s)]
*  He used to growl while he was fucking it. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6894.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6896.0s)]
*  Our dog would look us in the eye while he was going at it. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6898.0s)]
*  Looked you in the eye while he was fucking his stuff down. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6900.0s)]
*  It's choking his stuffy. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6904.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6906.0s)]
*  Why is the dog doing 69 with his stuffy? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6908.0s)]
*  Why is he? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6912.0s)]
*  They're getting advanced these puppies. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6914.0s)]
*  Right, he's grabbing his stuffy's head, stuffing it up his ass. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6916.0s)]
*  Dude. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6918.0s)]
*  Woof. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6920.0s)]
*  Woof. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6922.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6924.0s)]
*  It's got a vibrator in its pussy and a stuffy in its ass. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6926.0s)]
*  You walk in the room, your dog's leg is in the air. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6928.0s)]
*  It's got claws down there. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6930.0s)]
*  Why is my dog's legs on its own shoulders? [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6932.0s)]
*  The stuffy's eating it out? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6934.0s)]
*  Imagine if you came into the room and your dog was lying on its back. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6936.0s)]
*  Legs in the air. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6938.0s)]
*  With a vibrator between their legs. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6940.0s)]
*  And then you came in and it's like woof. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6942.0s)]
*  And it pretends it's a dog again. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6944.0s)]
*  It is really weird. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6946.0s)]
*  My dog loves to lick his own dick. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6948.0s)]
*  Loves it. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6950.0s)]
*  Wouldn't you? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6954.0s)]
*  If I could eat my own pussy, you wouldn't see me again. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6956.0s)]
*  Bye. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6958.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if I would. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6960.0s)]
*  She'd have a curved back. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6962.0s)]
*  I'd be like, yeah, Marilyn Manson. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6964.0s)]
*  It makes sense that a dog would do it. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6966.0s)]
*  They don't know any better. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6968.0s)]
*  They don't even think there's anything wrong with doing it. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6970.0s)]
*  You gotta go, ew. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6972.0s)]
*  They're not even embarrassed after that either. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6974.0s)]
*  They're like, leave me alone. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6976.0s)]
*  They don't get embarrassed, which is fascinating. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6978.0s)]
*  That's why I love them. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6980.0s)]
*  Because they don't get embarrassed. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6982.0s)]
*  They do when they're in trouble. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6984.0s)]
*  They've done something wrong. They get sad. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6986.0s)]
*  Then you feel bad that you're yelling at them. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6988.0s)]
*  But you're like, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6990.0s)]
*  Hey, bro, you can't do that. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6992.0s)]
*  Don't eat wires. You're gonna die. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6994.0s)]
*  Do you think hitting a dog is necessary for it to listen? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6996.0s)]
*  No. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=6998.0s)]
*  I have a friend who has a dog. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7000.0s)]
*  And I said, wow, your dog's so well behaved. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7002.0s)]
*  I was like, do you hit him? [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7004.0s)]
*  And he goes, that's why he listens. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7006.0s)]
*  I hate that. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7008.0s)]
*  I don't think you should hit dogs. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7010.0s)]
*  But I do think some dogs need some, [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7012.0s)]
*  like there's some aggressive dogs [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7014.0s)]
*  that need to be trained very carefully. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7016.0s)]
*  That I do think. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7018.0s)]
*  And you need to let that dog know [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7020.0s)]
*  that you're the boss. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7022.0s)]
*  And you have to be willing to do that. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7024.0s)]
*  I don't think he hits him, but I think he's hit him. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7026.0s)]
*  I think that changed the dog when he was like, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7028.0s)]
*  because it was a bad dog when he got it. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7030.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7032.0s)]
*  I'm really anti-hitting a dog. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7034.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7036.0s)]
*  That hurts my heart. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7038.0s)]
*  You always wonder if it's like hitting kids. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7040.0s)]
*  Hit kids are more likely to hit other kids. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7042.0s)]
*  I'm more likely to be funny. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7044.0s)]
*  Thanks, Charles. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7046.0s)]
*  You hate your kid? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7048.0s)]
*  They'll come up with some great punch lines. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7050.0s)]
*  Give him a little subtle brain damage. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7052.0s)]
*  Casual, seedy. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7054.0s)]
*  Dr. Drew, I did Dr. Drew earlier today [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7056.0s)]
*  and he told me I was abused on air. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7058.0s)]
*  He was like, have you ever been hit [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7060.0s)]
*  with anything other than a hand? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7062.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7064.0s)]
*  And he was like, that's abuse. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7066.0s)]
*  Anyways, we should take a collar. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7068.0s)]
*  What wooden spoons would they get you with? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7070.0s)]
*  Shoes and... [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7072.0s)]
*  But even being hit with a hand, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7074.0s)]
*  isn't that also abuse? [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7076.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7078.0s)]
*  My parents would do hot sauce too, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7080.0s)]
*  which I heard is really bad now. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7082.0s)]
*  Hot sauce. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7084.0s)]
*  Wash your mouth out with soap. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7086.0s)]
*  It was hot sauce. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7088.0s)]
*  Soap was a white child's blessing, sweetie. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7090.0s)]
*  There's some people that still believe in spanking. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7092.0s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7094.0s)]
*  There's some people that still believe in that. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7096.0s)]
*  I think we should probably move away from violence as punishment [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7098.0s)]
*  as much as we can possibly. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7100.0s)]
*  In general, we should always be moving away from violence. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7102.0s)]
*  As humans and people, we should always be [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7104.0s)]
*  moving towards whatever the nicer thing is. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7106.0s)]
*  But the issue is, hurt people hurt people. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7108.0s)]
*  We're all collectively traumatized. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7110.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7112.0s)]
*  And it keeps going. It passes on. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7114.0s)]
*  But I don't feel like that's true because I was spanked [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7116.0s)]
*  and I have no want to spank a child [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7118.0s)]
*  or need to hit a child or hurt a child. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7120.0s)]
*  But also we know more now, right? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7122.0s)]
*  We know more now. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7124.0s)]
*  And also you've gone through it. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7126.0s)]
*  We were just talking about this yesterday. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7128.0s)]
*  The children of alcoholics, oftentimes they don't even [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7130.0s)]
*  think about drinking. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7132.0s)]
*  They're like, fuck that. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7134.0s)]
*  If you've gone through getting your ass kicked by shoes and belts and things like that, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7136.0s)]
*  you're like, that is not good. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7138.0s)]
*  It wasn't good for me. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7140.0s)]
*  This idea that that's the only way you can learn is crazy. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7142.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7144.0s)]
*  That is crazy. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7146.0s)]
*  It was so common and every parent did it then [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7148.0s)]
*  that it was like, it's crazy. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7150.0s)]
*  And now the parents are like, you're saying we abused you? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7152.0s)]
*  I'm saying everyone abused everyone. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7154.0s)]
*  Everyone seemed to be abused during that time. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7156.0s)]
*  But that is also a thing. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7158.0s)]
*  And it was so normalized. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7160.0s)]
*  If you could go to the 1900s, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7162.0s)]
*  go back to the early 1900s, people would beat the fuck out of their kids. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7164.0s)]
*  People would beat the fuck out of their wives. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7166.0s)]
*  You used to be able to hit your kid at the store. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7168.0s)]
*  In the 90s, people would hit their kids publicly. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7170.0s)]
*  At the store? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7172.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I remember kids getting spanked in public. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7174.0s)]
*  Like when I was younger. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7176.0s)]
*  It's jarring if you see it now. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7178.0s)]
*  When I lived in Florida, they spanked us once. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7180.0s)]
*  I got in a fight with this kid and they spanked both of us. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7182.0s)]
*  The school? [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7184.0s)]
*  Yeah, with a paddle. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7186.0s)]
*  They used a paddle. They paddled you. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7188.0s)]
*  Was it Catholic school? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7190.0s)]
*  No, it was public school. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7192.0s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7194.0s)]
*  I think my friend's mom spanked me once. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7196.0s)]
*  That's crazy! [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7198.0s)]
*  And my mom gave her permission. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7200.0s)]
*  Your mom's like, film it! [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7202.0s)]
*  Hit her! [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7204.0s)]
*  We were bad though. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7206.0s)]
*  Yeah, they used to be able to paddle you in school. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7208.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird that we, I don't know, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7210.0s)]
*  it's a form of abuse, but then people also like getting their ass spanked while they're having sex. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7212.0s)]
*  It's no coincidence that our whole entire generation likes to get spanked and choked. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7218.0s)]
*  I think that's that movie. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7222.0s)]

*  Dude, he says there's this book out and every guy should buy it for his wife. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7248.0s)]
*  Everyone is reading it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7250.0s)]
*  It was like trending on this gift list too. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7252.0s)]
*  I wrote it down. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7254.0s)]
*  Thorns and Roses. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7256.0s)]
*  Yeah! [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7258.0s)]
*  It's called The Court of Thorns and Roses. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7260.0s)]
*  And it's supposed to be amazing. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7262.0s)]
*  It starts rather pleasant. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7264.0s)]
*  What did that say? [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7266.0s)]
*  Can we go back to that? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7268.0s)]
*  It starts rather pleasant. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7270.0s)]
*  Yeah, it starts rather pleasant. Your usual escapist fantasy. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7272.0s)]
*  It quickly subverts into a dark and brutal test of love. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7274.0s)]
*  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7276.0s)]
*  I can see myself stealing ideas for DND tricks. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7278.0s)]
*  Okay, that's embarrassing. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7282.0s)]
*  Leave your DND tricks out of it. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7284.0s)]
*  This is amazing. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7286.0s)]
*  This is so... [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7288.0s)]
*  Tapped into a vein of super nerds. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7290.0s)]

*  Catch me reading fairy porn at home. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7294.0s)]
*  I'm curious. I love fairies. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7296.0s)]
*  I'm not a porn reader. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7298.0s)]
*  Really? I like... I do. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7300.0s)]
*  You're like a fantasy porn reader? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7302.0s)]
*  Getting hot and heavy in the book? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7304.0s)]
*  Women in general prefer reading it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7306.0s)]
*  Whereas men, I think, would prefer watching it. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7308.0s)]
*  All those romance novels like Fabio on the cover. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7310.0s)]
*  Aren't those all kind of like porn for ladies? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7312.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I thought that was for older ladies. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7314.0s)]
*  This is the cool one though. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7316.0s)]
*  This is the updated version. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7318.0s)]
*  Some younger ladies get into it. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7320.0s)]
*  They have all kinds of wacky porn. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7322.0s)]
*  Bigfoot porn. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7324.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7326.0s)]
*  We talked about that I got into. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7328.0s)]
*  Tarzan porn. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7330.0s)]
*  That seems like good porn. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7332.0s)]
*  Lost in the Jungle, Tarzan comes through on the vines. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7334.0s)]
*  Nothing hotter than Tarzan coming through. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7336.0s)]
*  That's my Rose and Thorns. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7340.0s)]
*  A little splash in the jungle. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7342.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, he gives you Chimp VD. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7346.0s)]
*  Not me sharing an STD with a chimp he just fucked. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7348.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7352.0s)]
*  And then the chimp gets mad at you because you're taking his dick away. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7354.0s)]
*  Beef with the chimp? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7356.0s)]
*  Yeah, beef with the female chimp. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7358.0s)]
*  That's not the beef I'm trying to have. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7360.0s)]
*  Do you think Tarzan fucked chimps? [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7362.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7364.0s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think he was doing? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7366.0s)]
*  He lived with them. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7368.0s)]
*  He didn't have a teenage chimp crush, he grew up with them. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7370.0s)]
*  He went to the same high school with the other chimps. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7372.0s)]
*  When they found him, he was a man. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7374.0s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7376.0s)]
*  He wasn't like a boy. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7378.0s)]
*  He was a boy with the chimps. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7380.0s)]
*  Maybe he had a collection of frogs. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7382.0s)]
*  Just mouth-fucked frogs? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7384.0s)]
*  Chimps mouth-fucked frogs. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7386.0s)]
*  You ever seen that? [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7388.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7390.0s)]
*  They hold them and they mouth-fuck them. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7392.0s)]
*  Do you think you can hear it? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7394.0s)]
*  Well, I bet if we find enough videos. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7396.0s)]
*  There's a lot of videos of chimps doing that. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7398.0s)]
*  Wait, chimps mouth-fucked frogs? [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7400.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7402.0s)]

*  This is a nature's pocket pussy. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7414.0s)]
*  Imagine being this frog going, I can't believe this. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7416.0s)]
*  I thought I was the king of the jungle. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7418.0s)]
*  The frogs are out there, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7420.0s)]
*  look at him sticking his dick inside of its mouth. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7422.0s)]
*  He's prying the mouth open with his thumbs. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7424.0s)]
*  He's literally raping the frog. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7426.0s)]
*  He's prying the mouth open with his thumbs. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7428.0s)]
*  Now he's just forcing it to suck on his dick. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7430.0s)]
*  We're watching frog rape. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7432.0s)]
*  But is it rape if it's animals? [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7434.0s)]

*  No. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7544.0s)]
*  Okay, we've talked about cum for Bigfoot. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7546.0s)]
*  I think we maybe have. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7548.0s)]
*  We have talked about cum for Bigfoot and I can't tell if it was a view or another sick friend. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7550.0s)]
*  It might be with me. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7552.0s)]

*  There's not just one. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7564.0s)]
*  I think it's just one lady, Virginia Wade. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7566.0s)]
*  She must be a freak and a half. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7568.0s)]
*  Have you ever heard of the movie Roar? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7570.0s)]

*  Cum for Bigfoot. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7576.0s)]
*  It says on a week long outing in Mount Hood National Forest, what begins as a flirty, fun-filled trip soon turns into a nightmare when an ape-like creature kidnaps a group of teen girls with the purpose of procreating with them. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7578.0s)]
*  Why teen? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7592.0s)]
*  Thus begins the erotic adventure of a lifetime and an inconceivable love story between a young woman and her horny sass pot. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7594.0s)]
*  Okay, hold on. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7602.0s)]
*  I was on board until I found out the girls were teenage. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7604.0s)]
*  Can we make them of age girls? [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7606.0s)]
*  They could be 18. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7608.0s)]
*  You can do whatever you want in a book. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7610.0s)]
*  You can do wild shit in a book. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7612.0s)]
*  I guess you're right. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7614.0s)]
*  You can do wild, horrible things in a book. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7616.0s)]
*  An 18 year old is still a teenager, right? [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7618.0s)]
*  Deal with the demon. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7620.0s)]
*  What is that? [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7622.0s)]
*  That's what you have to read after you cum for Bigfoot. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7624.0s)]
*  That's the same one as relatedness. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7626.0s)]
*  If you had to choose between seeing a UFO or seeing Bigfoot. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7628.0s)]
*  What would you pick? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7632.0s)]
*  UFO. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7634.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7636.0s)]
*  Seeing Bigfoot would freak me out that they're in the woods with us like that. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7638.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7642.0s)]
*  But UFO would be like, okay, it's real. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7644.0s)]
*  It is what it is. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7646.0s)]
*  There's no more mystery. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7648.0s)]
*  UFO is way more interesting to me. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7650.0s)]
*  I feel like if Bigfoot was real and there was a bunch of them, we'd treat them the same way we treat orcas. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7652.0s)]
*  Orcas are amazing. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7656.0s)]
*  That's an amazing creature. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7658.0s)]
*  That's an amazing creature. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7660.0s)]
*  And if it didn't exist, if you heard about an intelligent creature that speaks with sound underwater. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7662.0s)]
*  Like a human? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7666.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's got a brain that's way bigger than a human being's brain. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7668.0s)]
*  Obviously they hunt, they think, they teach each other things. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7672.0s)]
*  There's like video. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7676.0s)]
*  You would say there's no way. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7678.0s)]
*  Who saw it? [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7680.0s)]
*  If there was no footage of it, it was just a myth that there was this creature that was really intelligent that killed the whales. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7682.0s)]
*  Like why? It kills whales? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7688.0s)]
*  What? [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7690.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7692.0s)]
*  What is this thing? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7694.0s)]
*  Yeah, but meanwhile they're real and we're like, yeah, killer whales. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7696.0s)]
*  Oh look, there's an orca. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7698.0s)]
*  That's how we would be like Bigfoot. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7700.0s)]
*  Oh look, there's a Bigfoot. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7702.0s)]
*  Would you rather see a sasquatch and then there's yetis, right? [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7704.0s)]
*  No, one's more like snow. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7706.0s)]
*  One lives in the Himalayas. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7708.0s)]
*  Between the two, I'd rather see the yeti. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7710.0s)]
*  Give me the snowy one. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7712.0s)]
*  Give me the snowy one. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7714.0s)]
*  I feel like if you're in the place where the yeti lives, you fucked up already. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7716.0s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like that too. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7718.0s)]
*  I want the sasquatch, the nice nature. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7720.0s)]
*  What are you doing in the Himalayas? [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7722.0s)]
*  You could be in the Colorado mountains. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7724.0s)]
*  It's nice and then you see a sasquatch and you're like, oh shit. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7726.0s)]

*  Just abduct you into the woods, run over each other. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7732.0s)]
*  Come for yeti doesn't hit the same. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7734.0s)]
*  Yell for yeti. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7736.0s)]

*  A UFO, 100%. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7758.0s)]
*  Who the fuck would want a mermaid? [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7760.0s)]
*  A UFO could be anything. It could be the government, it could be aliens, it could be the government being aliens. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7762.0s)]

*  I can't get into my fairy fantasy on here. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7792.0s)]
*  A mermaid is just like a person with a fish tail. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7794.0s)]
*  Why is it so interesting? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7796.0s)]
*  Fish. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7798.0s)]

*  And we evolved to become like this. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7880.0s)]
*  How long before other things start emerging? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7882.0s)]

*  It is more than chance. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7922.0s)]
*  It's in a room full of people. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7924.0s)]

*  There's also, there's times where, I mean, we're so connected. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7934.0s)]
*  There'll be times where we do shows and we both show up on TV. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7936.0s)]

*  Yeah, but, yeah. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7948.0s)]
*  But that's, you're both more likely to wear pink jackets. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7950.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think we also. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7952.0s)]
*  If I wore a pink jacket and you guys were in a pink jacket, that would seem insane. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7954.0s)]
*  That's true. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7956.0s)]

*  I don't know, I think it's just weird. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7982.0s)]
*  I heard this story about a guy who died in a freezer. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7984.0s)]
*  He worked in a place that had all these freezers and he got locked in one. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7986.0s)]
*  He worked in a place that had all these freezers and he got locked in one. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7988.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7990.0s)]
*  He died from hypothermia. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7992.0s)]
*  He was in a freezer and he got locked in one. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7994.0s)]
*  He was in a freezer and he got locked in one. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7996.0s)]
*  They found out that the freezer... [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=7998.0s)]
*  Now, I don't know if this is a true story. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8000.0s)]
*  I don't even remember. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8002.0s)]
*  I read it, but I read that he died, but they found out that the freezer didn't even work. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8004.0s)]
*  That it had been unplugged. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8006.0s)]
*  The power shut down and then he literally thought he was freezing and killed himself. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8008.0s)]
*  They found claw marks in it and everything. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8010.0s)]
*  How did he kill himself? [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8012.0s)]
*  I don't know, but they said they looked and he had... [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8014.0s)]
*  There's a lot I don't know in this story. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8016.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't remember. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8018.0s)]
*  It was a long time ago. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8020.0s)]
*  His mental state... [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8022.0s)]
*  He tricked himself into thinking he was dying and he died. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8024.0s)]
*  He had a fucking heart attack. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8026.0s)]
*  I'm burning. I'm burning. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8028.0s)]
*  I could see that you could have a heart attack. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8030.0s)]
*  That's possible. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8032.0s)]
*  Then he was trying to claw his way out, but then they said that the freezer wasn't even plugged in. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8034.0s)]
*  Then he would have lived if he would have just fucking... [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8036.0s)]
*  That's deranged. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8038.0s)]
*  Chilled out a little. No pun intended. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8040.0s)]
*  How do you even fit into a freezer? [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8042.0s)]
*  How do you not know it's not cold? [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8044.0s)]
*  How do you not know it's not cold? [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8046.0s)]

*  You really think you're freezing as ass. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8050.0s)]
*  But if you're in there and you're like... [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8052.0s)]
*  I remember being a kid... [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8054.0s)]
*  I think it's a big one. It's probably cold for a while. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8056.0s)]
*  And wanting to go into the refrigerator as a kid. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8058.0s)]
*  Being like... opening it. My mom being like, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8060.0s)]

*  Oh yeah, you want to go in there like a bug. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8064.0s)]
*  That's a weird thing. That's in horror movies. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8066.0s)]
*  Where the evil grandmother was like, let me see if you fit in that oven. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8068.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8070.0s)]

*  They're in the middle of the woods. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8166.0s)]
*  And just these people show up. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8168.0s)]
*  And then they go through this whole night where they're being tortured and murdered. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8170.0s)]
*  And at the end of the movie, they asked them, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8172.0s)]
*  they're like, why are you doing this? [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8174.0s)]
*  And they're like, because you were home. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8176.0s)]
*  And it's like, no, it's just a movie about demented people. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8178.0s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8180.0s)]
*  That's why you need firearms. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8182.0s)]
*  The strangers make you believe in the right to bear arms. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8184.0s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8186.0s)]
*  You can fix that problem real quick. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8188.0s)]
*  You'll see them skedaddling with their masks off quick. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8190.0s)]
*  Remember when we saw [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8192.0s)]
*  Hailey Joel Osmond on the plane [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8194.0s)]
*  and we knew it was him because of his eyes? [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8196.0s)]
*  He had a mask on. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8198.0s)]
*  We see those funky eyes from here. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8200.0s)]
*  Do you see dead people? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8202.0s)]
*  This kid from Signs. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8204.0s)]
*  He had a mask on. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8206.0s)]
*  And I know his eyes. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8208.0s)]
*  That movie fucking changed my life. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8210.0s)]
*  Signs really stayed with me. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8212.0s)]
*  Not Signs. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8214.0s)]
*  The Sixth Sense. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8216.0s)]
*  Signs really stayed with you? [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8218.0s)]
*  Signs was the first movie I ever got fingered in. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8220.0s)]
*  The first time I ever got fingered was in Signs. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8222.0s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8224.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8226.0s)]
*  He does have very distinct eyes. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8228.0s)]
*  Look at his eyes again. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8230.0s)]
*  The only person who has eyes that distinct besides him are Bushemi. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8232.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's got eyes you can't miss. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8234.0s)]
*  Like you can't wear a mask and be like, [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8236.0s)]
*  I was like, okay, Hailey Joel, have fun. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8238.0s)]
*  He looks like he could be like a Russian wrestler. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8240.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8242.0s)]
*  Like Yuri Bostorov. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8244.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8246.0s)]
*  From Bulgaria. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8248.0s)]
*  He did that trippy movie AI. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8250.0s)]
*  Remember that one where it was about [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8252.0s)]
*  the couple where they got so advanced [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8254.0s)]
*  that you could buy a child if you lost a child [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8256.0s)]
*  that you could buy a very realistic version of one [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8258.0s)]
*  for your grief. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8260.0s)]
*  And it would like learn to love you. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8262.0s)]
*  And then their child actually came back from the coma. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8264.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8266.0s)]
*  So you have two kids. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8268.0s)]
*  The robot kid. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8270.0s)]
*  Oh god damn it. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8272.0s)]
*  Is that the robot falling apart? [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8274.0s)]
*  That's because the other son would taunt him [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8276.0s)]
*  because he could really eat. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8278.0s)]
*  And so the robot kid started almost feeling like, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8280.0s)]
*  well, if he can eat, I can eat. I'm the real son too. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8282.0s)]
*  And then it started like, things went bad. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8284.0s)]
*  Oh boy, I never saw that movie. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8286.0s)]
*  Oh, it's so crazy. It's so trippy. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8288.0s)]
*  And then eventually like the robot lives forever, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8290.0s)]
*  but he actually loves this family and this woman like a mother. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8292.0s)]
*  But then eventually everyone dies out [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8294.0s)]
*  and he's like still like the one. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8296.0s)]
*  Oh, you're spoiler alerted the shit out of that movie. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8298.0s)]
*  When did that movie come out? [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8300.0s)]
*  In 1990. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8302.0s)]
*  2001 is a long time ago. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8304.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, I couldn't hold it in any longer. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8306.0s)]
*  I've been waiting of a while to talk to this guy. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8308.0s)]
*  There's this thing that somebody sent me online. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8312.0s)]
*  Haley Joel was six in it. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8316.0s)]
*  There's this thing that someone sent me online [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8320.0s)]
*  where you can make an AI generated boyfriend. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8322.0s)]
*  And you can literally... [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8326.0s)]
*  I like when it goes silent and a star just goes across the sky. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8328.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of AI generated girls on OnlyFans. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8330.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8334.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8336.0s)]
*  But you can literally have a relationship. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8338.0s)]
*  100%. Tell me that's true. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8340.0s)]
*  You can make your own boyfriend on AI. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8342.0s)]
*  I have no interest in him. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8344.0s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8346.0s)]
*  Osment was Spielberg's first and only choice for the role. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8348.0s)]
*  To betray the character, Osment avoided blinking his eyes [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8350.0s)]
*  and programmed himself with good posture. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8352.0s)]
*  It's something that I saw on a Reddit post [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8356.0s)]
*  that said he didn't blink for a year. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8358.0s)]
*  He played a robot boy so well. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8362.0s)]
*  This movie is trippy as fuck. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8366.0s)]
*  I bet the trailer is crazy too. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8368.0s)]
*  Wait, what do you mean? [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8370.0s)]
*  How do you not blink for an entire year? [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8372.0s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8374.0s)]
*  What happens when you go to sleep? [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8376.0s)]
*  Listen, we saw him on the plane. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8378.0s)]
*  Something happened to him. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8380.0s)]
*  He closed his eyes. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8382.0s)]
*  It doesn't count as a blink. It's not quick. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8384.0s)]
*  Now I'm trying to think about blinking. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8386.0s)]
*  Blinking is pretty quick. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8388.0s)]
*  How do you not blink for a whole year? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8390.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I don't blink. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8392.0s)]
*  I'm sure when no one was looking he was getting a few in. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8394.0s)]
*  Don't worry you guys. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8396.0s)]
*  That's like not shitting for a whole year. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8398.0s)]
*  I can't believe this is his actual title. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8400.0s)]
*  He wasn't allowed to blink. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8402.0s)]
*  Stop blinking. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8404.0s)]
*  Stop it again. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8406.0s)]
*  This is so stupid. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8408.0s)]
*  That was the director's notes. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8410.0s)]
*  You have to stop blinking. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8412.0s)]
*  It stops blinking for one year. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8414.0s)]
*  When Spielberg tells you not to blink, you stop blinking. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8416.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8418.0s)]
*  Spielberg, if you're listening, I will not blink. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8420.0s)]
*  If you put me in a movie, I'll stop blinking for a year. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8422.0s)]
*  I'll stop blinking for a year too. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8424.0s)]
*  You guys think you play good robots? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8426.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8428.0s)]
*  You both went into robot mode. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8430.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8432.0s)]
*  How long before you think we're going to go over someone's house [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8434.0s)]
*  and they're going to have a robot cleaning up? [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8438.0s)]
*  Remember that show Small Wonder? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8440.0s)]
*  No. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8442.0s)]
*  Small Wonder Vicky was one of my favorite shows. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8444.0s)]
*  She was just like this house robot. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8446.0s)]
*  You guys don't know what I'm talking about. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8448.0s)]
*  It was one of my favorite shows. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8450.0s)]
*  Even Kim's looking at you. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8452.0s)]
*  Small Wonder. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8454.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Small Wonder. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8456.0s)]
*  No one talks about it. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8458.0s)]
*  People need to talk more about Small Wonder. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8460.0s)]
*  Look, she's a robot. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8462.0s)]
*  I grew up watching this. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8464.0s)]
*  She's a broken robot. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8466.0s)]
*  What is she doing? [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8468.0s)]
*  What the fuck were you watching as a child? [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8470.0s)]
*  That's what makes her a robot, that she shrugs her shoulders. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8472.0s)]
*  No, she cleans and she does a lot of stuff. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8474.0s)]
*  What? [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8476.0s)]
*  No, this is really weird. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8478.0s)]
*  You watched this movie? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8480.0s)]
*  This is serious. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8482.0s)]
*  It was my favorite show. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8484.0s)]
*  This is why you need Adderall. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8486.0s)]
*  You see her outfit? I'd like to wear that. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8488.0s)]
*  This did something to you as a child. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8490.0s)]
*  How have you guys never seen this? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8492.0s)]
*  Ew, I hate this. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8494.0s)]
*  And if you look at her back. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8496.0s)]
*  Oh my god, this is the most offensive show of all time. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8498.0s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8500.0s)]
*  It was my favorite show. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8502.0s)]
*  She's got sparks coming out of her back. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8504.0s)]
*  Sparks coming out of her back. She's broken at one point. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8506.0s)]
*  And one time she starts smoking cigarettes and she's like, it's crazy. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8508.0s)]
*  Did she have the personality of a child? [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8512.0s)]
*  Whoa, imagine that, she's fucking up your kids. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8514.0s)]
*  He has a prisoner in his own home. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8520.0s)]
*  He has a good point. The parent should reconsider Vicky living there. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8522.0s)]
*  The parents are letting this robot pick your fucking kid up and threaten it with violence. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8524.0s)]
*  I mean, have some control in that house. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8526.0s)]
*  Look at her back. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8528.0s)]
*  Her back is all like digital. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8530.0s)]
*  She kind of looks like a young you. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8532.0s)]
*  I was obsessed with this show. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8534.0s)]
*  She would be vacuuming, she'd be smoking cigarettes. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8536.0s)]
*  It was one of my favorite shows growing up. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8538.0s)]
*  Small kid, small Vicky. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8540.0s)]
*  I was going to be here for Halloween one year. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8542.0s)]
*  But I thought it was more mainstream. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8544.0s)]
*  No, a lot of people would be here. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8546.0s)]
*  I was going to be here for Halloween one year. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8548.0s)]
*  But I thought it was more mainstream. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8550.0s)]
*  No, a lot of people know Small Wonder. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8552.0s)]
*  I'm shocked you guys don't, to be honest. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8554.0s)]
*  No, I do. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8556.0s)]
*  How long was it on for? [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8558.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8560.0s)]
*  One season, 1985. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8562.0s)]
*  That's it? [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8564.0s)]
*  It was always on my TV. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8566.0s)]
*  It had to be there from January to March. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8568.0s)]
*  I thought they had like 10 seasons because it was always on. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8570.0s)]
*  Sweetie, January through March, 85, if you call Small Wonder, you are hooked. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8572.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8574.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, it had a couple of runs. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8576.0s)]
*  Okay, how many? [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8578.0s)]
*  Three to four. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8580.0s)]
*  Are you what? [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8582.0s)]
*  Are you what? [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8584.0s)]
*  A robot? [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8586.0s)]
*  Are you? [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8588.0s)]
*  I don't remember what I was going to say. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8590.0s)]
*  Are you okay? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8592.0s)]
*  Are you still on Adderall? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8594.0s)]
*  No. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8596.0s)]
*  Do you wish you were? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8598.0s)]
*  No. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8600.0s)]
*  You never want to taste? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8602.0s)]
*  It feels really nice to be able to sleep. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8604.0s)]
*  I was on it for so long. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8606.0s)]
*  When you're on it, it's really hard to live in the present moment when you're just thinking about sending emails. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8608.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8618.0s)]
*  I didn't really have much inner peace when I was on it. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8620.0s)]
*  I've got to tell you, I can't imagine how you were living because you constantly still think about emails. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8624.0s)]
*  She thinks about emails more than anyone I know. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8628.0s)]
*  It was just like a hundred times whatever. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8630.0s)]
*  She's already on top of it. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8632.0s)]
*  She already is whatever it's doing. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8634.0s)]
*  Maybe it rewired you. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8636.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8638.0s)]
*  Maybe it made you more, those are grooves that you naturally go into now. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8640.0s)]
*  Because of the neural pathways or something. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8644.0s)]
*  It dug something new. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8646.0s)]
*  Yeah, it dug some new corridors. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8648.0s)]
*  The one thing about it was it would make me a bitch. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8650.0s)]
*  Because you would take it, I would take it. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8654.0s)]
*  She had some spunk back in 2007. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8658.0s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8660.0s)]
*  You start coming down from it and you're kind of just like aggro. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8662.0s)]
*  Oh, that makes sense. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8666.0s)]
*  You're like, ugh. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8668.0s)]
*  When did you stop taking it? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8670.0s)]
*  In 2019. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8672.0s)]
*  Right after Brody died. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8674.0s)]
*  It was literally, Brody died and I was like, I need to stop taking it. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8676.0s)]
*  I don't know, because I was so sad I just wanted to sleep. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8678.0s)]
*  So I just stopped taking it cold turkey. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8680.0s)]
*  And then I went into a psychosis and ever since then I've never taken it again. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8682.0s)]
*  How long the psychosis last? [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8686.0s)]
*  Like three days. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8688.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8690.0s)]
*  I feel like it lasted longer for you because before you even left there was a few days of it built up to it. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8692.0s)]
*  It was like a slow creep. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8698.0s)]
*  I don't think it just hit and was three days and was over. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8700.0s)]
*  It was almost like you're being, especially with my experience with you, I was being gaslit. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8702.0s)]
*  Not gaslit, but I'm like, is she off or am I just being judgmental? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8708.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8714.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8716.0s)]
*  There's a few days where you're like, I think something's off or maybe she's in a really good mood. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8718.0s)]
*  And you kind of not sure to question it or maybe I'm off and I'm annoyed by her good mood. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8720.0s)]
*  But I'm like, something's weird. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8726.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, going to the psych ward will change you. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8728.0s)]
*  72 hours psychiatric hold will do something to you. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8732.0s)]
*  What happened in there? [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8734.0s)]
*  When I got there. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8736.0s)]
*  Good food, apparently. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8738.0s)]
*  The best food. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8740.0s)]
*  The best food. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8742.0s)]
*  But also I probably wasn't eating for like 10 years because I was cracked down on that. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8744.0s)]
*  It was just food. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8746.0s)]
*  It was actually just food. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8748.0s)]
*  The best part of being in there was there was like a music segment where this old guy would come in and he'd have like a tambourine and we'd all sit around. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8750.0s)]
*  Some old retirement home entertainment going on. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8762.0s)]
*  It was like the only thing I looked forward to, the music time. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8766.0s)]
*  Because it was just like four mentally ill people being like, what song do you want to hear? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8770.0s)]
*  Can you do Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young? [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8776.0s)]
*  He's like, I can. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8778.0s)]
*  I'm like, great. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8780.0s)]
*  It sounds kooky in there. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8782.0s)]
*  It's very kooky. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8784.0s)]
*  There was a guy who I remember I looked over and he wasn't wearing pants. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8786.0s)]
*  And he was on the phone with his wife. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8790.0s)]
*  And when you're on the phone, the phone's a short cord so you don't hang yourself with it. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8792.0s)]
*  Let me tell you. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8796.0s)]
*  This dude with no pants right next to the phone. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8798.0s)]
*  Dude, this chick, I became friends with this chick. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8804.0s)]
*  She's like, we got to get a lawyer to get out of here. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8810.0s)]
*  I was like, you're right. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8812.0s)]
*  I'm like calling my parents, I'm like, I need a lawyer to get out of here. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8814.0s)]
*  They're like, we put you in there. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8816.0s)]
*  You're not getting a lawyer to get out of there. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8818.0s)]
*  Oh my god, that's hilarious. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8822.0s)]
*  Alright ladies, I'm going to wrap this up. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfmLQIdA_1M&t=8824.0s)]
