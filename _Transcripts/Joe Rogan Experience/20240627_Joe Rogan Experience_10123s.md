# Joe Rogan Experience #2089 - Joey Diaz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0)
*  Joe Rogan Podcast, check it out! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4.0s)]
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6.0s)]
*  I didn't bring no motherfucking glasses, though. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=13.0s)]
*  Oh, do you need some? I have some. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=15.0s)]
*  Just in case, if you're gonna show me something interesting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=17.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=20.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=21.0s)]
*  So I started doing this red light bed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=24.0s)]
*  I started doing two things to help my eyes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=27.0s)]
*  One, I started taking pure encapsulations. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=29.0s)]
*  They have this, what is it called? Macro support? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=32.0s)]
*  What is it called? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=38.0s)]
*  Anyway, it's a bunch of supplements that they put together to stop your eyesight from going bad. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=42.0s)]
*  And it's legit. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=49.0s)]
*  Macular support? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=50.0s)]
*  Macular support, that's it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=51.0s)]
*  You like it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=53.0s)]
*  Legit. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=54.0s)]
*  It's legit. It stopped whatever the deterioration that I was experiencing, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=55.0s)]
*  where my eyesight was starting to go, it stopped. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=59.0s)]
*  Just stopped it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=62.0s)]
*  And it made it a little bit better. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=63.0s)]
*  And then I started doing this red light bed. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=65.0s)]
*  So I had this guy, Gary Breck, on the podcast. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=67.0s)]
*  He's explained to me how red light revitalizes your capillaries and helps your vision come back. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=69.0s)]
*  And so I've been doing that now for about six weeks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=77.0s)]
*  And I've noticed an improvement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=80.0s)]
*  I don't need reading glasses as much if I'm reading things on my phone. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=82.0s)]
*  I can read some things that I just was not going to be able to read. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=86.0s)]
*  And more importantly, it's not getting worse. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=89.0s)]
*  Because it was like every six months, eight months or so, I'd notice, my god, my eyes are worse. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=91.0s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=97.0s)]
*  After like 46, it seemed like, somewhere around 46, it was like it dropped off a cliff. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=98.0s)]
*  And you did the right thing, because you didn't submit to these. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=104.0s)]
*  My mistake was to submit to these when I was like 43. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=108.0s)]
*  By 44, I could see I was having problems already. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=111.0s)]
*  And I submitted to these. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=114.0s)]
*  And this is worse for you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=116.0s)]
*  That's why I used to tell you, don't put the glasses on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=117.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=120.0s)]
*  Make your eyes muscle, that thing. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=121.0s)]
*  It's like when you wear fucking hearing aids. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=123.0s)]
*  Like your hearing gets lost. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=126.0s)]
*  Well, they say with vision, like the problem is we're looking at things that are real close up all the time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=128.0s)]
*  And your eyes are supposed to do a bunch of different things. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=133.0s)]
*  They're supposed to look at stuff in the distance. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=137.0s)]
*  They're supposed to look at things up close. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=138.0s)]
*  And if you don't look at things in the distance all the time, you lose that ability. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=140.0s)]
*  Well, I'm going to be as honest as I can with you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=144.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to be cute here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=146.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=147.0s)]
*  I lost my eyesight when I stopped doing coke. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=148.0s)]
*  Because when I was doing coke, my eyesight was on point, John. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=150.0s)]
*  I could see a light from fucking two miles away. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=153.0s)]
*  That light's green. We got to make it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=156.0s)]
*  Once I stopped doing coke, my eyesight went right into the fucking shit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=157.0s)]
*  So when I was snorting, I had 20-20 vision. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=162.0s)]
*  I could see coke rocks in the carpet and shit. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=164.0s)]
*  Now I can't see shit if there's a coke rock on the fucking floor. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=167.0s)]
*  I guess it's blood flow. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=171.0s)]
*  If you think about a blood flow to the brain, doesn't coke give you a crazy amount of blood flow to your brain? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=173.0s)]
*  I mean, it must. It's a stimulant, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=178.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I have no idea where the blood goes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=180.0s)]
*  Thank God I never got into that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=182.0s)]
*  No. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=184.0s)]
*  Thank God I never got into that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=185.0s)]
*  And especially now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=186.0s)]
*  Now I see these people that are snorting anything. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=187.0s)]
*  To snort anything today, you've got to be fucking crazy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=189.0s)]
*  Heroin, these people who put the fucking test. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=192.0s)]
*  Like if you go to a bar in New York, they have tests. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=197.0s)]
*  Then you go in the bathroom and they're like, are you fucking kidding me? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=198.0s)]
*  They have to. You don't want to die. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=200.0s)]
*  Once you test cocaine, it's time to do something different. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=201.0s)]
*  If you got to test your coke, it's time to do something different. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=204.0s)]
*  You got to fucking... [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=208.0s)]
*  You know what's going on here? Ketamine. Everybody's doing ketamine. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=209.0s)]
*  They do nasal sprays. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=212.0s)]
*  We had some lady going to a K-hole in the middle of our comedy show. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=214.0s)]
*  She's fucking falling down like this. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=219.0s)]
*  And they brought in the Narcan and shit. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=221.0s)]
*  They were worried that she had overdosed. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=224.0s)]
*  And her wife was like, no, no, no. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=226.0s)]
*  She's just been doing ketamine. She just did too much. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=228.0s)]
*  She did too much. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=230.0s)]
*  So I did a couple of lines of that one time at the podcast studio. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=234.0s)]
*  And it was okay. I did the podcast. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=235.0s)]
*  But whoever gave me the ketamine left like a pile of it on the desk. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=237.0s)]
*  You know, after we did a couple of lines. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=242.0s)]
*  So he left and me and Lee were talking. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=244.0s)]
*  And I go, Lee, what are we going to do with this fucking thing? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=246.0s)]
*  He goes, I don't know. Throw it away. I go, fuck that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=248.0s)]
*  It was about 8, 30, 9 o'clock at night. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=250.0s)]
*  I had done three lines maybe and I was buzzed, but it didn't take me over the top. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=253.0s)]
*  I did those. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=258.0s)]
*  Now I lived six minutes from the podcast studio in LA. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=260.0s)]
*  When I got to the first light to make the left, I knew it was not going to be a good drive home. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=265.0s)]
*  It was not going to be a good drive home. Okay. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=270.0s)]
*  I had done too much. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=274.0s)]
*  And then I got home. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=275.0s)]
*  And when I put my foot out of the car, that was it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=277.0s)]
*  It was lights out after that. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=280.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I am fucked up. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=282.0s)]
*  What do you mean like lights out? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=284.0s)]
*  Like I was fucked up. I don't know what was going on. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=286.0s)]
*  It's a different kind of fucked up, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=289.0s)]
*  It's a different type of fucked up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=291.0s)]
*  And then I went in the house and god damn it, my wife is awake. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=292.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=296.0s)]
*  Now I got to talk to her. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=297.0s)]
*  So I ran in my office and I'm in there 15 minutes getting higher and higher. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=299.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=305.0s)]
*  And shit, my body's feeling weird. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=306.0s)]
*  And I go, I better go out there before she comes and hit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=308.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=312.0s)]
*  And she was watching True. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=313.0s)]
*  True Crimes? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=316.0s)]
*  Detective. Whatever. On HBO. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=318.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=320.0s)]
*  And it was the dude from the Green Book and the other guy. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=321.0s)]
*  The Green Book. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=324.0s)]
*  The brother. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=325.0s)]
*  The guy who won the, he was in the movie, the Green Book with the guy who drove him in the South. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=326.0s)]
*  He played the piano player. Anyway, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=330.0s)]
*  So you know I saw the Green Book? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=333.0s)]
*  I don't think I saw the Green Book. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=335.0s)]
*  That's a good fucking movie. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, we were talking about him yesterday. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=337.0s)]
*  Marshal Ali. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=339.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=340.0s)]
*  That guy's awesome. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=341.0s)]
*  He's awesome. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=342.0s)]
*  He was great in that Netflix documentary, the Netflix show we were just talking about, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=343.0s)]
*  about the end of the world with Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=346.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't see that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=349.0s)]
*  It was good. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=350.0s)]
*  Fucking Yannis hated it though, huh? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=351.0s)]
*  He's trying to get me to hate it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=353.0s)]
*  I kind of went with him a little bit. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=355.0s)]
*  Right? He influenced me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=357.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, there were some parts I didn't like. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=359.0s)]
*  The CG animals. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=361.0s)]
*  Getting picky. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=363.0s)]
*  Yeah, a bunch of CGI animals staring at people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=364.0s)]
*  I'm like, come on. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=366.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=367.0s)]
*  You don't need to do this to me. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=368.0s)]
*  No. No, but I looked at him and while I was watching TV, his head kept getting bigger. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=369.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I couldn't take it. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=374.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there. I got no t-shirt on. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=376.0s)]
*  I'm sweating profusely. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=378.0s)]
*  She's kind of looking at me. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=379.0s)]
*  I'm kind of looking at her. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=381.0s)]
*  Your wife is a fucking angel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=383.0s)]
*  And finally, I couldn't take it no more. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=384.0s)]
*  I couldn't take it no more. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=387.0s)]
*  And I go, what the hell is going on here? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=388.0s)]
*  And she says, what? What? I'll change it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=390.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=392.0s)]
*  I told her the next morning. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=393.0s)]
*  I said, let me tell you something. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=394.0s)]
*  When I came last night, I was not doing too good. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=396.0s)]
*  You know, people think that you fuck around. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=398.0s)]
*  Like when I was living in LA, people think like you fuck around and you don't have no... [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=401.0s)]
*  Everybody always thinks like I just got high and had no fucking consequences. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=404.0s)]
*  I just never told you about what I dealt with. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=408.0s)]
*  You know, one night I ate mushrooms and I went home and the fucking mushrooms hit. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=410.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=415.0s)]
*  I ate like three little fucking things at the office. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=416.0s)]
*  The mushrooms hit. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=418.0s)]
*  And that's the day the exorcists came on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=419.0s)]
*  And I had to watch it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=421.0s)]
*  And I'm like, what the... [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=422.0s)]
*  And I finally ran into the room and put the blankets over my head. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=423.0s)]
*  It was too fucking real. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=425.0s)]
*  Like I have horrible high stories. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=427.0s)]
*  I just don't repeat them because, you know, people won't believe them. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=430.0s)]
*  I remember when we were on a plane once and you were eating stars at death. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=433.0s)]
*  And we were like almost at New York. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=437.0s)]
*  And it was like an hour before the plane landed. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=440.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=442.0s)]
*  I almost fucking lost it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=443.0s)]
*  I almost fucking lost it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=445.0s)]
*  I was having a pan attack. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=446.0s)]
*  It was getting bad. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=447.0s)]
*  It was getting bad. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=448.0s)]
*  And then you go, but I'm back. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=449.0s)]
*  And then you pop two more. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=451.0s)]
*  I'm like, how did you just fucking do that? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=453.0s)]
*  You just had a panic attack almost. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=455.0s)]
*  You know, for three years I cried about this anxiety, anxiety. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=457.0s)]
*  I can't take it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=461.0s)]
*  Fucking, I don't do edibles now. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=462.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=465.0s)]
*  Monday nights. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=466.0s)]
*  So it was the edibles that was giving you the anxiety? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=467.0s)]
*  You said it yourself. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=469.0s)]
*  You can't live on a 2,000 milligrams a goddamn day. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=470.0s)]
*  Something's got to fall apart eventually. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=476.0s)]
*  You know, that was kicking it up. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=477.0s)]
*  And then I would get, anytime I would get above 200 milligrams, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=479.0s)]
*  the whole world was just like very slippery, very slippery. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=483.0s)]
*  I was like, this is like, I could see how edibles can get someone to legitimately lose their mind. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=488.0s)]
*  That's why when I was talking to Alex Berenson, he wrote that book, Tell Your Children, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=495.0s)]
*  it's all about schizophrenia and about how there are people that get introduced to high doses of marijuana [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=499.0s)]
*  and it induces schizophrenia. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=505.0s)]
*  We know people, we both know a couple of people that have had that happen to. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=506.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is real. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=510.0s)]
*  I think marijuana is very beneficial in low to moderate doses. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=512.0s)]
*  But you get above certain doses with certain psychologies, certain people, certain times of their life, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=516.0s)]
*  you know, certain things they're going through. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=522.0s)]
*  You never know. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=524.0s)]
*  You could fucking crack. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=525.0s)]
*  You never know. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=526.0s)]
*  You could. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=527.0s)]
*  And I can tell you that, that's the truth. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=530.0s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=531.0s)]
*  Because at times, you know. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=532.0s)]
*  It gets, marijuana at the high doses is not what people think it is. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=534.0s)]
*  It gets to that very psychedelic place where it's like, this might as well be acid. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=539.0s)]
*  Like the real high doses, there was some time where Eddie Bravo had these THC pills. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=544.0s)]
*  One of his students had made his own pills, had like turned keef into pills. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=551.0s)]
*  I forget how many we took, but I was talking to this one dude and like, I might as well have been in another dimension. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=557.0s)]
*  Like my relationship to reality was very slippery. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=563.0s)]
*  I was like, if I was losing my mind right now, if I wasn't in a good place in my life, my, you know, life is falling apart. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=567.0s)]
*  Maybe you're, you know, getting fired, your house is repossessed, going through a divorce, maybe you have cancer, who knows? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=574.0s)]
*  Whatever it is. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=580.0s)]
*  And then you get that dose. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=581.0s)]
*  They could send you over the top. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=583.0s)]
*  Bro, I had a guy come over from Jiu Jitsu one day. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=585.0s)]
*  We were just hanging out. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=587.0s)]
*  He goes, I want to do a bong hit with you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=588.0s)]
*  I gave him two bong hits and when I smoked, he puked in my yard. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=590.0s)]
*  He was like, I don't know how you do this every day. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=594.0s)]
*  Two fucking bong hits. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=597.0s)]
*  We got to light them up. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=599.0s)]
*  Well, it's also like when someone runs marathons, you try to run a marathon with them. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=600.0s)]
*  I don't know how you run a marathon. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=604.0s)]
*  Well, you fucking got to build up to it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=605.0s)]
*  You're building up to that too. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=608.0s)]
*  It's all building up, you know? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=610.0s)]
*  This new weed that's coming out now, these people aren't ready for it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=613.0s)]
*  It's too strong. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=617.0s)]
*  And more people are smoking pot now than ever before, whether it's vapor pens. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=618.0s)]
*  Everybody's doing something. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=623.0s)]
*  Is that like because it's legal, right? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=625.0s)]
*  I wonder what the numbers are because it's legal in what is it now, Jamie, 19 states? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=628.0s)]
*  I feel like we're close to 20, 20, 23. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=633.0s)]
*  Share a lot of states. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=636.0s)]
*  It's decriminalized in the city of Austin, but it's legal in a lot of states like New Jersey, New York, California, recreational use. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=637.0s)]
*  Nevada, Colorado, Oregon. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=647.0s)]
*  I would imagine there's more people smoking it now just because of that, because it's legal, right? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=650.0s)]
*  You got to come home from work. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=656.0s)]
*  Instead of getting beer or whatever the fuck you get, you go and you get one of these joints for 25 bucks. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=658.0s)]
*  This will last the regular person the whole weekend. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=663.0s)]
*  And it doesn't kill your body. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=667.0s)]
*  It doesn't kill you. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=668.0s)]
*  It doesn't kill your body. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=669.0s)]
*  That's the big one. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=670.0s)]
*  For me, like when I was doing jujitsu every day, if I was getting high and doing jujitsu, it actually made my jujitsu better. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=671.0s)]
*  Like I felt like my jujitsu was more smooth. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=680.0s)]
*  I was more focused, but I never felt wrecked the next day. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=683.0s)]
*  But if I drank the night before and then tried to go into class the next day, I always felt like 30 percent less. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=686.0s)]
*  I was like, this is terrible. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=693.0s)]
*  So I stopped drinking because every time I would go out drinking and then I go into class, I just get drunk. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=695.0s)]
*  I just get manhandled. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=700.0s)]
*  I just get wrecked. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=702.0s)]
*  I just couldn't keep up. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=703.0s)]
*  And when you're hungover, it's the worst feeling. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=705.0s)]
*  What have I done to myself for just a few hours of fun? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=708.0s)]
*  You know, it's really crazy that we don't really know what alcohol does to our bodies, but it's not good. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=711.0s)]
*  You know how you find out? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=718.0s)]
*  Get one of those aura rings. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=719.0s)]
*  Get an aura ring or a whoop strap, one of those whoop straps. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=721.0s)]
*  I got one. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=724.0s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=725.0s)]
*  Check your whoop strap. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=726.0s)]
*  Have a couple of cocktails. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=727.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=728.0s)]
*  Check your whoop strap. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=729.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=730.0s)]
*  Like two drinks, two glasses of wine. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=731.0s)]
*  Your recovery will be way down. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=732.0s)]
*  The whoop strap is very beneficial for that because it tracks your heart rate variability and it gives you like a real accurate assessment of what happens when you fuck around with things. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=734.0s)]
*  Because if you just do something different, like I just cut out sugar. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=744.0s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=747.0s)]
*  Look at how much better my recovery is. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=748.0s)]
*  You know, oh, I stopped drinking alcohol. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=749.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=751.0s)]
*  Recovery through the roof. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=752.0s)]
*  I committed to drinking X amount of liters of water every day. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=753.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=756.0s)]
*  Look at all this recovery. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=757.0s)]
*  Look, my body's functioning better. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=758.0s)]
*  You know, it's like it gives you real feedback. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=759.0s)]
*  Well, I was telling your buddy that when I got the whoop, it was for recovery purposes. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=761.0s)]
*  I don't like being that fucking sore. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=768.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=770.0s)]
*  So I want to know where I am throughout the day. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=771.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=773.0s)]
*  I got the whoop and I got to be honest with you. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=774.0s)]
*  You know what improved the best? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=775.0s)]
*  What? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=777.0s)]
*  My sleep. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=778.0s)]
*  Because when I got the whoop, we all think we sleep eight hours. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=779.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=781.0s)]
*  Everybody thinks they sleep fucking eight hours. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=782.0s)]
*  Get the fucking whoop and get back to me. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=784.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=786.0s)]
*  You're sleeping 545, 610, and you're like, this ain't working. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=787.0s)]
*  So I started doing things to help my sleep. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=792.0s)]
*  Joe, do you know I sleep eight now? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=794.0s)]
*  And at four o'clock, five o'clock, I got to go down for an hour. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=796.0s)]
*  Every day. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=801.0s)]
*  Take a nap. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=802.0s)]
*  You know when I took, I never took a fucking nap since you know me. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=803.0s)]
*  Take a nap. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=806.0s)]
*  One hour. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=808.0s)]
*  Get up. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=809.0s)]
*  I feel tip top Magoo. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=810.0s)]
*  And that's when I start smoking weed and having a good time. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=811.0s)]
*  You know, I can function on five. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=815.0s)]
*  I do well on six. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=819.0s)]
*  When I'm doing eight plus, I'm at my best. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=821.0s)]
*  I know the difference. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=824.0s)]
*  Like there's days that I come in here where maybe I had a late show, got out of the club late, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=826.0s)]
*  and then maybe I had to take the kids to school in the morning, or maybe I had an appointment, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=831.0s)]
*  or maybe I had something I had to do so I had to get up early so I only got like five or six. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=835.0s)]
*  I can function. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=838.0s)]
*  But in my mind, I'm like, that's a check I have to pay. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=839.0s)]
*  That's a bill I have to pay. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=842.0s)]
*  So I have to make sure tonight I get like 10 or 11. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=843.0s)]
*  Tonight I really want to get some serious sleep. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=846.0s)]
*  No booze. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=849.0s)]
*  Hit the sauna. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=850.0s)]
*  Hit the cold. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=851.0s)]
*  Get my body prepped. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=852.0s)]
*  Sauna and a cold plunge before you go to bed. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=854.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you sleep like a baby. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=856.0s)]
*  You sleep like a baby. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=858.0s)]
*  You sleep so good. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=859.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=860.0s)]
*  I haven't worked myself up to the cold plunge yet, but I do the red light sauna twice a week. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=861.0s)]
*  You can do it right now. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=865.0s)]
*  Red light sauna's great. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=866.0s)]
*  I think any sauna's great. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=869.0s)]
*  Any sauna's great. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=871.0s)]
*  Even a hot bath is great. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=872.0s)]
*  The whole idea is just warming your body up. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=873.0s)]
*  Just getting your body so it's uncomfortable. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=875.0s)]
*  But the real studies are on the regular sauna. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=877.0s)]
*  We got a Salus sauna. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=881.0s)]
*  I have that for here and that for my house. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=884.0s)]
*  They're the shit, man. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=886.0s)]
*  The one we have here is so nice. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=887.0s)]
*  It's set up. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=890.0s)]
*  It's all Bluetooth. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=891.0s)]
*  You set it up off your phone. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=892.0s)]
*  Like so you're on your way to the gym. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=893.0s)]
*  We're on the way to the gym. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=895.0s)]
*  Set the sauna $190. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=896.0s)]
*  Get here. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=897.0s)]
*  Come on in. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=898.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=899.0s)]
*  You're sitting in that thing. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=900.0s)]
*  You're sitting in that thing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=901.0s)]
*  You're sitting in that thing. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=902.0s)]
*  And if you do that on a regular basis, you get used to it. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=903.0s)]
*  You get used to being uncomfortable. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=906.0s)]
*  But goddamn, you feel good. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=907.0s)]
*  Like your joints feel good. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=909.0s)]
*  All the stiffness kind of feels like it goes away. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=911.0s)]
*  Your mood feels better. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=914.0s)]
*  You sleep better. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=915.0s)]
*  Sauna's the motherfuck. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=917.0s)]
*  If I had to pick one over the two, I don't know which one I'd pick. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=918.0s)]
*  But I love the fact that I could do both of them. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=922.0s)]
*  I think sauna I would pick because there's more data. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=924.0s)]
*  This is a 20-year study out of Finland with sauna patients where they use the sauna four times a week for 20 years. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=928.0s)]
*  And depending on how many times a week they used it, they saw more improvement. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=936.0s)]
*  But the people that used it four times a week saw, I think it was a 40% decrease in all-cause mortality. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=940.0s)]
*  It's a 40% decrease, stroke, heart attack, cancer, for the people that did that as opposed to the people that didn't do it. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=946.0s)]
*  Well, your girl told me that if you do... [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=951.0s)]
*  Rhonda? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=954.0s)]
*  I love her. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=955.0s)]
*  You know I love her. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=956.0s)]
*  I love her too. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=957.0s)]
*  Shout out to Rhonda Patrick. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=958.0s)]
*  I watch every video. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=959.0s)]
*  I take what she tells me to heart. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=960.0s)]
*  And I think she's so fucking sexy. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=962.0s)]
*  She's so fucking smart when she just goes on a tap. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=964.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, she's so fucking sexy. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=968.0s)]
*  But she was saying that 51 minutes a week in the sauna cuts your cardiac arrest rate by fucking 60% or some shit. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=970.0s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what else it does, Joey. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=982.0s)]
*  It makes your cardio better. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=984.0s)]
*  Like your cardio for working out, just sitting there, your heart rate gets jacked. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=986.0s)]
*  So it's like a static form of cardio. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=990.0s)]
*  Before I go to the Tuesday and Thursday Jiu-Jitsu, I go to the red light sauna. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=993.0s)]
*  That's my cheat because that's a heavier class and you got to fucking be a little... [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=997.0s)]
*  So I always go in there in the morning, 34 minutes, come out, go right to Jiu-Jitsu from there. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1002.0s)]
*  It's a good way to warm up before working out too. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1007.0s)]
*  Get in there for 10 minutes. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1010.0s)]
*  Just sort of like get in there and stretch a little bit for 10 minutes. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1012.0s)]
*  I do yoga in there. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1014.0s)]
*  I do a bunch of yoga. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1016.0s)]
*  Whatever the fuck they call it. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1018.0s)]
*  The breathing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a company that makes a yoga room. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1021.0s)]
*  They make a sauna that's just for working out in. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1023.0s)]
*  It's a bigger sauna. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1026.0s)]
*  What is that company? [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1028.0s)]
*  But they have chin-up bars in there and shit and an exercise bike. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1030.0s)]
*  And people work out while they're in the infrared. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1033.0s)]
*  I breathe to five, just work on my breathing. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1036.0s)]
*  Just quick breathing in deep. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1039.0s)]
*  And then I get up and I stretch a little bit. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1041.0s)]
*  And then about the 10 minute mark is where I start doing Chaturangas. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1044.0s)]
*  Which ones are Chaturangas? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1049.0s)]
*  Chaturangas when you go up, down, drop. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1050.0s)]
*  You could drop into a fucking, whatever, crooked dog, whatever the fuck it is. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1054.0s)]
*  But it's not big enough for Uncle Joey and I fucked my ankle up so I wasn't doing those. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1060.0s)]
*  But I'll do a bunch of warrior poses. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1065.0s)]
*  Warrior one, warrior two. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1066.0s)]
*  In the sauna. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1068.0s)]
*  In the sauna. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1069.0s)]
*  And then I wait to the halfway mark. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1070.0s)]
*  I go out, I take 30 seconds, I drink a little liquid IV. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1071.0s)]
*  And I shoot right back the fuck in there. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1074.0s)]
*  And I gotta tell you something else. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1076.0s)]
*  Before I go in that sauna, I do it in the morning. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1077.0s)]
*  I get as fucking jizzled as I can be. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1080.0s)]
*  I don't smoke. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1084.0s)]
*  If I know I'm going to the sauna at 10, I won't do that eight o'clock bong hit. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1085.0s)]
*  I'll hold off on that motherfucker until 10. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1089.0s)]
*  And then I'll do like 18 bong hits. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1093.0s)]
*  When I walk in there, they even know it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1095.0s)]
*  They're the nicest people in the world. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1097.0s)]
*  They just wave. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1099.0s)]
*  I go in the red light sauna. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1100.0s)]
*  I am fucking stoned in there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1102.0s)]
*  When I walk out of there, I dry off. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1105.0s)]
*  I put my socks on. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1107.0s)]
*  I drink my water. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1108.0s)]
*  After about seven minutes, I go back in and smell in there. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1109.0s)]
*  You could grow fucking weed in that motherfucker after. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1112.0s)]
*  The odors you smell in there. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1115.0s)]
*  Fucking fungi toenail sweat. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1117.0s)]
*  Fucking reefer sweat. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1120.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1121.0s)]
*  Is this the place at the gym you go to? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1123.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1124.0s)]
*  This is a place called Chill. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1125.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's a place that's set up just with saunas and cold plungers? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1126.0s)]
*  Red light sauna. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1129.0s)]
*  No cold plunger, but they have the cryo. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1130.0s)]
*  Cryo therapy. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1133.0s)]
*  So you can go right from the sauna to the cryo. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1134.0s)]
*  They got so many things now. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1136.0s)]
*  They got many beds that you sit in. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1137.0s)]
*  It controls like whatever. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1139.0s)]
*  They have so many things. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1141.0s)]
*  The place is clean. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1143.0s)]
*  Six minutes from my house, I could just call them and go, I'm on my way. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1144.0s)]
*  We don't have a bed. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1147.0s)]
*  We have a bed. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1148.0s)]
*  It's tremendous. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1149.0s)]
*  I love all that shit. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1150.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what's better for you, cryo or the cold plunge? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1151.0s)]
*  I think the cold plunge. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1155.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what's harder to do. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1156.0s)]
*  Cold plunge is harder to do. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1157.0s)]
*  Cold plunge is hard. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1158.0s)]
*  It's harder to do. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1159.0s)]
*  And you feel different when you get out of there. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1161.0s)]
*  Like you feel fucking chilled down to the bones. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1163.0s)]
*  Whereas there's something about the cryo chamber. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1167.0s)]
*  I think they're both super beneficial though. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1171.0s)]
*  I don't know if there's been studies done on what's better for you. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1174.0s)]
*  But I get the same feeling after both of them. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1176.0s)]
*  Like, woo, I recover a lot quicker after the cryo therapy than I would after the cold plunge. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1179.0s)]
*  Cold plunge, I'm cold for a long fucking time. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1183.0s)]
*  I only got one regret about cryo therapy. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1185.0s)]
*  I didn't discover that when I was doing drugs. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1187.0s)]
*  Because let me tell you something. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1189.0s)]
*  When you go into the cryo therapy the first time, you do the three minutes. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1191.0s)]
*  When you walk out of there, you either have an idea what this is for you. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1195.0s)]
*  Like for me, when I walked out, I go, where was this motherfucker when I was drinking? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1199.0s)]
*  Because you can snort coke till nine in the morning, go to that red light, turn on the quarter to ten, come out of that ten, and you're brand new. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1204.0s)]
*  I've never done it before. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1210.0s)]
*  But I know from the feeling of walking out of there that you're brand new. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1211.0s)]
*  So you mean the cryo therapy or you mean the sauna? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1217.0s)]
*  The cryo therapy, I'm sorry. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1220.0s)]
*  Japanese people invented cryo therapy. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1222.0s)]
*  They did? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1224.0s)]
*  Can we find out? Can the fact check me? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1225.0s)]
*  I think, I would like to know. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1228.0s)]
*  I mean, I think the Vikings did it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1230.0s)]
*  It was the thing they did to just boost their manliness, just get in the fucking cold water. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1232.0s)]
*  Technically Joey's right. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1239.0s)]
*  Developed in the 1970s by a Japanese rheumatologist, Toshima Yamaguchi. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1241.0s)]
*  But that would be like the actual cryo therapy that we did in LA. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1246.0s)]
*  Like the liquid nitrogen. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1250.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1252.0s)]
*  But the Vikings were doing cold therapy thousands of years ago. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1254.0s)]
*  But the guy that invented this to people, it was Japanese people. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1259.0s)]
*  And again, these motherfuckers like to party. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1264.0s)]
*  So as soon as I walked out of there, that's what I said to myself. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1267.0s)]
*  Absolutely a Japanese guy invented this. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1270.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1273.0s)]
*  It goes back to the ancient civilizations. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1274.0s)]
*  Ancient Egyptians, Romans, and early Greeks were using cold temperatures as a form of therapy as early as 2500 BC. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1276.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1283.0s)]
*  When I used to see Phaidor do it, Phaidor Emelianenko, one of the all time greats, he used to do the banya. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1285.0s)]
*  So they would all get in the sauna together and they would like beat them with leaves. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1292.0s)]
*  They would use leaves and beat them. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1296.0s)]
*  And then they would jump in this frozen lake. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1298.0s)]
*  And I was like, these guys are just insane. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1300.0s)]
*  There's no benefit. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1302.0s)]
*  I'm like, what's the benefit of that? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1303.0s)]
*  I would think it was nonsense. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1304.0s)]
*  But they knew. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1305.0s)]
*  They knew. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1306.0s)]
*  You know, this was early 2000s. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1307.0s)]
*  People weren't doing cold plunges in saunas. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1309.0s)]
*  If they were, it wasn't like openly discussed like it is now. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1312.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1315.0s)]
*  Dan Gable found out about it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1316.0s)]
*  He was telling me on the podcast, he found out about it when he's wrestling the Russians and the Eastern Europeans. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1318.0s)]
*  He's like, they all use sauna. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1323.0s)]
*  And he realized like there's something to the actual benefits for your cardio, recovery, blood cells. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1325.0s)]
*  He said it's almost like a mild version of EPO when you're in the sauna on a regular basis. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1333.0s)]
*  It just really boosts up your endurance. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1338.0s)]
*  Here's Phaidor. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1340.0s)]
*  Damn, when he was young, he was the motherfucker, dude. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1342.0s)]
*  And what a dad bod that guy had. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1346.0s)]
*  There's not a single photo of him out there with a six pack. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1349.0s)]
*  And he's widely regarded as the greatest heavyweight of all time. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1352.0s)]
*  I mean, he might be the greatest martial artist of all time. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1357.0s)]
*  He's certainly in the argument. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1359.0s)]
*  The arguments for the greatest martial arts of all time, in their prime. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1362.0s)]
*  I always say this guy, because people leave him out of the conversation, you never should. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1367.0s)]
*  BJ Penn. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1371.0s)]
*  BJ Penn in his prime was one of the greatest I've ever seen. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1372.0s)]
*  And then there's Anderson. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1377.0s)]
*  Anderson in his prime. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1378.0s)]
*  I was just watching the Anderson documentary that the UFC just put together. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1379.0s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1383.0s)]
*  You forget. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1384.0s)]
*  You forget. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1385.0s)]
*  You forget those Rich Franklin fights. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1386.0s)]
*  I never forgot. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1388.0s)]
*  You forget. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1389.0s)]
*  But you forget the level of expertise and precision and just mastery he had when he was in his prime. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1390.0s)]
*  I am telling you, I'm guilty. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1399.0s)]
*  Even though I'm a giant Anderson fan, I had to see it again. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1401.0s)]
*  I had to see it again. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1404.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh yeah, people forgot. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1405.0s)]
*  Well, we had a conversation after the Alessandro fight. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1406.0s)]
*  You're like, Alessandro's the best. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1407.0s)]
*  I go, remember I said to you, bro, relax. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1408.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, you're right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1409.0s)]
*  It's Anderson. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1410.0s)]
*  And I love the Rich Franklin fight. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1411.0s)]
*  I mean, the first time I ever saw this motherfucker, I'm getting dressed. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1412.0s)]
*  I'm getting dressed. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1413.0s)]
*  Ready to go do comedy with you or anybody else. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1414.0s)]
*  And it was a UFC fight night for him against Chris Levin. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1415.0s)]
*  I never saw this fucking guy. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1416.0s)]
*  I heard you guys talking about him. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1417.0s)]
*  And when he came out, it was fucking crazy. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1418.0s)]

*  I'm going to go to the gym. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1443.0s)]
*  Because I became a fan of Anderson's in Pride, and then Anderson went over to Cage Warriors. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1444.0s)]
*  And when he went over to the... [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1450.56s)]
*  Was it Cage Rage? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1451.56s)]
*  What was the organization that he fought for, that Anderson fought for in England? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1453.84s)]
*  But in England, he became Anderson Silva. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1457.68s)]
*  You know, there's like Charles Olivera. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1460.76s)]
*  Charles Olivera was a really good fighter, and then his daughter was born, and then he [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1463.4s)]
*  became Charles Olivera, the assassin that everybody knows. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1467.76s)]
*  He lost a bunch of times in the UFC. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1472.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1474.72s)]
*  He would fall apart. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1475.72s)]
*  Anderson when he went to England. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1478.0s)]
*  There's something about leaving Japan and going to England, then he became Anderson. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1479.0s)]
*  So what was the... [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1484.14s)]
*  Cage Rage, right. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1485.14s)]
*  Cage Warriors is the... [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1486.8400000000001s)]
*  That's like the top organization that exists now in the UK. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1488.52s)]
*  So he fights Lee Murray in Cage Rage, and Lee Murray was a fucking killer. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1493.4s)]
*  Lee Murray was the guy who was involved in the biggest armed robbery in the history of [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1500.0s)]
*  the UK. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1503.92s)]
*  He's in jail now, like forever. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1504.92s)]
*  Oh, I've heard about him. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1506.92s)]
*  I've never seen him. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1507.92s)]
*  A real gangster. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1508.92s)]
*  A crazy dude. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1509.92s)]
*  So he fucks Lee Murray up in Cage Rage, and then he comes back and fucks Jorge Rivera [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1511.24s)]
*  up in Cage Rage. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1516.08s)]
*  And when he fucked Jorge Rivera up, he's standing in front of Jorge, who was a murderous puncher, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1517.08s)]
*  and letting Jorge punch him in the face. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1522.0s)]
*  He was just letting him punch him in the face. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1523.84s)]
*  Just like, but you ain't got shit. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1525.76s)]
*  And then beat his ass. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1528.28s)]
*  And then he goes over and fights Tony Fricklin in Cage Rage and hits him with that crazy [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1529.8000000000002s)]
*  upward elbow. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1533.76s)]
*  Did you ever see that? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1534.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1535.76s)]
*  So he fucked Curtis Stout, fucked him up, fucked Tony Fricklin up. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1536.76s)]
*  And then by the time he was coming to the UFC, I was like, dude, get ready for this [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1540.2s)]
*  guy. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  And I was looking at the line, like the betting line. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1547.5600000000002s)]
*  The betting lines back then were stealing. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1549.92s)]
*  Nobody knew nothing. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1553.3200000000002s)]
*  Nobody knew nothing. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  Nobody knew nothing. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1555.3200000000002s)]
*  A guy would sneak over, a guy like Glover Teixeira or someone would come over from Brazil [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1557.0s)]
*  and you'd be like, no one even knows yet. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1561.6799999999998s)]
*  You don't even know how good this guy is. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1564.76s)]
*  Again, the line would be in favor of the other guy, like, oh my god, this is hilarious. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1566.76s)]
*  I think Chris Liebman might have been a slight favorite over Anderson. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1572.2s)]
*  I don't even know what the betting line was. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1575.0s)]
*  I don't think he was a favorite. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1576.8s)]
*  I think Anderson was a favorite. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1577.8s)]
*  But either way, I was like, dude, he's going to light him up like a Christmas tree. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1578.8s)]
*  Because Chris Liebman was just such a murderous, marauding, attacking style. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1583.3999999999999s)]
*  That's perfect for Anderson because Anderson's the technician. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1589.24s)]
*  So he's just going to slide away. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1592.52s)]
*  Pop, pop, pop. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1593.52s)]
*  That's what he did. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1594.52s)]
*  He basically just stepped away, punched. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1595.52s)]
*  It's a master class. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1597.3999999999999s)]
*  Put that fight on. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1598.6399999999999s)]
*  Put Anderson Silver versus Chris Liebman. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1599.6399999999999s)]
*  The fucking fight you took me to with Rich Franklin in Columbus, when the Arnold thing [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  was going on and we were in Columbus. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1605.9199999999998s)]
*  Last array, when he boom boom, then he hits him low with a leg kick and then he punches [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1608.78s)]
*  him again, another leg kick. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1613.78s)]
*  It's fucking beautiful. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1615.46s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1616.46s)]
*  That's how you mix it the fuck up. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1617.98s)]
*  And he did it like he was just playing. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1619.54s)]
*  He did it like he was hitting a heavy bag, just fucking around. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1622.02s)]
*  What about the night we did the hit acid and that's the night he decided to kick that dude [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1625.6599999999999s)]
*  in the face? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1629.3s)]
*  Yeah, this is the one. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1630.3s)]
*  So this is Anderson's debut. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1631.6999999999998s)]
*  By the way, Chris Liebman, one of the most murderous punchers, knocked out Vanderlei [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1633.4599999999998s)]
*  Silva, knocked out a shit ton of dudes. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1639.02s)]
*  When Chris Liebman would connect on guys, they would go night night and he fought like [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1641.54s)]
*  a fucking Wolverine, man. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1645.4199999999998s)]
*  Chris Liebman would just charge at you. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1648.4199999999998s)]
*  So like that style with that kind of confidence is perfect. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  Look at how Anderson's moving, baby. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1654.78s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1656.58s)]
*  Look at that jab. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1657.58s)]
*  Look at that jab. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1658.6599999999999s)]
*  Shucks him off to the side. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the footwork, bro. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1660.9s)]
*  Look how elegant. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1663.5800000000002s)]
*  Just no wasted movement. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1665.9s)]
*  And Liebman just moving in for the kill. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1669.8600000000001s)]
*  Pink. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1672.14s)]
*  Uh oh. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1673.14s)]
*  Give me that volume. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1674.14s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1675.14s)]
*  It's already beginning. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1681.14s)]
*  Pink, pink, pink. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1682.14s)]
*  Yep. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1683.14s)]
*  I mean, Liebman can't even land a shot on him. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1684.14s)]
*  And Liebman got back up. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1691.66s)]
*  Oh, Liebman's so tough, dude. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1692.66s)]
*  Tough as nails. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1694.74s)]
*  And there's the knee. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1695.74s)]
*  And that's a wrap, son. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1696.74s)]
*  Anderson Silva. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1707.74s)]
*  That was the big debut. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1710.3400000000001s)]
*  That was like 2004? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1711.3400000000001s)]
*  2006. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1712.3400000000001s)]
*  2006. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1713.3400000000001s)]
*  I was fucking hypnotized by that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1714.3400000000001s)]
*  Hypnotized. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1716.98s)]
*  He was the man. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1717.98s)]
*  Hypnotized. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1718.98s)]
*  He was the man. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1720.3s)]
*  He was the man. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1721.3s)]
*  Listen, bro. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1722.3s)]
*  I watched the UFC with you. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1723.3s)]
*  There was a bunch of chubby guys that looked like me. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1724.3s)]

*  in the mornings with the hoods on. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1906.78s)]
*  They wear the hoods to keep the heat on and then have the vodka there. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1909.78s)]
*  I did this because I was so heavy, I was embarrassed to go any other time of the day. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1913.78s)]
*  I would go at 445 and I would sit in the fucking banya with them, whatever, the steam bath. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1918.78s)]
*  Then I would go on the other one, the sauna, the steam bath, and then I would swim. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1924.78s)]
*  I just swam more and more every day. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1928.78s)]
*  This went on for about six months. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1931.78s)]
*  One day I get there about 5 a.m. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1933.78s)]

*  Balls ass naked, just on a fucking towel. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1942.78s)]
*  Dick out, didn't give a Frenchman's fuck. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1946.78s)]
*  I sat there for about five minutes and all I kept thinking was, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1949.78s)]
*  these Russians ain't going to like it when they come in here. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1952.78s)]
*  Sure enough, the fucking three Russians came in. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1955.78s)]
*  They asked the guy to move. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1958.78s)]
*  The dude didn't fucking move and it was not good after that. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1960.78s)]
*  Right in the YMCA. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1963.78s)]
*  They beat his ass? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1965.78s)]
*  They fucking choked him and threw him out naked. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1966.78s)]
*  They picked him up by his fucking neck right in front of me. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1968.78s)]
*  I just kept walking. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1971.78s)]

*  Dog, I can't be around that shit. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1973.78s)]
*  I'll go to jail for 20 years. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1974.78s)]
*  Joe, they grabbed him by the fucking throat. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1976.78s)]
*  They asked him one time, can we sit here? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1978.78s)]
*  Then he let him sit, but he wouldn't put a towel on. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1980.78s)]
*  That's what it was. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1982.78s)]
*  The guy had probably come from a fucking freaky spot and was trying to get his dicks up in there. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1984.78s)]
*  I walked out and all I heard was a couple of trumps. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=1989.78s)]

*  There's just loads everywhere. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2035.78s)]
*  These guys are just fucking each other everywhere. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2037.78s)]
*  They find places to fuck and they would go there to look for other buff guys to fuck. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2039.78s)]
*  Imagine the problem with guys is there's no women. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2045.78s)]
*  There's no one to go, hey, this is ridiculous. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2050.7799999999997s)]

*  What have you been up to? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2053.78s)]
*  Are we going to use protection? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2054.78s)]
*  There's no voice of reason. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2055.78s)]
*  It's just two guys, you want to fuck? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2057.78s)]

*  Let's fuck. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2059.78s)]
*  And they're all jacked up, right? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2060.78s)]
*  So they're probably doing testosterone or they're lifting a lot of weights and they've got high testosterone. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2062.78s)]
*  They're horny all the time. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2067.78s)]
*  They're taking drugs and they're just fucking each other at the gym. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2068.78s)]
*  He said the gym was barely a gym. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2071.78s)]
*  He goes, it's so weird to come here and it's a gym. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2073.78s)]
*  He goes, that gym was just a front for a gay pickup spot. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2076.78s)]
*  These guys were just, I'm sure they were working out too, but they were just banging. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2080.78s)]
*  They were doing a lot of banging. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2084.78s)]
*  Listen, bro, when you go through Boys Town, I think you had a bit about it before we left LA. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2085.78s)]
*  People have to understand that when you go through Boys Town, you have one at the end. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2090.78s)]
*  By the time you hit Dentonis and you're about to hit, you have two things on your mind either. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2095.78s)]

*  They're out of control. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2104.78s)]
*  And in my world, I love these motherfuckers. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2105.78s)]

*  Fucking, we've had a light. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2121.78s)]
*  There's a bar on the right-hand side. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2123.78s)]
*  UFC is on. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2125.78s)]

*  And me and my wife just look at each other and go, God bless them. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2142.78s)]
*  God bless. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2145.78s)]
*  That's what it is about Boys Town. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2146.78s)]
*  They got the run of it. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2148.78s)]
*  Well, they also don't have to pretend. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2150.78s)]
*  No. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2152.78s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2153.78s)]
*  They don't have to pretend they want something other than what they want. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2154.78s)]
*  Whereas like there's a lot of men that they feel like to pick up women in a bar. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2156.78s)]
*  They have to pretend to be something different. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2160.78s)]
*  They have to act a little different. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2162.78s)]
*  They have to play to what the lady likes. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2164.78s)]

*  And I'm like, really? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2208.78s)]
*  I'll tell you, I went in there maybe for three or four months before I signed up at the Y. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2209.78s)]
*  Because the Y told me you're too fat. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2214.78s)]
*  We can't have you here. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2215.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2216.78s)]
*  The first time I went to the Y. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2217.78s)]
*  The Y told you you're too fat to work out? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2218.78s)]
*  Dog. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2220.78s)]
*  When I went to the Y the first time, I signed up for a consultant thing, like somebody for [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2221.78s)]
*  free to help with you. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2225.78s)]
*  I didn't want to come to you guys. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2227.78s)]
*  I was too embarrassed. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2228.78s)]
*  I thought I was going to die. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2229.78s)]
*  I got on a fucking treadmill. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2230.78s)]
*  I didn't even make 30 seconds on level two. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2233.78s)]
*  And he goes, listen, you got to go out and walk. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2236.78s)]
*  He goes, come back here when you lose 50 pounds. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2239.78s)]
*  He goes, right now you got to walk. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2243.78s)]
*  Do you ever walk? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2245.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2247.78s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, to the store, to the drug dealers, to the comedy store. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2248.78s)]
*  Yeah, but no. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2253.78s)]
*  And he goes, just walk. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2254.78s)]
*  He goes, I want you to do what Dolce does, with the tap the mailboxes. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2255.78s)]
*  Go for a walk and tap two mailboxes one day and then three the next. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2259.78s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2263.78s)]
*  As far as you go. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2264.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2265.78s)]
*  So Christie gave me that thing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2266.78s)]
*  And I would go over there at night. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2267.78s)]
*  I knew little things from lifting as a kid. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2268.78s)]
*  But every time I was struggling over there, some fucking hot guy came over. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2272.78s)]
*  And he would always go, excuse me, can I help you out? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2276.78s)]
*  And he would talk to me. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2279.78s)]
*  And yeah, maybe they wanted to fuck me. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2280.78s)]
*  But I doubt it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2282.78s)]
*  I was 418 pounds. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2283.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2284.78s)]
*  You had to fucking get a fucking crowbar to get to my asshole at that point. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2285.78s)]
*  So I mean, these guys were fucking dying in my jaw. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2289.78s)]
*  I would love to sit here and tell you that they hit on me, not one time. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2292.78s)]
*  In fact, they were very helpful. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2295.78s)]
*  Would they hit on me? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2297.78s)]
*  They would set me up. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2298.78s)]
*  You know, they're wolves. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2299.78s)]
*  Don't ever think. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2303.78s)]
*  And that's what shocked us. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2304.78s)]
*  Like my friend told me about that website he used to go on, Boys Ahoy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2305.78s)]
*  That was just gay men. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2310.78s)]
*  Boys Ahoy? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2311.78s)]

*  What a great name for a website. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2316.78s)]
*  Okay, now he had belonged to other ones. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2317.78s)]
*  Grindr, you know, he's a gay dude. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2319.78s)]
*  He'd tell me all this shit. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2321.78s)]
*  He said when he signed up for Boys Ahoy, it was a complete different situation. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2323.78s)]

*  They just want to fuck. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2329.78s)]
*  There's no female equivalent. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2330.78s)]
*  No, there's no way. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2332.78s)]
*  They met at the... [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2333.78s)]

*  I get there, everybody's cool. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2409.78s)]
*  But there's two old school gay dudes. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2411.78s)]
*  They're probably in their 60s. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2415.78s)]
*  And they're those old school New York geezers, gay guys. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2417.78s)]
*  They were gay when it was tough to be gay. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2420.78s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2422.78s)]
*  Like they've been in New York all their lives. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2424.78s)]
*  They started at CBGBs or the meat market or whatever fucking gay haunt. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2426.78s)]
*  And now they're mature. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2430.78s)]
*  They were married before the law. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2432.78s)]
*  These motherfuckers were miserable. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2434.78s)]
*  They just sat there and every once in a while they would look at each other [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2436.78s)]
*  and look at the kids and go. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2439.78s)]
*  The whole fucking night. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2442.78s)]
*  I'm like, why are these fucking guys here? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2443.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, I got a girl and a little boy, a Jewish kid, jumping up and down, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2445.78s)]
*  singing into the phone, the whole fucking thing. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2450.78s)]
*  And I'm like, look at this fucking Jewish kid. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2452.78s)]
*  His brother's fighting over there in Israel. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2454.78s)]
*  He's over here watching this fucking thing, jumping up and down like a half a fucking fag. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2456.78s)]
*  Now the two gay guys haven't said a word. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2460.78s)]
*  They just keep looking around, hating, hating everybody. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2463.78s)]
*  Dog, when they said Cher coming out to the stage, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2467.78s)]
*  these motherfuckers fucked it out of their capes. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2469.78s)]
*  And they got up and they were dancing like the kids. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2472.78s)]
*  You should have seen them. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2474.78s)]
*  They had to be in there, 67, 68. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2475.78s)]
*  They both had their hair. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2478.78s)]
*  They were fucking dead. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2480.78s)]
*  They were hugging each other. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2481.78s)]
*  Take me home. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2482.78s)]
*  Whatever that song she fucking sings. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2483.78s)]
*  When Cher walked out, these motherfuckers, you see like 10,000 people just left. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2485.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2490.78s)]
*  Because there was a lot of gay people hidden. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2491.78s)]
*  It's Christmas time. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2493.78s)]
*  They want to be out jumping up. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2494.78s)]

*  It's hard to say. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2563.78s)]
*  Often too, she might be singing live, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=2564.78s)]

*  We went to Vegas a while back during the pandemic. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3177.94s)]
*  Whitney had a corporate gig. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3180.98s)]
*  So it was like, she did stand up at some lady's house. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3182.8999999999996s)]

*  We just went from Andrew Schulz's wedding. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3196.88s)]
*  So we went to Andrew Schulz's wedding in Montecito. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3199.4s)]

*  Whitney and my wife, we all went to Vegas for like the day. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3205.76s)]
*  So we got there at like 9 p.m. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3210.84s)]
*  The gig is at 10. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3213.28s)]
*  She does her gig and then we go out and we go and play cards. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3215.0s)]
*  And it was a hilarious night. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3218.28s)]
*  Lex Friedman got a push-up contest with David Goggins. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3221.32s)]
*  I called Goggins and said we were in town. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3224.6s)]

*  But I'm not good at it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3230.88s)]
*  Did you ever play poker with five guys? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3232.36s)]
*  Nope. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3234.52s)]
*  Nope. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3235.52s)]
*  Poker to me was always the thing that killed pool action. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3236.52s)]
*  Because you can't miss when you're playing poker. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3239.2s)]
*  You can win or lose if you're a gambling addict. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3241.2s)]
*  There's a lot of guys. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3243.28s)]
*  The thing about pool is making the shot. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like the nine balls, it's like it's eight to eight on a race to nine. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3247.6400000000003s)]
*  You're shooting the nine ball for all the fucking marbles. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3252.2000000000003s)]
*  That's what I like. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3256.92s)]
*  I like these high pressure moments. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3258.1200000000003s)]
*  I like the difficulty of like performing under pressure. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3260.36s)]
*  And cards didn't have any of that. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3265.96s)]
*  But it had the gambling. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3268.0800000000004s)]
*  So all the gambling addicts were just addicted to gambling. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3269.32s)]
*  They didn't want to play pool anymore. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3272.1600000000003s)]
*  They wanted to play cards. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3273.88s)]
*  So we'd have these gin games, gin rummy games. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3275.32s)]
*  These guys would be playing all these card games when you couldn't get any pool games. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3278.28s)]
*  So to me I was like, this is not good. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3282.96s)]
*  I don't like this. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3284.2000000000003s)]
*  I can never sit with five guys all night. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3285.2000000000003s)]
*  I knew people would play two, three days. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3287.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3289.76s)]
*  I can't do that. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3290.76s)]
*  I'm not a game guy. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3291.76s)]
*  Even Monopoly as a kid, once you started buying hotels, I'm done. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3293.28s)]
*  Poker is a very skillful game and I'm sure I would love it. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3296.84s)]
*  It's just like golf to me. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3299.88s)]
*  My friend's husband, he plays professionally. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3303.64s)]
*  He plays poker. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3305.88s)]
*  He lives out here. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3306.88s)]
*  And he goes everywhere. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3307.88s)]
*  He goes to these tournaments. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3308.88s)]
*  There's these card places. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3309.88s)]
*  There's one out in Round Rock that's this big fucking card place. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3311.24s)]
*  And high level guys go there and they play and they play tournaments. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3316.04s)]
*  And he makes money. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3319.36s)]
*  Like he's a real poker player. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3320.36s)]
*  Ari was a real poker player. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3322.56s)]
*  Ari lived in LA. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3323.8399999999997s)]
*  He played a lot of real poker. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3325.36s)]
*  But to me, you know how I am. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3327.4s)]
*  I can't get into another thing. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3329.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm too crazy. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3331.72s)]
*  I get into another thing. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3332.9599999999996s)]
*  I'm playing. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3333.9599999999996s)]
*  I got into archery. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3334.9599999999996s)]

*  The only reason I can't do it more is my shoulder gives out. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3336.9599999999996s)]
*  I get tired. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3339.72s)]
*  Otherwise, I'd be there all day. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3340.72s)]
*  I'm a psychopath. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3341.72s)]
*  And if you give me something like poker, where all I have to do is sit there and do this [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3342.72s)]
*  and I get better at it and figure it out, I'll be doing that 12 hours a day. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3346.64s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3350.56s)]
*  I'm too crazy. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3351.56s)]
*  I don't have time for that either. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3352.56s)]
*  I don't have time. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3353.56s)]
*  I don't even know how to play dice. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3354.56s)]
*  Like street dice on the street. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3357.0s)]
*  I walked my games all the fucking time as a kid. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3358.3599999999997s)]
*  I'd stop for two minutes and say hello, but I didn't play. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3361.52s)]
*  There was a 30% chance that someone was going to get punched or shot if there was ever a [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3364.96s)]
*  dice game. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3368.36s)]
*  There's a 30% chance. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3369.36s)]
*  I always thought that was like, this is like a high level of potential violent activity [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3371.32s)]
*  because people get mad. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3377.0s)]
*  They lose. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3378.0s)]
*  They think someone's cheating. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3379.0s)]
*  Someone's got loaded dice. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3380.0s)]
*  Someone says they bet this, but they didn't bet this. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3381.48s)]
*  They bet that. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3383.4s)]

*  And then we all went to a hotel and snorted coke until the next day. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3433.36s)]
*  So how do they get away with that? [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3436.4s)]
*  Do they make a deal with the cops? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3437.4s)]
*  They pay the cops off? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3438.84s)]

*  Probably. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3440.84s)]
*  Probably. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3441.84s)]
*  Get everybody to keep their mouth shut? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3442.84s)]
*  You can't get everybody to keep their mouth shut. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3443.84s)]
*  This is 30 years ago. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3444.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3445.84s)]
*  Different mindset. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3447.4s)]

*  But I don't know how they do it. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3456.88s)]
*  They figure it out. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3458.2400000000002s)]
*  You have to pay the battalion chief. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3460.08s)]
*  You gotta pay somebody. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3464.52s)]
*  You gotta pay them good money. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3465.52s)]
*  You gotta give them a piece so they have an invested interest in keeping the place open. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3466.52s)]
*  I knew people who had that, but they'd have moving locations every day so the cops could [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  never get a hold of you. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  When you book numbers on the phone, we had to get a new apartment every three weeks. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3477.52s)]
*  Not a personal apartment. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3484.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3485.6s)]
*  To book out of. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3486.6s)]
*  To book out of. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3487.6s)]
*  So I would get a, my mom would get an apartment and then she would get three different apartments [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3488.6s)]
*  out of that apartment so nobody could read what you're doing. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3492.8399999999997s)]
*  Then a month later, next door. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3496.16s)]
*  Then a month later, around the block. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3497.72s)]
*  Then you're back to that fucking building. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3499.44s)]
*  So you pretty much pay rent on it. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3501.2s)]
*  All those years rent was cheap. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3503.48s)]
*  Now you get fucking. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3505.7999999999997s)]
*  Isn't it crazy how much underground gambling there was with bookies and the numbers? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3506.7999999999997s)]
*  The numbers was a big one. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3512.12s)]
*  Numbers was big. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3513.72s)]
*  You know, underground casinos. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3514.72s)]
*  I used to go with my buddy Martin Perez to this judo school. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3516.4399999999996s)]
*  I never wanted to go. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3520.3999999999996s)]
*  I was more of a karate guy. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3521.6s)]
*  But I would go with him. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3524.0s)]
*  And there was like this old fucking Japanese guy and this old Cuban dude and they would [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3525.0s)]
*  throw each other around. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3529.2s)]
*  There was a Russian guy there. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3530.2s)]
*  This is the 70s. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3531.88s)]
*  And up the corner there was a place where people would play cards. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3533.44s)]
*  And I found out my stepfather would go there. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3536.76s)]
*  And one day I went to judo on the way out. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3539.48s)]
*  As I was walking towards the bus on 7th Street I saw unmarked cards. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3542.2000000000003s)]
*  I saw like two unmarked cards. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3546.0s)]
*  And when I got home that night, my stepdad was getting ready. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3548.84s)]
*  He goes, where you going? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3552.04s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to play cards. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3553.04s)]
*  And I go, you going on the 8th Street? [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3554.04s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3555.04s)]
*  I go, don't go down there. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3556.04s)]
*  He goes, why? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3557.04s)]
*  I go, because I was down there with Martin and I saw the fucking two unmarked cards [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3558.04s)]
*  down there. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3561.84s)]
*  And he goes, what the fuck do you know? [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3562.84s)]
*  I go, what do I know that since I've been fucking five I've been wanting to be a lookout. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3563.84s)]
*  He says, I'm five. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3569.0s)]
*  That's my job, to look, to keep my fucking eyes open. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  And I would just pick up shit like that. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3574.08s)]
*  I would just pick up two unmarked cards. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3575.8s)]
*  He didn't go. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3578.4s)]
*  He thought about it. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3579.44s)]
*  And he goes, okay, if you saw him I won't go. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3580.44s)]
*  Sure enough the next day I woke up he gave me 50 bucks. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3582.36s)]
*  He's like, dog, how the fuck did you know? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3585.76s)]
*  Because I'm telling you. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3587.48s)]
*  I fucking know. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3588.48s)]
*  They got raided? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3590.52s)]
*  I know in those days. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3592.2s)]
*  The cops would go early and they'd park like two blocks away because they're fucking lazy. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3593.2s)]
*  You know, if you're going to raid somebody, stay the fuck away from there all goddamn [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3597.8s)]
*  day. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3600.84s)]
*  Then come in at night. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3601.84s)]
*  Don't fucking lurk all day. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3602.84s)]
*  We know. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3603.84s)]
*  Second good fellows, they were following them all fucking day with a helicopter. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3604.84s)]
*  Just bust them, cocksucker. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3607.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3608.88s)]
*  Well, they want to terrorize you before they get you. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3609.88s)]
*  Well, they want to see what, they want to see how you respond. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3611.84s)]
*  Well, if you're cracked out, you're going to go to try to get rid of something. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3615.12s)]
*  Or you're going to go to try to hide something. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3618.72s)]
*  And they got your phone tapped. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3621.0800000000004s)]
*  They got everything. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3622.0800000000004s)]
*  So they put a cop car in front of your house to see where you react, to see how your reaction [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3623.0800000000004s)]
*  would be for the day. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3627.44s)]
*  And then you start cleaning the house. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3629.0s)]
*  You know, you call people, get everything out of your house, whatever the fuck it is. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3631.1600000000003s)]
*  And then they come in and you know. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3634.44s)]
*  But it's a different world out there now. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3637.1600000000003s)]
*  So I don't know nothing about that fucking world now. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3638.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a different world. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3641.36s)]
*  And I don't want to know. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3642.36s)]
*  Because now they'll shoot you just for being there. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3643.36s)]
*  That is, you know. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3646.92s)]
*  It's a different world in terms of law enforcement, too. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3647.92s)]
*  People getting out of jail like that now. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3650.8s)]
*  And they still won't drop my warrant and fuck in Seattle. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3653.2000000000003s)]
*  You can't even get arrested in Seattle for what you did. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3657.1600000000003s)]
*  You wouldn't even have a record. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3659.84s)]
*  You cannot. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3660.84s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3661.84s)]
*  You could hit somebody with a stick and be out that afternoon. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3662.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3665.48s)]
*  You wouldn't have a record in Seattle. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3666.48s)]
*  I'm still going back and forth with these motherfuckers. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3667.48s)]
*  That's why I looked before. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3669.48s)]
*  So you still can't get your passport? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3670.48s)]
*  No. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3673.48s)]
*  I just sent them the last thing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3674.6s)]
*  If you get a passport and we go overseas, when we do gigs overseas, you will get a passport. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3676.6s)]
*  We will do this. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3680.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3681.6s)]
*  When you do this, we're going to have to fucking fly in a day early. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3682.6s)]
*  We're going to make it so. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3684.6s)]
*  Because I don't know if you're even going to be able to get in over there. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3685.6s)]
*  It might be a hard time once you land. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3688.6s)]
*  Where? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3690.6s)]
*  Anywhere. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3691.6s)]
*  UK, anywhere. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3692.6s)]
*  Dog. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3693.6s)]
*  Canada is a big one. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3694.6s)]
*  Canada is not going to take me. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3695.6s)]
*  We're not going to go to Canada. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3696.6s)]
*  And I love Canadians. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3697.6s)]
*  I got nothing against Canadians. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3698.6s)]
*  But it's the way the country works. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3699.6s)]
*  The nicest guy we know has got a DUI and he can't get into Canada. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3701.52s)]
*  But you can pay a tax. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3705.52s)]
*  Like Snoop Dogg. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3708.52s)]
*  So you're telling me Snoop Dogg can't play Canada? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3710.52s)]
*  There's a tax you can pay. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3712.52s)]
*  A little heavy and then you get out. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3714.52s)]
*  It's like everybody else. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3716.52s)]
*  We could all settle this with an envelope. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3717.52s)]
*  Well, they get an envelope anyway. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3719.52s)]
*  When you do a gig in Canada, they get a big tax envelope. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3721.52s)]
*  You get that in the UK too. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3724.52s)]
*  You do a gig in the UK, you're paying. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3726.52s)]
*  Let me tell you something. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3728.52s)]
*  Before 9-11, I was going up to Toronto two times a year. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3731.04s)]
*  I had all these criminal charges, no warrants or anything. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3734.04s)]
*  My friend from the Miami Improv dated a girl from Buffalo. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3739.04s)]
*  And he called her father to pick me up at the Buffalo Airport, take me to his house [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3744.04s)]
*  and then cross me over the border. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3749.04s)]
*  Before 9-11, there was a casino they'd go to. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3751.04s)]
*  And you just drove in. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3754.04s)]
*  There was no ID, no nothing. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3755.04s)]
*  And he would drive me to Toronto. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3758.04s)]
*  He would drive me to Ontario. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3760.56s)]
*  And I'd take the bus to Toronto and do the two weeks and then come back. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3762.56s)]
*  But on the way back, I would come on the bus. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3765.56s)]
*  I would drive those motherfuckers crazy, dog. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3768.56s)]
*  When I'd give them my license, they'd start looking at me and they'd go, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3771.56s)]
*  when did you come in here? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3775.56s)]
*  And I'd go, last week. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3776.56s)]
*  You were the guy that was working. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3777.56s)]
*  They would say, no, I wasn't. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3779.56s)]
*  I would have never let you come through. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3781.56s)]
*  Well, you let me the fuck out now. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3783.56s)]
*  Because of your record? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3785.56s)]
*  Yeah, they would hold me for like 10 minutes. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3786.56s)]
*  How did you get into this country? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3789.08s)]
*  I'm like, on fucking bus? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3791.08s)]
*  You guys let me in last week? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3792.08s)]
*  No, it was a mistake. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3794.08s)]
*  We could have never let you in. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3796.08s)]
*  Dog, I would fuck with them all the time. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3797.08s)]
*  I tried to do that cute shit during 9-11. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3799.08s)]
*  They yanked me right the fuck out of it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3802.08s)]
*  We're not taking this shit. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3804.08s)]
*  But to answer your question from before, my plan is this. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3806.08s)]
*  I'm doing 10 spots. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3809.08s)]
*  OK, I'm up to number three. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3811.08s)]
*  When I do my 10 spots, I'm going to decide what I want to do. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3813.08s)]
*  I'm not going to travel no more. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3816.6s)]
*  I'm not going to get on fucking planes. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3818.6s)]
*  That was brutal last night. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3820.6s)]
*  That was brutal. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3822.6s)]
*  Three and a half hours on a flight for me, I can't do that. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3823.6s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3825.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3826.6s)]
*  I'm good for like an hour and a half. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3827.6s)]
*  I went to Nashville on JSX, the private plane, the semi-private, 30 people on. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3828.6s)]
*  Tremendous. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3832.6s)]
*  I recommend that to anybody if you don't like terminals. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3833.6s)]
*  I fucking loved it. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3836.6s)]
*  But they don't fly to Austin yet. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3837.6s)]
*  They fly to Dallas, and you have to connect to Austin. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3839.6s)]
*  My plan is this. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3841.6s)]
*  Start doing some sets at the stand. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3842.6s)]
*  Start going over and seeing Chris Mazzulli at the Gotham Comedy Club. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3845.12s)]
*  Do a couple of those. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3849.12s)]
*  And when I feel like I got 45 minutes, I'm going to take a residency somewhere. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3851.12s)]
*  Where do you think you're going to go? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3855.12s)]
*  AC or Parks Casino. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3857.12s)]

*  Nobody will get their feelings hurt. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3875.64s)]
*  If I say a joke that I'm on the spectrum, somebody's not going to cry after the show [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3877.64s)]
*  and say that their nephew's on the spectrum and the show hurt their feelings, really that's [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3884.64s)]

*  Listen, we're not fucking crazy here. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3921.8s)]

*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3929.64s)]

*  Jersey's expensive. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3933.64s)]
*  And that's why everybody from Jersey flies to fucking Florida. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3934.64s)]
*  I like to lean towards Nashville. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3939.64s)]
*  Nashville's nice. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3941.64s)]

*  The ones I saw over the holidays, brand new. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3949.48s)]

*  Because it's going to be just a spare house. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3954.56s)]
*  It's just a property to retire in. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3957.0s)]
*  If I turn 65, you know how much money I'll save by having a Tennessee address? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=3959.24s)]

*  It says there's arrivals of migrants without prior authorization, which I guess that technically, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4187.74s)]

*  Let's say if it's... [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4323.0199999999995s)]
*  Go back to that. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4324.0599999999995s)]
*  It's past 10,000. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4325.46s)]
*  It said it passed 10,000 thrice. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4326.46s)]
*  So let's just say it's 50,000. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4330.18s)]
*  So 10,000 a day. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4332.5s)]

*  But think about it. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4360.34s)]
*  How am I supposed to feel? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4361.34s)]
*  I'm an immigrant. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4362.34s)]

*  I would do it. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4367.900000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4388.7s)]

*  Why do we come out here to be homeless? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4393.7s)]
*  They're sanctuary cities? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4394.7s)]
*  Now, I don't even know. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4395.7s)]

*  Whoever made that didn't check with the people. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4400.7s)]
*  No. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4402.7s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4403.7s)]
*  Like, whoever said we're a sanctuary city in New York City didn't check with the people [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4404.7s)]
*  in the community. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4408.58s)]
*  Well, you know what it is. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4409.58s)]
*  It's just letting everybody know you're not racist. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4410.58s)]
*  You're not racist. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4412.86s)]
*  You have no problem with immigrants. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4413.86s)]
*  Well, we're not racist. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4414.86s)]
*  We're not, of course. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4415.86s)]
*  We're not racist. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4416.86s)]
*  But I see that my friend who's got two children that depends on overtime from the sanitation [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4417.86s)]
*  department can't get it. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4424.339999999999s)]
*  He's a supervisor. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4425.9s)]

*  Because it's all going to this… [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4429.339999999999s)]
*  To the migrant thing. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4431.179999999999s)]
*  And cops. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4432.179999999999s)]
*  No overtime. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4433.179999999999s)]
*  You know. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4434.179999999999s)]
*  So this is what this is doing. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4435.179999999999s)]
*  And this just isn't New York. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4436.54s)]
*  It's got to be in all the big cities. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4437.54s)]
*  Chicago has a big problem with it. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4439.94s)]
*  Texas, Houston, you know. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4441.54s)]
*  And what comes from this? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4443.46s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4444.46s)]
*  Again, we're going back to the Marielle thing. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4445.46s)]
*  I don't know who the fuck is coming in. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4447.78s)]
*  I don't know if they raped 22 women. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4450.1s)]
*  I don't know if they raped 22 boys. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4451.86s)]
*  I don't know if they're perfect fucking citizens. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4454.02s)]
*  We don't know these things. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4456.02s)]
*  So this was just something… [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4458.1s)]
*  Listen, when I think of politics, I don't get involved, Joe Rogan, because it scares [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4459.9s)]
*  me. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4464.26s)]
*  The only thing that doesn't scare me is how a man, how a man could have 20,000 indictments [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4465.5s)]
*  and still lead the presidential fucking in our country. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4472.54s)]
*  This is why America is America. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4476.66s)]
*  How can fucking somebody have 92 fucking indictments? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4479.42s)]
*  He's in New York yelling yesterday. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4482.900000000001s)]
*  But he still has 50% of the fucking country on lockdown. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4485.02s)]
*  Right? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4488.46s)]
*  Isn't that like… [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4489.46s)]
*  He's beating Nikki Haley and the other guy. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4490.46s)]
*  Well, because it appears that they're prosecuting him for political purposes. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4493.34s)]
*  Yes, they are. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=4496.860000000001s)]

*  has been at least partially engineered by other countries. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5375.3s)]
*  I think the algorithm supporting that [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5379.22s)]
*  and pushing that out to people, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5381.18s)]

*  Super easily influenced. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5384.86s)]

*  where you just have to accept everything [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5387.82s)]
*  that happens to be trans, everything is fine [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5389.9s)]

*  This is a Willy Wonka golden ticket for perverts. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5398.54s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5401.58s)]
*  Wasn't there a fucking Ted Talk a couple years ago [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5402.42s)]

*  that this video we just watched is satire. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5408.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5412.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen other videos like this [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5412.98s)]
*  where there are people that, I don't know who they are, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5414.299999999999s)]
*  but there are groups of people [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5416.5s)]
*  that will make videos like this that make them seem real. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5417.34s)]
*  God, that lady's a great actress. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5420.62s)]
*  I'm not saying it is, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5423.62s)]
*  but I'm looking at a lot of comments on TikToks [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5424.5s)]
*  saying this is staged, this is fake. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5426.3s)]
*  Well, they might be right. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5428.5s)]
*  But that lady, if that's true, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5429.5s)]
*  that lady's a fucking great actress. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5431.18s)]
*  Because that lady really did seem like someone [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5434.0199999999995s)]
*  who was very flustered and was trying to protect her daughter. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5436.38s)]
*  Yes, she was. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5438.9s)]
*  And if it is satire and you use that daughter, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5439.94s)]
*  that girl was a really good actress too, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5441.74s)]
*  because she looked like a girl would respond [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5443.54s)]
*  if a fucking grown man was trying to get in the bathroom [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5445.54s)]
*  and her mother was fighting with this grown man. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5448.34s)]
*  Like, she was frozen. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5450.0199999999995s)]
*  So if that's true, if that is fake, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5452.38s)]
*  they're really good actors. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5455.86s)]

*  it's one of the biggest weight loss markets [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5479.58s)]
*  that's ever existed, that gets emerged. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5483.3s)]

*  Everywhere. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5487.42s)]
*  Like, how many people are on Ozempic [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5488.26s)]
*  and Wego V and all these other, like, what's the numbers? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5492.46s)]
*  GLP one. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5495.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, agonists or whatever they are. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5497.22s)]
*  That's not a free ride either. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5500.18s)]

*  He's one of the few people, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5505.38s)]
*  like a certain percentage of people, they do it, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5506.9400000000005s)]
*  they have a bad side effect. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5508.7s)]
*  And he was one of those terrible gastrointestinal pain. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5509.94s)]
*  Like, he was in agony. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5513.58s)]
*  Really? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5515.22s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5516.0599999999995s)]
*  He had to quit it right away. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5516.9s)]
*  One database that has... [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5518.099999999999s)]
*  I'm still a little apprehensive after the vaccine. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5520.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5522.94s)]
*  Because, you know, it was just another thing [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5523.78s)]
*  that just popped up. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5525.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5526.7s)]
*  If you had been talking about it for a few years, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5527.54s)]
*  I would have jumped on it, but it just popped up. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5528.78s)]
*  Well, some people, Brigham supports it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5531.42s)]
*  Brigham says it's like for people that want to lose weight, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5534.82s)]
*  it is one of the only ways where you can kind of guarantee [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5538.06s)]
*  that they can lose weight. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5541.18s)]
*  But there's the argument about that a lot of people [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5542.740000000001s)]
*  are losing muscle mass and they're losing bone mass [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5545.22s)]
*  along with the weight. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5551.46s)]
*  He's saying, yeah, but that's because [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5552.900000000001s)]
*  they're not doing it right. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5554.700000000001s)]
*  And they should also do it with peptides. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5555.780000000001s)]
*  And he said they should do it with resistance training. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5558.22s)]
*  Well, the guy I really know, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5561.1s)]
*  that he even talked to me about it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5563.620000000001s)]
*  He goes, Joey, consider it. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5565.22s)]
*  So look at this, it says 1.7% of people in the US [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5567.22s)]
*  have been prescribed a semi-glutide medication in 2023, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5572.9400000000005s)]
*  up 40-fold over the past five years. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5575.7s)]
*  So I mean, I never even heard of it before 2022. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5578.9800000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5582.66s)]
*  Okay, so that's then. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5585.62s)]
*  So 1.7% now. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5588.740000000001s)]
*  So somewhere around, some in the neighborhood [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5591.7s)]
*  of two million people, around in this country. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5593.42s)]
*  Now, my friend said, if you do it correctly, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5596.02s)]
*  he goes, what happened was doctors prescribed it to you [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5598.620000000001s)]
*  and nobody did the fucking research on it. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5601.42s)]
*  So they did the wrong dose. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5604.3s)]
*  I work out with a guy, Joe, for the life, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5605.14s)]
*  Tom, this motherfucker, he's very smart, like you. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5607.860000000001s)]
*  Very, like this is his thing. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5611.860000000001s)]
*  And I asked him once, because he asked me, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5614.38s)]
*  he goes, have you ever considered it? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5616.1s)]
*  I go, I don't know. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5617.14s)]
*  Do you recommend it? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5618.280000000001s)]
*  And he goes, let me tell you something, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5619.120000000001s)]
*  if you do it correctly, it'll work. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5619.9400000000005s)]
*  He goes, I read into a bunch of studies. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5621.860000000001s)]
*  But he goes, what they don't tell you [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5623.46s)]
*  is you have to change your eating. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5625.38s)]
*  You have to eat the protein first on your dish. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5628.42s)]
*  Because you're gonna get too full [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5632.18s)]
*  by the time you get to your carbs. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5633.74s)]
*  So he goes, people were eating it and eating salad. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5636.02s)]
*  And that's why they were losing the muscle mass [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5638.7s)]
*  and everything. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5640.46s)]
*  Because you gotta double your protein intake. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5641.3s)]
*  Now, like a bodybuilder needs 150 to 180 grams [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5644.78s)]
*  of fucking protein a day. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5648.1s)]
*  Joe, I could squeeze out 100 if I'm lucky, buddy. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5649.62s)]
*  Eggs, seven grams each, right? [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5653.26s)]
*  Three eggs for breakfast, no steak. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5656.42s)]
*  You know, I'll eat all that shit later. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5658.9800000000005s)]
*  But how do you do 150 fucking grams a day of protein? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5661.1s)]
*  All I eat is meat. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5665.780000000001s)]
*  That's five fucking meals. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5666.9800000000005s)]
*  That's five 30 gram meals. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5668.3s)]
*  I'm sure I get close to that. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5669.96s)]
*  So that's what he was saying, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5672.7s)]
*  that people were not doing it right. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5673.780000000001s)]
*  It works 80% better with resistance training. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5675.62s)]
*  Mm, I'm sure. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5679.860000000001s)]
*  80% better. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5680.68s)]
*  I'm sure. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5681.52s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5682.360000000001s)]
*  Anytime you're, well, you're essentially, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5683.18s)]
*  what it does is it kills your desire to eat, right? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5684.02s)]
*  It kills your appetite, right? [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5688.76s)]
*  So you eat less, right? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5690.8s)]
*  It's basically doing the same thing [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5693.42s)]
*  as if you had a controlled diet [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5694.68s)]
*  and you decided that you were gonna eat less. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5696.120000000001s)]
*  When you're going into starvation mode, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5698.120000000001s)]
*  so you're burning off more calories [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5700.240000000001s)]
*  than your body consumes, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5702.88s)]
*  your body's gonna start eating its tissue. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5705.080000000001s)]
*  You're gonna eat some muscle mass. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5707.4400000000005s)]
*  You're gonna eat some, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5709.56s)]
*  you're just not doing, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5710.48s)]
*  but if you did do it with peptides [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5711.679999999999s)]
*  and you did do it with weight lifting, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5714.0s)]
*  I would imagine you'd probably, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5716.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, I imagine a lot of that 35% they're talking about [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5717.4s)]
*  is like people didn't do anything. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5720.16s)]
*  I bet a lot of people just took the shots [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5722.36s)]
*  and especially they're overweight already. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5724.48s)]
*  And drinking alcohol. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5726.4s)]
*  They don't have a healthy lifestyle. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5727.48s)]
*  They can't eat, deserve some shit, no. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5728.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I do know that some people get side effects. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5729.5599999999995s)]
*  And that was Brian. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5732.94s)]
*  Brian got one of the bad side effects. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5734.08s)]
*  They're pretty common. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5735.719999999999s)]
*  Enough people get them to that. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5737.5199999999995s)]
*  It's something you have to consider. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5739.04s)]
*  So I called you about the peptide [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5740.8s)]
*  and then you turned me on. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5741.64s)]
*  Thank you again for the stem cells today. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5742.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I hope they help your knee, man. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5745.04s)]
*  I didn't pass out. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5747.0s)]
*  Good, beautiful. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5748.32s)]
*  I didn't faint. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5749.16s)]
*  I had to leave you in the room. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5750.0s)]
*  I knew, they were saying [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5750.84s)]
*  Joey's freaking out about needles. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5752.48s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5754.08s)]
*  I wish you would have came in [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5755.04s)]
*  and talked to me a little bit. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5756.0s)]
*  The nurses were great. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5757.62s)]
*  They're great. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5758.64s)]
*  Ways to Well's awesome. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5759.48s)]
*  I love that place. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5760.32s)]
*  I could tell you, and I even told her to her face, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5761.16s)]
*  I go, I'd love to tell you I felt a needle. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5762.96s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5766.099999999999s)]
*  Well, they're really good. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5766.94s)]
*  They're really good. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5767.76s)]
*  I love to tell you. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5768.599999999999s)]
*  I felt a needle. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5770.42s)]
*  I didn't even feel it. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5771.259999999999s)]
*  I put my iPod on. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5772.099999999999s)]
*  And they just shove it in there. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5772.94s)]
*  Beautiful. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5774.7s)]
*  Then I did the fucking IV. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5775.54s)]
*  They have people black out all the time. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5778.0199999999995s)]
*  You see the needle. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5780.38s)]
*  They go, oh. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5781.219999999999s)]
*  He was talking about GSP. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5782.0599999999995s)]
*  He was talking about GSP scared of needles. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5783.94s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5786.179999999999s)]
*  Isn't that funny, that guy? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5787.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm telling you that it is the weirdest fear [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5788.179999999999s)]
*  that you could ever fucking have. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5792.099999999999s)]
*  GSP is so interesting because he's such a man [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5794.259999999999s)]
*  that he's not afraid at all [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5796.9s)]
*  to tell you what he's afraid of. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5798.62s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5800.42s)]
*  He doesn't put on any. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5801.26s)]
*  No! [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5802.18s)]
*  There's no bluster. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5803.0199999999995s)]
*  There's no bullshit. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5803.9s)]
*  What he is is what he is. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5805.26s)]
*  Dog, I had a, my friend's parent when I was a kid, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5806.86s)]
*  I brought a snake into his house. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5809.82s)]
*  This guy was a fucking iron worker. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5811.94s)]
*  They're tough as nails. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5814.5599999999995s)]
*  Drake and Irish. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5815.62s)]
*  This guy was in the wall in the corner saying to me, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5817.42s)]
*  Joey, I beg you, get that out of my house. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5820.3s)]
*  And I kept busting his balls. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5823.14s)]
*  Come on. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5824.26s)]
*  Are you really scared of this little, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5825.28s)]
*  it was a little garter snake, dog. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5826.12s)]
*  I mean, he was ready to climb into a fucking corner there. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5829.3s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5831.74s)]
*  That's phobias. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5832.66s)]
*  Ophidiophobia. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5833.78s)]
*  Dog, the best one, I was telling her, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5834.9s)]
*  but I didn't tell her the truth. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5836.38s)]
*  I told the nurse about a different story, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5837.4s)]
*  but when I went to prison, you have to do a physical. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5839.78s)]
*  So here I am in prison, you gotta fuck it and hold your own. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5842.92s)]
*  I go in there, they put me at a desk, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5846.78s)]
*  and I'm like, Lord, don't let me pass out. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5848.3s)]
*  Not today. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5851.34s)]
*  Because I will wake up, these brothers will yank me, dog. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5853.3s)]
*  Do not pass out, and Joe, I fucking kept it together. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5856.62s)]
*  I went back into the holding tech, what up, what up, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5862.46s)]
*  what up, yeah, you know, we had, [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5865.14s)]
*  next thing you know, I fucking put the arm down, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5866.26s)]
*  I took the cotton ball off, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5868.96s)]
*  and there was a red dot on blood, and I fucking fainted. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5870.66s)]
*  I have thousands of them. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5873.46s)]
*  I never told anybody the truth on how I ripped my meniscus. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5878.32s)]
*  Let me tell you how I ripped my meniscus. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5881.98s)]
*  I was at acupuncture, and I was like this. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5883.76s)]
*  Because at that time, she didn't lay me down, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5887.1s)]
*  she sat me down, and I was like this, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5888.86s)]
*  and she started sticking needles into me, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5890.94s)]
*  and I fainted, and the chair, I buckled, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5892.46s)]
*  and I just fell off the chair onto the floor. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5895.32s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5897.14s)]
*  I tore my meniscus at acupuncture. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5898.3s)]
*  Who does that? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5900.82s)]
*  Dog, I have a thousand. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5902.58s)]
*  You know, my wife had to stop, she was my girlfriend, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5904.58s)]
*  she would send me down, I got a blood test, I wouldn't go. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5908.18s)]
*  I wouldn't go. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5912.38s)]
*  I would be petrified. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5914.58s)]
*  Petrified. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5917.04s)]
*  Petrified. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5917.88s)]
*  I used to date a girl, and when she saw someone [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5919.28s)]
*  getting a needle in a movie, she would faint. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5921.04s)]
*  Bro, I fainted in pulp fiction. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5922.719999999999s)]
*  When they stuck the needle in the heart, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5925.16s)]
*  I was on a date in Boulder, and all of a sudden, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5926.44s)]
*  the girls putting Raisinettes in my mouth, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5928.599999999999s)]
*  and shit, saying, I think you passed out. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5930.4s)]
*  I did fucking pass out. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5932.24s)]
*  Ah, she was trying to revive you with Raisinettes? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5933.5599999999995s)]
*  With Raisinettes, she didn't know. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5936.36s)]
*  She said, I just passed back. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5937.599999999999s)]
*  Come on, guys, I got 10, you know, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5939.679999999999s)]
*  and it's always hit and miss. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5942.679999999999s)]
*  Lately, the last 10 years, I've been very good. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5944.2s)]
*  Except for a couple IVs in my hand that didn't work, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5949.24s)]
*  but beside that, I've been very good. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5952.5599999999995s)]
*  Two, three months ago, I did the PRP on my knee. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5955.4s)]
*  They took six bloods, six tubes of blood out. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5958.2s)]
*  That was no bueno for Papa. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5961.32s)]
*  You know my boy Tommy? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5962.88s)]
*  Tommy, Tommy Jr.? [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5964.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5965.84s)]
*  Tommy just fell asleep behind the wheel. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5966.68s)]
*  Shoveling snow all day, shoveling his car out of snow, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5970.4s)]
*  driving, and he's got the dash cam footage. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5974.200000000001s)]
*  He just falls asleep, hits a fucking wall. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5976.320000000001s)]
*  Is he okay? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5979.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's banged up. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5980.64s)]
*  He's banged up, got some injuries. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5982.04s)]
*  But is he falling asleep? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5983.52s)]
*  He just doesn't know what happened. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5986.200000000001s)]
*  He just blacked out. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5987.280000000001s)]
*  He's blacked out driving from exertion. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5989.52s)]
*  You know, if you're a guy who's out of shape, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5992.6s)]
*  snow is heavy, right? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5995.320000000001s)]
*  Especially if it's melting a little bit, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5997.08s)]
*  and you gotta do your whole driveway. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=5998.92s)]
*  That's a workout, man. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6000.92s)]
*  That's a workout. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6002.0s)]
*  It's not a workout. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6002.84s)]
*  Not good after 50. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6004.04s)]
*  Well, it's not good if you're not in shape. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6005.28s)]
*  It's great if you're in shape. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6006.88s)]
*  It's a really good workout. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6008.52s)]
*  Like, you could get a, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6009.6s)]
*  I could put a fucking chest strap on [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6011.12s)]
*  and set an app for a workout and shovel in snow. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6013.400000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6016.28s)]
*  And it's a real workout. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6017.12s)]
*  We used to shovel snow when I was a kid. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6018.52s)]
*  That was a great way to make money. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6020.08s)]
*  I shoveled fucking snow when I was an adult. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6021.32s)]
*  For money? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6023.96s)]
*  When I was 19, I shoveled snow in Aspen. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6024.8s)]
*  It would knock on people's doors. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6027.08s)]
*  No, the guy just, I was part of the building crew. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6028.360000000001s)]
*  It was 15 an hour, and you went out there [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6031.04s)]
*  whatever hours you wanted. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6033.56s)]
*  It was work your own hours. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6034.84s)]
*  It was fucking fantastic. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6036.12s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6037.44s)]
*  I was also casing our joints, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6038.32s)]
*  because that's where all the drug dealers live, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6040.72s)]
*  so I was shoveling and casing. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6042.2s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a kid, we would make a ton of money. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6043.84s)]
*  Ton of money. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6045.96s)]
*  Now you can't get a kid to come out. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6046.8s)]
*  No. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6048.56s)]
*  In Jersey, nothing. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6049.38s)]
*  Nobody knocks on my door. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6050.52s)]
*  I was out there last week. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6051.68s)]
*  It was understood in the neighborhood [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6052.96s)]
*  that that's how people would make money. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6054.48s)]
*  So like the moment it would start snowing, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6056.4s)]
*  people would be showing up at people's houses, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6058.88s)]
*  asking if they wanted to get shoveled out. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6061.400000000001s)]
*  That was second. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6063.4800000000005s)]
*  I used to go on the roads and push motherfuckers. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6064.68s)]
*  That's a quick 20. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6067.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6069.0s)]
*  You push a motherfucker out of a hole, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6069.84s)]
*  he'll do anything for you, seriously. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6071.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's always people stuck too. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6073.16s)]
*  Pushing and then shoveling them out. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6074.6s)]
*  They got stuck, fucking putting rocks off there. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6076.84s)]
*  The thing is about like real cold places like that, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6079.24s)]
*  people will fucking help you, [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6081.4800000000005s)]
*  because they know you could die. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6082.64s)]
*  Like if you see a highway and some guys it's snowing, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6084.36s)]
*  and some guys over to the side of the road [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6086.8s)]
*  and his hood's up, let's pick this guy up. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6088.44s)]
*  Like it's a dangerous thing to do, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6091.2s)]
*  but a lot of people do it there. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6093.36s)]
*  A lot of people do it. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6094.96s)]
*  They'll pick people up in the snow. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6096.759999999999s)]
*  I would. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6098.919999999999s)]
*  Hey listen man, I just was told when I moved to Jersey [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6099.759999999999s)]
*  to be careful when I shovel. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6102.16s)]
*  A lot of people drop fucking shoveling snow. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6104.08s)]
*  You get off a heart attack. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6107.36s)]
*  It's real work. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6108.28s)]
*  But is it because of the cold weather? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6109.16s)]
*  Or? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6111.0s)]
*  Well the weather's cold, [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6111.879999999999s)]
*  but I don't think that's fucking you up. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6113.08s)]
*  I think it's just the exertion. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6114.36s)]
*  It's a lot of working out. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6115.879999999999s)]
*  Let's say you have a 100 yard driveway. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6117.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6121.5599999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6122.4s)]
*  Then you got to plop. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6123.24s)]
*  Okay let's say it's 20 yards. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6124.08s)]
*  Let's say a yard, that's a lot to shovel. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6124.92s)]
*  If it's wet, if it's melting a lot, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6128.12s)]
*  let's say that every shovel full is 40 pounds. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6130.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're doing every shovel full 40 pounds for reps, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6135.5199999999995s)]
*  so you're essentially doing this for reps [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6139.72s)]
*  and then carrying it, you're doing 500 reps? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6144.56s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6148.120000000001s)]
*  For example, after only two minutes of snow shoveling, [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6150.320000000001s)]
*  study participants' heart rates exceeded 85% [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6152.6s)]

*  during intense aerobic exercise testing. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6160.200000000001s)]
*  The impact is hardest on those people who are least fit. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6162.72s)]
*  Duh. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6165.280000000001s)]
*  And that's unfortunately my boy Tommy. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6166.120000000001s)]
*  So he just fucking, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6168.4400000000005s)]
*  and just blacked out on the wheel. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6171.6s)]
*  Yeah I just snowed, it snowed two weeks ago. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6173.08s)]
*  I got a two car driveway. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6176.08s)]
*  I shoveled it with my wife. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6177.96s)]
*  My daughter came out and threw some fucking salt. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6179.88s)]
*  I did the stairs. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6182.44s)]
*  We didn't touch the sidewalk [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6183.36s)]
*  because nobody walks on them. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6184.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're fit, you should look at it as your workout. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6185.64s)]
*  Dude that's a workout. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6188.04s)]

*  when they did the game last Sunday. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6233.400000000001s)]
*  So do they play in that snow? [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6234.24s)]
*  No. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6236.4800000000005s)]
*  They would have. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6237.32s)]

*  They come out after every play and blow off the lines. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6239.88s)]
*  Oh my God, that's hilarious. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6242.24s)]

*  That you have to play in the snow. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6264.32s)]
*  I mean that is the game, right? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6266.8s)]

*  Not this. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6274.88s)]
*  Why don't they play baseball in the rain? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6278.16s)]
*  Play it in the fucking rain. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6280.52s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6281.88s)]
*  Play the game in the rain. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6283.2s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6284.58s)]

*  We called it for rain. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6287.26s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6289.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's snowing. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6289.88s)]
*  Last week. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6292.0s)]
*  It's zero degrees and those guys are playing football. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6292.84s)]
*  Last week in Kansas City was the coldest football game [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6294.84s)]
*  of all time. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6298.64s)]
*  How cold was it? [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6300.12s)]
*  Minus nine outside. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6301.400000000001s)]
*  I think the wind show was minus. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6302.96s)]
*  There was motherfuckers with no t-shirts on. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6305.400000000001s)]
*  I guess like 60 people went to the hospital. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6307.36s)]
*  Eee hee hee hee. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6309.92s)]
*  Audience members. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6311.16s)]
*  69 people needed help from the fire department. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6312.0s)]
*  Do you know one of the dudes that survived the Titanic, [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6314.52s)]
*  he was in the water for two hours. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6317.8s)]
*  I think he was a chef. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6319.96s)]
*  And the story was that he got drunk [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6321.400000000001s)]
*  before he went in the water. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6323.56s)]
*  He just got hammered because he knew he was gonna die. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6325.280000000001s)]
*  And somehow or another, because he was drunk, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6327.68s)]
*  he survived. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6331.360000000001s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6332.9400000000005s)]
*  I was reading this. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6334.320000000001s)]
*  I was like, how does that make sense? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6335.16s)]
*  How a baker survived the Titanic [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6336.66s)]
*  sinking by getting really drunk. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6338.76s)]
*  God damn, I have bonkers, these motherfuckers. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6341.72s)]
*  Do do do. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6345.24s)]
*  There we go, okay. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6347.08s)]
*  So can you go back up so I can read, scroll. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6348.76s)]
*  So it says Charles, how do you say that? [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6351.5599999999995s)]
*  Jo-hin, how do you say that, Jamie? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6353.4s)]
*  Jo-hin, Jo-hin was one of the disasters [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6356.64s)]
*  most unlikely survivors and he did it [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6359.32s)]
*  thanks to industrial amounts of liquor. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6361.12s)]
*  So this dude got super duper hammered [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6363.88s)]
*  before he went in the water. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6368.08s)]
*  And somehow or another, it helped him survive. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6369.72s)]
*  It was an almost physiologically impossible [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6373.42s)]
*  feat of survival. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6378.5s)]
*  And according to the British Titanic inquiry, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6379.66s)]
*  it was because the 33 year old Englishman [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6381.9s)]
*  had the presence of mind to greet history's [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6384.42s)]
*  greatest maritime disaster by getting smashed. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6387.26s)]
*  He knew he was dying. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6391.82s)]
*  He knew he was dying. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6392.78s)]
*  So he just decided to get fucked up and he survived. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6393.78s)]
*  In survival situations, having all that warm blood [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6397.139999999999s)]
*  away from the vital organs means that the drinker [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6399.76s)]
*  is at a greater risk of hyperthermia. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6402.26s)]
*  However, Canadian hypothermia expert, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6404.14s)]
*  Gordon Geisbrecht, figures in the minus two degrees [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6406.820000000001s)]
*  Celsius temperature of the North Atlantic, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6412.38s)]
*  the water was cold enough to quickly tighten [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6414.52s)]
*  Jo-hin's blood vessels and cancel out [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6417.14s)]
*  any effects of the alcohol. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6419.9400000000005s)]
*  So then, at low to moderate doses of alcohol, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6423.22s)]
*  cold will win out, says Geisbrecht. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6426.7s)]
*  The University of Manitoba professor has performed [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6430.1s)]
*  hundreds of cold water immersion studies. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6432.3s)]
*  What Geisbrecht would have had, however, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6434.3s)]
*  is the awesome life-saving power of liquid courage. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6437.740000000001s)]
*  Alcohol remains a leading cause of humans [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6441.58s)]

*  Nevertheless, the relaxing qualities of the drug [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6446.34s)]
*  have long been known to give humans an uncanny ability [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6448.700000000001s)]
*  to survive trauma. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6451.34s)]
*  This reminded me of the story of that lady [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6453.26s)]
*  that passed out in the snow and her friends [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6454.740000000001s)]
*  found her the next day. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6457.88s)]
*  They brought her in and she was still alive. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6459.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're saying right here, [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6461.82s)]
*  in the ER, cold patients who are really drunk [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6462.66s)]
*  can walk in and they're conscious at a temperature [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6464.9400000000005s)]
*  that they shouldn't be. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6467.46s)]

*  Keep scrolling down a little more. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6472.9400000000005s)]
*  That's it? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6474.82s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6475.9s)]
*  Yeah, his actions might speak to a man [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6477.02s)]
*  unfazed by impending disaster. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6479.82s)]
*  Immediately upon hearing the collision with an iceberg, [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6481.4800000000005s)]
*  the chief baker leapt out of his bunk [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6483.74s)]
*  and began dispatching his staff to stock the lifeboats [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6485.54s)]
*  with bread and biscuits. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6488.14s)]
*  This done, he popped back into his cabin for a drink [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6489.52s)]
*  before heading topside to help load lifeboats. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6492.1s)]
*  Not only did Joaquin, however I say his name, Jogin, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6494.900000000001s)]
*  refuse his own place on a boat, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6500.5s)]
*  but he, there's no men like that today, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6502.860000000001s)]
*  but he and a few other men became forcibly chuckling, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6505.1s)]
*  chucking reluctant women into empty seats, [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6509.14s)]
*  likely saving their lives. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6512.26s)]
*  He said we threw them in, he testified later. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6513.740000000001s)]
*  Top deck of the increasingly listing Titanic [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6515.8s)]
*  was mostly cleared of lifeboats by 1.30 a.m. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6518.96s)]
*  To most, this was a panic-inducing sign [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6521.6s)]
*  that all hopes of rescue was gone, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6523.96s)]
*  but to whatever his name is, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6525.72s)]
*  it was a cue to head back to his cabin for another drink. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6527.9400000000005s)]
*  So this dude's just getting fucked up. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6531.320000000001s)]
*  He sat down on his bunk and nursed it along, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6533.400000000001s)]
*  aware but not particularly caring [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6536.2s)]
*  that the water now rippled through the cabin doorway, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6538.320000000001s)]
*  wrote historian Walter Lord in a night to remember. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6541.08s)]
*  Lord was in touch with the dude [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6544.56s)]
*  before the Baker's 1956 death. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6546.56s)]
*  He said the dude then splashed topside again, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6549.64s)]
*  where he took upon himself [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6553.38s)]
*  to begin throwing deck chairs overboard [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6554.4800000000005s)]
*  with an eye to filling the water [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6556.320000000001s)]
*  with impromptu flotation devices [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6558.280000000001s)]
*  so that people could float around on the chairs. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6561.780000000001s)]
*  As perched, he then worked his way back to the pantry [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6564.080000000001s)]
*  to get a drink of water. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6566.4400000000005s)]
*  The Baker was standing on the stern [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6567.26s)]
*  when the ship broke in half, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6568.4800000000005s)]
*  and yet he remembered the violent catastrophic breakup [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6570.6s)]
*  only as a great list over to port. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6573.48s)]
*  There was no great shock or anything, he told the inquirer, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6576.5599999999995s)]
*  so he was just hammered. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6579.259999999999s)]
*  Definitely moving through the swarms of people, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6581.5199999999995s)]
*  he made it to the stern rail of the ship exactly 2 20 a.m. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6583.679999999999s)]
*  He rode the sinking Titanic into the sea like an elevator. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6587.66s)]
*  Whoo! [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6592.44s)]
*  As with all surviving Titanic crew members, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6594.28s)]
*  2 20 a.m. on April 15th, 1912 was also the exact moment [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6597.36s)]
*  in which the White Star Line stopped paying him. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6601.28s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6604.679999999999s)]
*  The first stage of cold water immersion [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6605.92s)]
*  is known as cold shock, [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6608.04s)]
*  horrifying sensation of having the skin cool, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6609.639999999999s)]
*  the feelings with the Titanic. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6611.84s)]
*  Second officer, Charles Lighthower, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6612.96s)]
*  described as being like a thousand knives [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6616.44s)]
*  being driven into one's body. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6619.139999999999s)]
*  So how did this dude survive? [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6621.92s)]
*  What did he float around on for two hours? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6624.12s)]
*  Did it say? [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6626.4s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6627.24s)]
*  Paddling and treading water, he said. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6632.08s)]
*  I was just paddling and treading water for two hours? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6633.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6638.28s)]
*  How come Leo couldn't do that then in the movie? [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6639.44s)]
*  Just sunk in the water after two minutes. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6643.24s)]
*  But Leo wasn't hammered and he gave up. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6645.0s)]
*  This dude didn't give up. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6647.92s)]
*  He paddled water for hours. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6649.599999999999s)]
*  I guess it took a couple hours for them [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6651.62s)]
*  to get someone to get to them. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6653.36s)]
*  Yeah, he's after two hours. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6654.96s)]
*  Which is pretty impressive [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6656.4s)]
*  that they got to them in two hours. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6657.879999999999s)]
*  In 19 what? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6661.36s)]
*  What was this like? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6662.4s)]
*  19, somewhere around there. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6663.36s)]
*  I don't know the exact, 1912, I don't know. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6665.44s)]
*  The early 1900s. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6667.799999999999s)]
*  So the fact they got to them in two hours [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6668.799999999999s)]
*  is pretty amazing, 1919. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6671.12s)]
*  Oh no, 107th. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6674.12s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6676.24s)]
*  So. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6677.759999999999s)]
*  12. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6678.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, 1912, wow. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6679.42s)]
*  Let me go think real quick. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6681.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go too. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6683.2s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6684.4s)]
*  Yeah, so she fell out of an airplane [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6685.8s)]
*  and she landed on an anthill? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6689.360000000001s)]
*  How big was that fucking anthill? [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6694.16s)]
*  And it was fire ants? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6697.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, this one here doesn't say that. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6699.76s)]
*  It was a 1999 47 year old woman, Joan Murray, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6701.2s)]
*  altitude of 14,500 feet. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6705.28s)]
*  Second parachute also failed to deploy. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6708.84s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6711.14s)]
*  Crashed into a fire ant mound [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6712.5199999999995s)]
*  at more than 80 miles an hour. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6714.839999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6716.5199999999995s)]
*  Immediately started attacking her body [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6717.719999999999s)]
*  which kept her alive because of the adrenaline. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6719.719999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6724.16s)]
*  And then she still survived. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6725.4s)]
*  She was in a coma for two weeks, had operations, [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6726.959999999999s)]
*  but she is still alive I think. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6729.919999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6732.36s)]
*  I wonder if the, [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6734.08s)]
*  did they slow her down at all, the parachutes? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6736.0199999999995s)]
*  80 miles an hour is pretty fucking fast. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6738.719999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6741.76s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what terminal velocity is [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6742.6s)]
*  if you don't have one, but. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6744.12s)]
*  Fuck parachutes, bro. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6747.8s)]
*  Fuck parachutes. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6749.72s)]
*  I'd like to try it one day. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6751.52s)]
*  I can set it up. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6753.2s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6754.28s)]
*  You have the guy here? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6755.12s)]
*  Oh yeah, I got guys. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6755.96s)]
*  Hi. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6756.8s)]
*  Do you have to go? [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6757.64s)]
*  I don't know, I don't do it. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6758.4800000000005s)]
*  You wouldn't even consider it for a rush one. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6759.68s)]
*  You might not be able to, you might be too big. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6761.88s)]

*  on Kill Tony that he had to lose weight. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6768.32s)]

*  I don't think you'd be like above 220 or something like that. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6777.0s)]
*  No, I don't think the parachute would hold Papa. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6780.0s)]
*  No, and you have to have someone on your back too. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6782.84s)]
*  The first time you do it, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6786.12s)]

*  is just put his legs around him. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6830.12s)]
*  Well no, they gave him a parachute. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6831.679999999999s)]

*  I don't know if you have to do that. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6860.76s)]
*  That's not a little shit. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6861.88s)]
*  Jumping out of a fucking plane with no parachute. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6863.04s)]
*  That's not a little thing. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6865.72s)]
*  I mean you gotta fucking get a rise [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6866.88s)]
*  onto something after a while. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6868.68s)]
*  I think that's a big thing. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6870.4800000000005s)]
*  I would advise you not doing that one. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6871.84s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6873.68s)]

*  I get it. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6876.6s)]
*  You know, I still remember going to Colorado [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6877.4400000000005s)]
*  when I was 19 and people go, do you wanna go ski? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6879.4400000000005s)]

*  I'll never ski. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6886.28s)]
*  Skiing, this, that. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6887.6s)]
*  You hurt, you break your legs. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6888.92s)]
*  Until I got up there, Joe. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6891.12s)]
*  I was so lonely on Christmas day I go fuck it. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6892.72s)]
*  Let me go get some skis and go up there. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6896.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6897.92s)]
*  And it would change my life. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6898.76s)]
*  And ever since that I'm like, you know, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6899.6s)]
*  every once in a while, listen, it's not gonna work out. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6900.84s)]
*  It's not like I can ski now in no fucking way. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6903.2s)]
*  But at least I got to do it. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6906.44s)]
*  The thing about skiing is everybody tries [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6908.2s)]
*  to go on harder courses than you can control. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6910.2s)]
*  You have to really learn how to. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6912.72s)]
*  You gotta live there. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6914.04s)]
*  Or you gotta go to every, it's like anything else. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6915.96s)]
*  You wanna get good at stand up, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6918.64s)]
*  you gotta show up and do the dance. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6919.64s)]
*  You gotta get good at jitsu, whatever. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6920.84s)]
*  Weight lifting, whatever. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6922.64s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6923.68s)]
*  Well also, there's a lot of people that try skiing [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6924.68s)]
*  that don't do anything else. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6926.68s)]
*  No, and the worst thing is when people say to me, [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6928.08s)]
*  I'm going skiing, they haven't done anything. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6931.5199999999995s)]
*  They haven't done anything. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6934.88s)]
*  First of all, you go to Aspen. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6935.72s)]
*  I used to be a fucking security fucking driver up there. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6937.56s)]
*  I'd see the people that would come in, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6940.92s)]
*  the amount of alcohol, the amount of shit. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6942.32s)]
*  Let me tell you what happens. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6944.719999999999s)]
*  After one day of skiing, if you're not skiing consistently, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6946.08s)]
*  bro, you use muscles you haven't used before. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6949.599999999999s)]
*  I don't care how many squats you do in kettlebells, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6952.5199999999995s)]
*  let's go skiing. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6954.88s)]
*  Just three times down a medium hill, [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6956.2s)]
*  the next day you'll go fuck, this hurts in here, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6958.5599999999995s)]
*  my hamstrings hurt, different things hurt. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6961.24s)]
*  They use different fucking muscles when you ski. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6963.679999999999s)]
*  So people go up there, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6966.5599999999995s)]
*  dog, that's not a, you gotta prepare for that shit. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6967.679999999999s)]
*  But I lived in Snowmass. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6970.5599999999995s)]
*  So it was like going to a summer camp. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6972.56s)]
*  I got to ski every day, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6974.32s)]
*  whether it was two runs before work [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6976.52s)]
*  or three runs after work. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6978.4400000000005s)]
*  So you get good, you get used to it. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6980.32s)]
*  The fall's become easier, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6982.84s)]
*  the next thing you know you're up there [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6984.2s)]
*  with no winter jacket. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6985.08s)]
*  Fuck, I don't need no fucking winter jacket. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6987.68s)]
*  This'll do, a hooded sweatshirt. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6989.2s)]
*  It's great. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6991.32s)]
*  Do you ski without a helmet? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6992.16s)]
*  There wasn't even helmets for skiing when I was skiing. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6993.96s)]
*  This is 50 fucking years ago. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6996.08s)]
*  You went up there, you know, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6998.64s)]
*  and then it was just something that [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=6999.92s)]
*  I never thought I would do, like white water rafting. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7002.56s)]
*  That shit is great up there, you know. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7005.96s)]
*  You go down from Aspen all the way down [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7008.0s)]
*  to Glenwood Springs and shit. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7009.6s)]
*  I loved all that crazy stuff. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7011.12s)]
*  But I don't like camping [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7014.56s)]
*  because you can't wash your pussy. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7016.4800000000005s)]
*  Okay, I'm not gonna sit with you in a tent for four days [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7019.08s)]
*  with a stinky asshole. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7021.400000000001s)]
*  That ain't an adventure for me. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7022.96s)]
*  If you wanna go camping, I'm like a white camper. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7024.76s)]
*  I wanna shower, I want a restaurant, [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7027.04s)]
*  there's something on the location. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7029.96s)]
*  There's those things. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7032.0s)]
*  But I always wanted to bungee jump one time or something. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7033.0s)]
*  Something out of a plane, just something. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7038.48s)]
*  Nothing have to be, you know, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7041.36s)]

*  But just for somebody to say, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7049.2s)]
*  you could jump off that cliff in Hawaii and land [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7051.16s)]
*  and you got 100 feet under you, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7054.24s)]
*  nothing's gonna happen to you. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7056.2s)]

*  I know someone who landed on their ass. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7062.32s)]
*  They landed on their ass instead of straight [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7064.04s)]
*  and they fucked their back up. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7065.599999999999s)]
*  No, you're done, you're done. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7066.759999999999s)]

*  and it's gonna kill somebody. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7072.599999999999s)]
*  That Red Bull can, that's 15,000 feet in the air. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7073.44s)]

*  for almost killing a dude in Puerto Rico. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7079.16s)]
*  I went to Puerto Rico and my parents, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7081.44s)]
*  my mom and the other parents left us alone and went out. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7083.12s)]
*  And we started throwing fucking ice off the balcony and shit [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7086.8s)]
*  and we kept on throwing it and throwing it. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7089.88s)]
*  And next thing you know, I heard an ambulance [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7092.16s)]
*  and fucking cops were knocking on all the doors [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7093.88s)]
*  and they knew it was us. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7096.360000000001s)]

*  Man, I used to do so many crazy things like that, Joe. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7111.96s)]
*  When I was on 88th Street, when I was like six or seven, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7115.6s)]
*  I would play with these kids. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7118.64s)]
*  There was a 205 West 88th Street was on the corner, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7119.84s)]
*  then there was a parking garage, it's still there. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7122.8s)]
*  And I would play in there with the kids [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7125.160000000001s)]
*  and then when I would get a little bit of anxiety, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7126.6s)]
*  I would go up to my apartment, to my bedroom [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7129.160000000001s)]
*  and my mother used to have the 45s [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7132.0s)]
*  from the record player at the bar [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7133.96s)]
*  and she would give me the ones she'd take out [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7136.120000000001s)]
*  and I'd go by the window and I'd just throw them out [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7137.92s)]
*  and they would come out like boomerangs [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7140.360000000001s)]
*  and come down and you hear, hey, stop that. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7142.64s)]
*  I'd just throw like 50 of them out [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7145.08s)]
*  and then you hear the kids going, hey, fuck you. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7146.64s)]
*  They didn't know it was me. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7149.6s)]
*  And then I would come back, what happened? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7151.08s)]
*  Some motherfucker there's throwing fucking things on me. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7152.64s)]
*  One day I kid a kid with a thing, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7155.4400000000005s)]
*  he just fell down for a few minutes. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7157.96s)]
*  Another time, there was a place when I was growing up [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7159.76s)]
*  in North Bergen called Duratest. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7165.4s)]
*  They just made light bulbs. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7169.16s)]
*  But they made the long fluorescent ones. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7172.28s)]
*  How many times I hit in the head with those, [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7174.04s)]
*  we would jump in their dumpster [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7176.04s)]
*  and take all the fluorescent bulbs out and light bulbs [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7178.24s)]
*  and just hit each other with it, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7181.48s)]
*  that dust that comes out of a fucking fluorescent light bulb [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7182.6s)]
*  in the 70s. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7185.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7186.48s)]
*  We would have those light bulb wars all the time [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7187.68s)]
*  and then we started having them from the roofs [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7189.88s)]
*  and people would throw light bulbs up at us [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7191.96s)]
*  and we would throw light bulbs back [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7195.0s)]
*  and I would put the light bulbs on the floor [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7197.08s)]
*  and then we'd call them spears, you know, [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7198.88s)]
*  the fucking, we'd throw the fucking [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7201.400000000001s)]
*  long fluorescent lights at them. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7203.08s)]
*  One day I picked up a light bulb, [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7205.12s)]
*  I didn't know I picked up a rock with that motherfucker [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7206.360000000001s)]
*  and I just drew it at the kid [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7208.96s)]
*  and all of a sudden the kid's looking right at me [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7210.24s)]
*  and I saw that rock just go, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7211.6s)]
*  and he just went backwards. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7213.4400000000005s)]
*  Now this was a pervert kid, his name was Ali, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7214.96s)]
*  him and his brother. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7217.16s)]

*  in the city when he was like 10, 11 [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7223.08s)]

*  they washed our dick, it was tremendous. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7226.16s)]
*  I hit that kid in the head so hard with that rock [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7229.2s)]
*  without knowing, it wasn't no malice intended, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7231.84s)]
*  but when I got down there, the lump had gone up [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7234.599999999999s)]

*  I didn't even go in. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7629.84s)]
*  When I finished, I just jumped into the audience. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7630.96s)]
*  There was no sense of going in the back [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7633.8s)]
*  because they weren't gonna have it. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7635.72s)]

*  Always a good place for pool, too. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7655.88s)]
*  Think about the things that come out of Philly. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7657.64s)]
*  A lot of boxers, a lot of pool players. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7658.76s)]
*  There was always good pool halls in Philly. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7661.88s)]
*  They still have a lot of them? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7664.200000000001s)]

*  Yeah, but great fucking old school pool hall. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7715.16s)]
*  Real pool hall. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7719.68s)]

*  it's like I finally watched the show, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7724.56s)]
*  because I read a book and then I said, [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7727.240000000001s)]
*  let me watch the show, Boardwalk Empire. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7728.8s)]
*  I don't know if you ever watched that, whatever it was. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7732.92s)]
*  I watched a little bit of it, it's good. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7734.64s)]
*  Very interesting, because very interesting. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7735.8s)]
*  It took the history of Atlantic City [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7738.320000000001s)]
*  and then the last two seasons, it touched on the Hagues. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7740.64s)]
*  And the Hagues were like fucking huge. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7745.120000000001s)]
*  And that's where I went for my surgery one time [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7747.6s)]
*  when I was a kid, Margaret Hague. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7751.320000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, that's who you gave birth to kids. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7752.92s)]
*  I went to Christ Hospital. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7755.76s)]
*  Margaret Hague was a hospital in Jersey City [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7757.56s)]
*  and they were all related. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7761.2s)]
*  So I just followed that and I just started reading [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7762.28s)]
*  all that Philadelphia shit. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7764.92s)]
*  There's a town by me called Highland. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7767.08s)]
*  Highland, New Jersey, they just built a ferry [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7769.4800000000005s)]
*  to take you from Highland to New York City. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7771.92s)]
*  That's where fucking Vito Genovese lived. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7774.24s)]
*  I didn't know this shit like that. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7776.88s)]
*  All those towns have a rich fucking history [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7778.24s)]
*  of just everything, pool, gangsters, fucking food. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7781.32s)]
*  The fucking food down in Jersey now [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7786.04s)]
*  is fucking tremendous, Joe. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7788.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's different kind of food. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7792.32s)]
*  That East Coast Italian food, that's different. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7793.5199999999995s)]
*  But everybody has a different type of East Coast. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7795.96s)]
*  Like if you go to El Nido, they got the nice chicken, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7798.32s)]
*  they got the pasta, the steaks, and that's that place. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7801.639999999999s)]
*  I go to another place, I just go there for the fucking, [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7804.84s)]

*  Water with lemon and a bowl of escarole soup with beans [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7825.24s)]
*  and they put little bits of fucking prosciutto in there [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7829.72s)]
*  or that ham or something, oh my God, Joe. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7832.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't even need the fucking sauce [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=7835.84s)]

*  Rayos? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8192.64s)]
*  Like the famous restaurant from New York, Rayos. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8193.56s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8195.72s)]

*  They have one in LA. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8198.24s)]
*  Yeah, you could do it in Vegas for sure. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8199.48s)]
*  But they opened up in Vegas. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8201.36s)]
*  People are spreading out, so that's good. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8204.36s)]
*  They just opened up a Peter Lugar's in Vegas. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8206.56s)]
*  Yes, that's what it was, I'm sorry. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8210.4s)]
*  It was Peter Lugar. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8212.4s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8213.24s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8214.08s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8214.9s)]
*  That place is the shit. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8216.119999999999s)]
*  If I'm ever in Brooklyn, I'm eating at Peter Lugar's. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8218.48s)]
*  I always go. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8220.16s)]
*  That place rules. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8221.119999999999s)]
*  Last time I went with Ari, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8221.96s)]
*  we caught a four o'clock fucking dinner reservation. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8223.759999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8226.759999999998s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8227.599999999999s)]
*  Let's do it. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8228.42s)]
*  That place is great. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8229.259999999998s)]
*  They got a bad review in like the New York Times [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8230.099999999999s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8231.96s)]
*  And me and Ari had just gone there. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8232.8s)]
*  And we were like, what the fuck are they talking about? [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8234.519999999999s)]
*  It was fantastic. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8238.279999999999s)]
*  It was so good. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8240.519999999999s)]
*  The steak comes over, it's crackling, [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8241.439999999999s)]
*  the butter's dripping all over it. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8243.359999999999s)]
*  It's cut all over for you. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8244.599999999999s)]
*  You take a slice of it, you're like, it's perfect. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8245.599999999999s)]
*  It's the perfect steak. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8248.72s)]
*  And you're getting the smell from the plate. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8249.56s)]
*  The plate's coming out of the oven where they finish it. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8252.0s)]
*  You're like, ah, don't touch the plate. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8254.12s)]
*  It's hot, okay. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8257.4s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8258.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8260.36s)]
*  That place rules. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8261.2s)]
*  And it's right there. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8262.04s)]
*  It's easy to get there. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8262.86s)]
*  I'd rather go there than go to the city. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8263.7s)]
*  There's a video, like a documentary [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8265.4s)]
*  on how they pick their cattle and how they... [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8267.66s)]
*  There's like a documentary on steak [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8270.08s)]
*  and the Peter Lugar part is like a big part of it. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8272.960000000001s)]
*  Because these people are trying to figure out [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8275.460000000001s)]
*  why the fuck are these steaks so good? [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8276.72s)]
*  Like people from other countries were coming to study [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8278.4s)]
*  how Peter Lugar's making their steaks. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8280.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8284.24s)]
*  That fucking place is tremendous. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8285.64s)]
*  So they take you through the entire step, [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8287.199999999999s)]
*  like how much they age it, what they do, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8289.8s)]
*  and you go to how they treat it. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8292.599999999999s)]
*  So they get it down to the size and they trim it. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8294.48s)]
*  I mean, they've been doing this shit for 100 years. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8297.84s)]
*  Peter Lugar's is from the 1800s, I think. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8302.08s)]
*  Like when did that place open? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8304.679999999998s)]
*  Who showed us that they had a credit card from Peter Lugar? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8306.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8308.599999999999s)]
*  Somebody we hung out, their dad. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8309.439999999999s)]
*  See, look, they just put salt on it, that's it. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8310.839999999998s)]
*  And they get it in one of those broilers. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8313.16s)]
*  So they have those broilers [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8315.599999999999s)]
*  where the flame is above the steak. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8316.9s)]
*  So it's not like direct heat on the steak [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8319.519999999999s)]
*  where the fat is dripping down, you get flare ups. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8322.119999999999s)]
*  No, the flame is above the steak. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8325.019999999999s)]
*  And then they flip it and then they slice it up [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8327.16s)]
*  and then they put it on a plate. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8330.06s)]
*  And then once they slice it up and put it on a plate, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8331.8s)]
*  then they put it in the oven [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8333.96s)]
*  and they finish it in the oven. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8336.119999999999s)]
*  And oh my goodness, dude. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8338.4s)]
*  See, they do it like that. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8341.039999999999s)]
*  They put it on a plate, finish, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8342.119999999999s)]
*  motherfucker, and when they pull that bitch out, [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8344.359999999999s)]
*  it's just, oh. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8347.08s)]
*  So that's her right now setting it up. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8354.0s)]
*  Then they bring it out to these people. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8355.8s)]
*  Look at that, they put the drippings on there. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8357.24s)]
*  Come on, son, come on. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8359.119999999999s)]
*  Sensational. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8361.759999999998s)]
*  Should we get out of here? [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8363.64s)]
*  You done? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8364.72s)]
*  No, no, I was just looking. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8365.56s)]
*  My daughter sent me a picture of her fucking sledding. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8366.64s)]
*  Is it snowing in Jersey right now? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8371.4s)]
*  Fuck, six in the morning. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8372.8s)]
*  When I woke up this morning, [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8374.119999999999s)]
*  I already had a notice that they closed school. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8375.039999999999s)]
*  School was supposed to be a half day, [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8377.199999999999s)]
*  but it started snowing at six in the fucking morning. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8378.74s)]
*  And they went to, it's still snowing, bro. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8381.359999999999s)]
*  I loved snow days when I was a kid. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8384.039999999999s)]
*  They were the best. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8386.119999999999s)]
*  That's when you hustled. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8387.08s)]
*  That's when we made money. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8388.199999999999s)]
*  You made money, but also you get to stay home. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8389.16s)]
*  You look out the window, you're like, fuck yeah. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8391.2s)]
*  No school. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8394.04s)]

*  With us, we had to wait till like 11.30, [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8406.0s)]
*  then you got a call from somebody, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8408.240000000002s)]

*  Why? [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8454.16s)]
*  Because I can't hear you. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8455.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8456.560000000001s)]
*  That's okay. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8457.4s)]
*  No, so that's the problem that you. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8461.24s)]
*  Do you ever roll blunts, or do you only roll joints? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8463.24s)]
*  You know, I got pneumonia last summer. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8468.32s)]
*  Did you? [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8470.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I have a hard time breathing now. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8470.86s)]
*  How'd you get pneumonia? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8472.92s)]
*  I had no fucking idea. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8474.6s)]
*  Pneumonia, rather. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8475.92s)]
*  Pneumonia. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8476.76s)]
*  Joe, everything was going great. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8477.6s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8479.56s)]
*  What happened? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8480.84s)]
*  Something? [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8481.68s)]
*  Oh. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8482.5s)]
*  I was getting shortness of breath. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8483.34s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8485.16s)]
*  So I went to the doctor. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8486.08s)]
*  First they told me I had a kidney stone. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8487.04s)]
*  Then I went and got a scan for the kidney stone. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8490.0s)]
*  There was no kidney stone, but they saw something else, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8491.880000000001s)]
*  and they made me go in for a lung x-ray. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8495.0s)]
*  And at the lung x-ray is where they fucking, [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8499.32s)]
*  well, like, you got a fucking pneumonia. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8502.720000000001s)]
*  I didn't know. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8504.92s)]
*  It took like three weeks to find that. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8505.76s)]
*  I couldn't walk to my mailbox, Joe. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8508.36s)]
*  I'd walk to my mailbox and I'd be huffing and fucking puffing. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8510.92s)]
*  How'd you get rid of it? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8513.68s)]
*  The blunts. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8515.16s)]
*  No. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8516.0s)]
*  Oh, the blunts were giving it to you? [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8516.82s)]
*  How many blunts were you smoking? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8518.48s)]
*  Two, but that's not, I'm not a cigar guy. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8520.28s)]
*  I'm the only Cuban, I'm looking at your fucking [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8524.24s)]
*  cigar collection before, and I'm like, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8526.28s)]
*  I'm the only fucking Cuban that has no, I love a cigar. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8528.36s)]
*  I liked, Ron White gave me these little ones. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8532.08s)]
*  These are little cigars. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8533.960000000001s)]
*  So if you don't want to have a whole cigar, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8535.4s)]
*  you just want a little puff, it's little Monte Cristo's. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8536.72s)]
*  And those are really good too. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8541.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8542.56s)]
*  Those are good. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8543.4s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's good, it's good tobacco. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8544.22s)]
*  But it's so that you don't have to finish the cigar. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8545.359999999999s)]
*  You just want a little puff. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8547.439999999999s)]
*  Those fucking cigars are too big to get me dizzy. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8548.279999999999s)]
*  So. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8551.039999999999s)]
*  It's just a little puff. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8551.88s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8552.84s)]
*  Something was just bothering me. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8553.76s)]
*  And I, what else can I be doing? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8555.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's not good for you. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8557.56s)]
*  You know, I would love for you to get healthier. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8559.16s)]
*  And I know at one point in time, like I said, [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8562.48s)]
*  you'd lost a lot of weight. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8564.439999999999s)]
*  You lost, what'd you lose? [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8565.62s)]
*  I mean, you must've lost close to 80 pounds. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8567.660000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8569.62s)]
*  What'd you lose at one point in time? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8570.460000000001s)]
*  I started at four something. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8572.820000000002s)]
*  But there's one time when the Weight Watchers time [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8575.18s)]
*  where it was pretty quickly. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8577.320000000002s)]
*  It was over like a period of 10 months. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8578.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8580.740000000002s)]
*  Everybody was like, look how good Joey looks. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8581.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8582.94s)]
*  And dog, I still look good. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8583.78s)]
*  Don't get confused, motherfucker. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8585.900000000001s)]
*  For 60, I still look fucking good. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8587.62s)]
*  You've had a hard 60, son. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8590.34s)]
*  I should've looked like Hazy Osborne right now. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8591.54s)]
*  You've had a rough 60. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8593.62s)]
*  I mean, you've had 60. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8594.98s)]
*  You put some fucking miles on your wheels. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8595.859999999999s)]
*  It was 60, you know. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8598.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8599.14s)]
*  I didn't know what my life was about [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8599.98s)]
*  until I read that fucking, [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8601.42s)]
*  until I wrote that book. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8602.42s)]
*  And then I read it and I was like, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8603.859999999999s)]
*  I gotta take a breather. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8606.46s)]
*  Yeah, you've had an extraordinary life, my friend. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8608.5s)]
*  And that's why when I moved to Jersey, I said, [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8610.859999999999s)]
*  you know what, man, it's time for me [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8612.66s)]
*  just to chill for a while. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8613.939999999999s)]
*  I wanted to get out of the train of thought I had of comedy. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8616.26s)]
*  That old mentality I had, I wanted to give that a breather. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8619.74s)]
*  I couldn't get away from it. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8622.3s)]
*  I couldn't get away from it. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8623.9s)]
*  So for once I wanted to start fresh, man. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8625.74s)]
*  I looked at it, what I needed to do. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8627.54s)]
*  Everybody kept asking me, did you quit comedy? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8630.220000000001s)]
*  No, no, I'm just taking a fucking breather. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8632.02s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with taking a breather. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8635.140000000001s)]
*  Just taking a fucking extended breather. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8636.7s)]
*  I wanna know what the fuck happened the last 40 years. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8638.78s)]
*  Is that okay? [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8641.94s)]
*  I started this journey in 1983 and all of a sudden, 2020, [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8643.460000000001s)]
*  I'm at the store with a bunch of fucking killers. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8647.78s)]
*  I wasn't pre-programmed for this. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8650.220000000001s)]
*  I was pre-programmed to be in jail by now. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8651.66s)]
*  What am I doing at the store [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8654.18s)]
*  with a bunch of fucking killers doing comedy? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8655.26s)]
*  And they're talking to me and we're laughing. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8657.34s)]
*  It's not like I didn't earn it. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8658.9s)]
*  It's not like my mother owned the fucking joint [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8660.3s)]
*  and she just gave me a spot there. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8662.18s)]
*  We earned those things. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8663.98s)]
*  What the fuck happened? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8665.9s)]
*  I was a guy that was in prison. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8667.46s)]
*  They told me it's not gonna work out for you. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8668.98s)]
*  And here we are today. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8672.3s)]
*  So I had to go process this shit. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8673.38s)]
*  I had to go process a lot of fucking things. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8677.019999999999s)]
*  When I was a kid and my mother died, [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8679.82s)]
*  I had to lie to myself, Joe. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8681.619999999999s)]
*  Right in front of you. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8683.02s)]

*  Oh shit. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8687.3s)]
*  Sorry, I got no glasses. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8688.14s)]
*  You know, when I was a kid, I had to lie to myself. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8689.3s)]
*  When my mother died, I had to say, [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8692.46s)]
*  she's just leaving for a couple of years. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8693.74s)]
*  That's the only way I could deal with it. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8696.939999999999s)]
*  She's just going away for a couple of years. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8698.74s)]
*  I'll bump into her in a couple of years. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8700.82s)]
*  I'll bump into her in a couple of years. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8702.58s)]
*  When I went back to Jersey, dog, it hit me. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8704.3s)]
*  Like I lied to myself all those fucking years. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8707.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a coping mechanism, right? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8709.5s)]
*  It was a coping mechanism I used [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8710.94s)]
*  just to soothe my fucking soul. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8712.5s)]
*  I got back to Jersey, I went up to the cemetery one day, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8715.7s)]
*  and I go, what the fuck is this? [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8717.980000000001s)]
*  She never came back. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8720.62s)]
*  And I was like pissed about it, like retarded, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8722.140000000001s)]
*  like she never made a comeback. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8723.86s)]
*  And I'm like, Joey, what the fuck did you do? [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8725.980000000001s)]
*  You buried yourself in that shit that she was gonna, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8728.9s)]
*  you were gonna bump into her one day [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8731.5s)]
*  on Bergenland Avenue, or some shit, you know? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8732.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8735.86s)]
*  So that was hard, you know, a lot of things. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8736.7s)]
*  It's good to take a break off comedy [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8738.980000000001s)]
*  just to really try to figure out [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8740.38s)]
*  what your actual perspective really is. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8742.58s)]
*  Listen, bro, I was in an environment that I don't thrive in. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8744.3s)]
*  I was in an environment with a lot of fake motherfuckers. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8748.74s)]
*  I was in an environment where I did time. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8751.46s)]
*  I grew up around people who were very dangerous. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8754.699999999999s)]
*  The people I was around in LA were more dangerous [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8757.38s)]
*  because I knew where I stand with these other people. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8760.259999999998s)]
*  With these people in LA, these agents, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8763.42s)]
*  you don't know where you stand. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8765.3s)]
*  You have no fucking idea. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8766.98s)]
*  Well, you kind of know what they are. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8769.24s)]
*  You know what they are. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8771.12s)]
*  You know, it's like, that's that old Mike Tyson expression. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8772.12s)]
*  It's okay to have a snake in the room [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8774.640000000001s)]
*  as long as you keep the lights on. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8776.04s)]
*  You know what they are. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8779.2s)]
*  You know, you just have to know who you are. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8780.320000000002s)]
*  And I think you were coming from this place [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8782.24s)]
*  where you almost felt like you didn't belong, you know? [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8784.16s)]
*  And I remember when I first met you, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8787.68s)]
*  those Joey criminal days, it was fun, man. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8791.12s)]
*  Because I remember I met you and I was like, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8794.800000000001s)]
*  oh, finally, there's someone like people that I used to know. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8796.84s)]
*  Like, you were like the first guy that I ran into, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8800.68s)]
*  like, oh, this is like Joey from the Poo Hall. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8802.56s)]
*  This is like Joey from the boxing gym. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8805.48s)]
*  This is like, you were like the people [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8807.04s)]
*  that I knew from the East Coast, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8808.44s)]
*  the wild people that were fun, you know? [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8810.12s)]
*  And, you know, people didn't like you. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8812.4s)]
*  People were scared of you. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8815.24s)]
*  I was like, that guy's great. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8816.52s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of funny over the years [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8819.16s)]
*  because I had arguments with agents about you. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8821.84s)]
*  They're like, he doesn't have any talent. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8824.880000000001s)]
*  I'm like, you're out of your fucking mind. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8825.96s)]
*  I'm like, you're out of your mind. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8827.96s)]
*  I go, I know what comedy is, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8828.8s)]
*  and he makes me laugh harder than anybody I've ever seen. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8830.119999999999s)]
*  So he's wild and crazy. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8832.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you get. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8834.599999999999s)]
*  That's the kind of person [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8835.759999999998s)]
*  that does that kind of comedy, stupid. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8836.599999999999s)]
*  You don't even know what you sell. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8838.759999999998s)]
*  You're out here selling comedy. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8840.56s)]
*  You don't even know how it's created. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8841.8s)]
*  It's created by wild people, [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8843.08s)]
*  whether it's wild intellectually, wild physically, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8845.56s)]
*  just a different group of people [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8849.519999999999s)]
*  that are gonna create something [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8851.279999999999s)]
*  that's gonna make you laugh that hard. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8852.439999999999s)]
*  You know, man, it was fucking crazy [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8854.48s)]
*  those first couple years there, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8856.68s)]
*  and how people would look at me. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8858.76s)]
*  I remember one day an agent stole a check from me, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8859.88s)]
*  and I said, I'm gonna come down and get it. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8862.64s)]
*  When I got there, the door was shut, [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8863.92s)]
*  and he stuck the check on the fucking wall [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8865.64s)]
*  and said, don't come in here. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8868.8s)]
*  Then 10 years later, he signed me again. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8869.72s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8872.4s)]
*  I bumped into him at a vet place when we were talking. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8873.24s)]
*  He goes, I'll come back. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8874.56s)]
*  That's funny. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8875.96s)]
*  I had a hard time there for a long time. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8876.8s)]
*  Well, you were raw, man. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8878.24s)]
*  You were a raw dude. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8879.68s)]
*  Gotta be. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8880.8s)]
*  You reminded me a lot of my friend, Johnny. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8881.64s)]
*  Because Johnny was like you, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8885.08s)]
*  who was like a brilliant guy [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8886.4s)]
*  that struggled with substances. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8887.92s)]
*  Brilliant guy. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8890.96s)]
*  Johnny was like one of the smartest people I'd ever met. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8891.92s)]
*  He was a pool hustler. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8893.96s)]
*  And so I didn't know anybody like, [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8895.199999999999s)]
*  like, just a dangerous dude. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8896.68s)]
*  Just always doing wild shit. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8900.279999999999s)]
*  And I didn't know anybody like that over here [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8902.199999999999s)]
*  until I met you. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8904.119999999999s)]
*  And then I met you, I was like, oh, all right. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8904.96s)]
*  Because in comedy, we were getting a lot of people [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8907.44s)]
*  that were essentially auditioning for sitcoms. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8910.16s)]
*  They just, what they wanted to do is figure out a way [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8912.8s)]
*  to transfer what they're doing on stage [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8915.679999999998s)]
*  into a lucrative sitcom. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8918.84s)]
*  Everybody wanted that. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8921.039999999999s)]
*  That was the golden ring. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8922.0s)]
*  Everybody wanted the sitcom. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8923.4s)]
*  And everybody wanted a development deal. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8925.84s)]
*  So a lot of guys really only had 10, 15 minutes. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8927.64s)]
*  And that 15 minutes was just them sort of like setting up [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8930.119999999999s)]
*  their life for a sitcom. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8933.56s)]
*  It was almost like they told you where they were from. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8935.759999999998s)]
*  I was born in Brooklyn, New York, and this and that. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8938.8s)]
*  And they're basically like doing an audition [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8940.6s)]
*  for a sitcom on stage. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8942.720000000001s)]
*  We weren't doing that. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8943.880000000001s)]
*  We were doing a different thing. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8944.720000000001s)]
*  We were doing a different thing. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8945.56s)]
*  We were doing what we were doing, [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8946.4s)]
*  what our idols were doing. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8947.84s)]
*  We were doing what Prior did. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8949.28s)]
*  We were doing what Kinnison did. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8950.48s)]
*  We were trying to find our path with what we think. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8951.68s)]
*  I didn't appreciate that when people said [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8954.56s)]
*  you have to present the set on stage [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8956.32s)]
*  that the agents could see a network TV show. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8958.32s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8961.32s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you something else too. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8962.6s)]
*  When I get this residency, when I start kicking with gas, [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8964.6s)]
*  with comedy again, not podcasting no more. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8967.24s)]
*  Never again. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8971.24s)]
*  I'm ending this career as a standup. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8973.44s)]
*  But you can do both. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8975.52s)]
*  I don't wanna do both. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8977.24s)]
*  You don't like it? [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8978.08s)]
*  I wanna end this career as a fucking standup. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8979.52s)]
*  But you are a standup. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8982.72s)]
*  No, all this other shit. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8983.68s)]
*  No podcast. Ads and all this shit. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8986.279999999999s)]
*  No ads. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8987.88s)]
*  Let's do the last two years. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8988.72s)]
*  Fucking standup motherfuckers. [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8990.96s)]
*  That's why I wanna do the residency. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8993.199999999999s)]
*  That's why, because I'm ready just to do standup. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8994.64s)]
*  My phone ain't ringing or acting. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=8998.4s)]

*  and a little bit of the belly room. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9030.36s)]
*  It's like the belly room had sex with the OR [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9031.2s)]
*  and it created the little boy. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9033.52s)]

*  and created the big boy or fat man. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9037.84s)]
*  The big room is like a combination [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9041.76s)]
*  of the main room and the OR. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9043.720000000001s)]

*  Like some other club chains and shit. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9063.76s)]

*  He was on fire. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9288.36s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9289.44s)]

*  And that show is different every night. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9315.6s)]
*  You can go to two shows in a row. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9318.36s)]
*  You're not gonna see the same show. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9320.08s)]
*  It's a totally different show. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9321.24s)]

*  but he's also super supportive if you're good. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9356.56s)]
*  And it's a great platform for standup [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9359.32s)]
*  because there's no woke bullshit. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9363.039999999999s)]

*  There's no fucking playing and pandering. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9368.039999999999s)]

*  And he goes, okay, you got to showcase. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9480.039999999999s)]
*  We'll let you know when. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9481.72s)]
*  Two weeks later, he called me. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9483.2s)]

*  First set, watched me, came off, shook her hand. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9495.0s)]
*  Thank you for the opportunity. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9498.32s)]
*  I thought I was gonna pass out. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9499.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9501.119999999999s)]
*  I thought I was gonna pass out. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9501.96s)]
*  Because in my mind, it was this [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9503.6s)]
*  while I was going back to being a criminal. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9505.64s)]
*  Well, what she liked about guys like you though, [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9507.52s)]
*  is that you were raw. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9509.48s)]
*  She liked raw people with talent. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9511.119999999999s)]
*  That was her favorite thing. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9514.119999999999s)]
*  She didn't like people when they had already made it. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9515.119999999999s)]
*  She didn't like, she told Seinfeld, [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9517.52s)]
*  this place is not for you. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9519.0s)]
*  Seinfeld was too big already. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9520.4s)]
*  She's like, nah, this place is not for you. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9521.68s)]
*  She's a wild lady, man, in that regard. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9523.68s)]
*  And that's what I do. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9526.8s)]
*  Whenever I miss her, I think about her, I call Paulie. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9527.64s)]
*  Whenever I think of Mitzi, I call Paulie. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9530.52s)]
*  I'm thinking about your mom, brother. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9532.6s)]
*  It's fun being in the bar downstairs [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9534.0s)]
*  that's named after his mom. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9536.56s)]
*  So we're in Mitzi's, and there's a photo of Mitzi, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9538.0s)]
*  just like that. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9541.08s)]
*  Like that painting that we have on the wall in here. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9543.08s)]
*  She saved my life, brother. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9545.08s)]
*  I had no chance of being an adult. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9547.44s)]
*  No chance of ever doing anything in my life. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9550.92s)]
*  No chance until I walked into that fucking comedy club, [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9553.92s)]
*  and she made me a regular. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9557.36s)]
*  And when I went back the next week, [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9558.8s)]
*  and I had 10 minutes, and she was like, [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9560.08s)]
*  you're a regular calling Monday for spots? [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9563.0s)]
*  Dog, I didn't know what to do. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9565.12s)]
*  But I knew that if I kept my nose clean, [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9567.32s)]
*  but I knew I only had like a year or two [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9569.28s)]
*  before something happens. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9571.72s)]
*  I hit somebody with a chair, or I steal something. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9572.72s)]
*  That was my MO. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9576.160000000002s)]
*  But her putting me in there made me go, okay. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9577.68s)]
*  And it was me, Holtzman, you. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9583.28s)]
*  We had some fucking savages there in the beginning. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9585.880000000001s)]
*  But if you really think about my life, [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9588.52s)]
*  I got all the great things out of my life [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9590.960000000001s)]
*  in the Comedy Store. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9592.76s)]
*  Everything, my daughter, everything, our friendship. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9594.240000000002s)]
*  Everything, what didn't I get from the Comedy Store? [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9597.68s)]
*  We had a family there. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9600.0s)]
*  I got a life, man. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9601.28s)]
*  Yeah, it was a very special place for all of us. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9602.12s)]
*  I look at the pictures at night, [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9605.44s)]
*  because they post them on Facebook of the club, [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9606.68s)]
*  the mothership from the night before, [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9609.88s)]
*  and they show the, not when they show you fucking [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9611.32s)]
*  momos on stage, but when they show the staff working there. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9614.68s)]
*  When I see that young staff, I remember the great times [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9618.68s)]
*  we had on New Year's Eve and Christmas. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9622.08s)]
*  And it was a family. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9624.96s)]
*  Gave a fuck about a Christmas tree [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9626.56s)]
*  when you're a regular at the store. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9628.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9630.16s)]
*  Who wasn't at the, and now they close on Christmas Eve [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9631.0s)]
*  and Christmas Day. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9633.64s)]
*  But I still remember having a spot on Christmas Day [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9635.68s)]
*  and going, people are like, what type of animal are you? [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9637.400000000001s)]
*  Fuck, it's Comedy Store. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9639.880000000001s)]
*  We both did spots on Christmas Day. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9641.400000000001s)]
*  I did them. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9643.12s)]
*  I always did. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9643.960000000001s)]
*  I always did spots on Christmas Day. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9644.800000000001s)]
*  Dog, I ate a bag of mushrooms once on Thanksgiving [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9645.640000000001s)]
*  and went up there, and the fucking purple lights had me. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9649.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how many sets [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9652.52s)]
*  I did in the original room. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9654.640000000001s)]
*  But now looking at it, if it wasn't for Mitchie Shaw, [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9656.36s)]
*  because I would have left in six months. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9659.880000000001s)]
*  And my job was, my goal at that time [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9661.44s)]
*  was if I fail in LA, I'm driving back, [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9664.28s)]
*  I'm gonna make a pit stop, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9667.400000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna stab a few people in Colorado, [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9668.480000000001s)]
*  and then I'm going back to New York to hide. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9670.800000000001s)]
*  That was my plan. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9672.880000000001s)]
*  That was my plan if failure would have came in LA [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9673.720000000001s)]
*  and I would have got thrown out of there. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9677.24s)]
*  Well, I remember when you cracked the code. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9679.12s)]
*  And you're a guy that I've always said, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9681.800000000001s)]
*  you were the funniest guy in the parking lot. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9684.0s)]
*  And there was something that was missing in translation [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9687.24s)]
*  between you being the funny guy in the parking lot [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9689.68s)]
*  and you being the guy on stage. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9691.68s)]
*  And you just figured it out one day. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9693.64s)]
*  It's like one day you figured it out. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9695.84s)]
*  It was very interesting. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9697.56s)]
*  Becoming yourself. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9698.88s)]
*  Yeah, because you were trying to do jokes before. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9699.92s)]
*  You were trying to do stand-up the way stand-ups do jokes. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9704.279999999999s)]
*  And something happened. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9707.92s)]
*  I think it was a certain level of, [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9709.64s)]
*  I don't give a fuck anymore. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9711.599999999999s)]
*  Where too many agents had lied to you, [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9713.24s)]
*  too many auditions had fell through, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9715.0s)]
*  too many this, too many that. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9716.76s)]
*  And you're like, what am I trying to make [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9718.4s)]
*  these people happy for? [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9719.519999999999s)]
*  And you just were yourself on stage. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9720.72s)]
*  You'd almost like given up hope [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9724.08s)]
*  of the bullshit golden ring. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9725.400000000001s)]
*  I never understood writing shit [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9730.24s)]
*  that had nothing to do with you. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9732.2s)]
*  You gotta write shit that's close to your fucking heart [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9734.400000000001s)]
*  and your balls. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9736.560000000001s)]
*  I always wanted to be fucking somebody else sometimes. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9739.6s)]
*  I wish I wasn't dirty. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9743.04s)]
*  I wish I was a better joke writer. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9744.2s)]
*  I wish so many things. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9745.84s)]
*  But what I was doing, [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9747.52s)]
*  a lot of those guys that are straight traditional stand-up, [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9749.12s)]
*  which they were doing. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9752.68s)]
*  That guy that we keep forgetting with the dreadlocks, [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9753.76s)]
*  AJ. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9756.04s)]

*  Just pop it. Let's look him up. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9760.6s)]
*  Let's see where he's at. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9761.44s)]

*  AJ Jamal. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9763.84s)]
*  And I remember that dude, he used to bother you [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9764.68s)]
*  because he was so, there he is. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9766.84s)]

*  That's not really his? [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9788.52s)]
*  I don't know, I was just looking for something. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9789.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's him. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9790.64s)]

*  No, no, no, no, no. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9798.64s)]
*  It bothered you that he was so clean [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9800.279999999999s)]
*  that you weren't clean and made you self-conscious. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9802.24s)]
*  I remember you used to tell me about that. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9804.32s)]
*  I hated going on after that guy. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9805.48s)]
*  He would bury me. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9806.96s)]
*  He would kill and he'd be cleaning. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9807.8s)]
*  He would bury me. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9808.8s)]
*  Him and Dom Herrera made a habit of burying me. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9809.64s)]
*  And Dom made a habit of rubbing it in my face afterwards. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9812.519999999999s)]
*  Dom was brutal to me in those days. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9815.84s)]
*  Yeah, but he was just being dumb. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9818.16s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was being a fucking great guy. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9819.24s)]
*  You know, no, but not that I didn't like. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9821.08s)]
*  I just thought that how the fuck is somebody this clean [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9823.679999999998s)]
*  and technical so fucking good. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9826.32s)]
*  He was very technical. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9829.64s)]
*  He was like, if it was Jiu Jitsu, [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9831.519999999999s)]
*  you gotta hold under the elbow, [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9833.64s)]
*  he would be right there with that elbow. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9834.84s)]
*  Not an inch up, not an inch down. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9836.800000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9838.56s)]
*  He just knew his boundaries. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9839.64s)]
*  And that's what I always wanted to be. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9841.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9843.52s)]
*  But after a while, [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9844.36s)]
*  it was what I became in that original room. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVaV1N0pal0&t=9846.12s)]
