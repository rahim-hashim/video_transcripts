*  I love that chain. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=0.0s)]
*  Where's that chain? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=12.8s)]
*  My tattoo. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=15.76s)]
*  It's my logo. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=16.76s)]
*  American badass. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=17.76s)]
*  That's pretty badass. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=18.76s)]
*  That sounds like stoner talk. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=19.76s)]
*  It is. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=23.84s)]
*  It is stoner talk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=24.84s)]
*  Most of my conversations are stoner talk. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=25.84s)]
*  Like high level. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Dude, I used to be Tom Petty's weed dealer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=29.799999999999997s)]
*  In a sense. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=31.84s)]
*  Like he would come to town. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=33.839999999999996s)]
*  He married a girl from Saginaw, Michigan. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  I forget her name. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=36.839999999999996s)]
*  Great, great girl. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  And they would come to outside Detroit where I lived and I'd get this call like, hey, can [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=39.8s)]
*  you get Tom some weed? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=44.12s)]
*  And I'd be like, fuck, I'll take him some weed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  So I'd call some of my brother's friends and get some weed. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=49.36s)]
*  And I'd be like, this is fucking awesome because I love Tom Petty. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=51.959999999999994s)]
*  I didn't really know him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=55.4s)]
*  So I'd go up there and drop the weed off. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=56.98s)]
*  And I'd be in his dressing room and like, he'd be like, so what's up, man? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=58.5s)]
*  I'd be like, nothing. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, we have nothing in common. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=65.46s)]
*  This guy's so fucking high. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=67.38s)]
*  I might have been tuned up on a couple beers or something. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=68.94s)]
*  I'm like, well, that sucked. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=72.38s)]
*  I guess I'll just enjoy the music. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=75.14s)]
*  Was this before or after you were doing music? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=78.74s)]
*  Oh, it was when I was a big star. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=80.78s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=83.25999999999999s)]
*  No shit. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was all excited. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=85.25999999999999s)]
*  You were hanging with Tom Petty. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=86.34s)]
*  Not really. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=87.34s)]
*  I was just taking weed, trying to hang out with him. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=88.34s)]
*  You know, that's how Tom Petty died. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=91.02000000000001s)]
*  Somebody got him some pills. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=93.54s)]
*  Oh, is it fentanyl? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=94.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=96.54s)]
*  Fuck, fuck, fuck. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=97.54s)]
*  Yeah, he, I don't remember what his injury was, but he was hurting. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=98.54s)]
*  And a roadie got him some fentanyl. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=103.5s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=106.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=107.94s)]
*  That's how Prince died too. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=108.94s)]
*  Yeah, I remember. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=109.94s)]
*  I've heard that in the elevator. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=110.94s)]
*  Same thing, pain. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=111.94s)]
*  We all know people that have, it's a travesty. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=113.5s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=116.22s)]
*  Well, let's just go right at the border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=117.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=119.5s)]
*  Well, it's the border, but it's also the opioid crisis that was created by the Sackler family. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=120.5s)]
*  I mean, those motherfuckers just got a giant percentage of the population hooked on heroin. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=124.86s)]
*  It's some evil shit, man. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=132.5s)]
*  Those fucking people are still running around too. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=135.74s)]
*  Yeah, in case you were ever thinking about quitting drugs, fentanyl should seal the deal. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=137.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=144.34s)]
*  I know a lot of people it has. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=146.34s)]
*  They were like, you know, I was still an experimental cocaine user, this, that, and the other. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=147.94s)]
*  They were like, when that shit came up, that was it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=151.86s)]
*  It's like, you know, I had some friends tell me they were going to buy a testing kit, this, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=155.02s)]
*  that, and the other. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that's probably time to move on. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  If you're buying a testing kit to make sure you don't die, you probably should reconsider [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=161.94s)]
*  your options. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=166.18s)]
*  Might want to revisit whiskey. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=167.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=169.02s)]
*  Weed's not bad. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=170.02s)]
*  Weed and whiskey are, it's a good combination. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  You don't really, you don't want to go down that road. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=174.26s)]
*  Although I've heard it's awesome. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=176.82s)]
*  Not fentanyl, but cocaine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=179.17999999999998s)]
*  I have not tried it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=180.89999999999998s)]
*  I've never done it, but everyone I know who does it tells you not to do it because it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=181.89999999999998s)]
*  awesome. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=185.5s)]
*  I had a good run. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=186.5s)]
*  I haven't had too many problems. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=187.5s)]
*  You know, in the older days, you know, it's kind of just following the handbook of rock [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=190.5s)]
*  and roll. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=197.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=198.82s)]
*  It's like your chapter 14 gets some blow. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=199.82s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=202.01999999999998s)]
*  We had fun. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  I've seen people get all fucked up and lose their minds on it, but I know quite a few [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=204.78s)]
*  people in my position like, okay, we had some fun. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=209.66s)]
*  We were younger and you know, at some point, you know, kind of a weekend warrior type thing. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=212.58s)]
*  Don't let it interfere with business and engagements and things you have to do. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=217.18s)]
*  Can't say I was batting a thousand, but pretty good average. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=220.86s)]
*  You did pretty good considering it all worked out pretty well. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=224.22s)]
*  I'm not advocating for it at any level. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=228.9s)]
*  I don't think anybody is. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  That's my honest experience. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=232.66s)]
*  Like, hey, you know, I came out okay. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=233.66s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=236.14s)]
*  There's people that will tell you they're weed advocates. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=237.14s)]
*  There's no like coke advocates. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=239.14s)]
*  There's no people like coke fix my life. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=240.9s)]
*  I never got anything done. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=246.42s)]
*  All of a sudden I was doing coke and starting businesses. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=247.94s)]
*  Is weed fixing lives? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=250.26s)]
*  We can fix people. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=252.1s)]
*  It depends on who you are. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=253.1s)]
*  I know if you're sick and yeah, for a guy like me, weed's a good drug. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=254.54s)]

*  I'm a little nervous and I'm tuned up already. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=281.74s)]
*  Yeah, for some people, weed makes you nicer, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=285.82s)]
*  calms you down, makes you a little more sensitive, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=289.14s)]

*  He said, I'm getting married. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=384.06s)]

*  Because if people listen to what he says, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=407.94s)]

*  I'll be like, that's so un-gay. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=435.22s)]
*  Yeah, it used to be a thing that we would say. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=438.82s)]
*  Something's gay. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=441.62s)]
*  Or it used to be, imagine from the time of the Flintstones. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=442.38s)]
*  The Flintstones was we had a gay old time. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=446.38s)]

*  What is it? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=452.7s)]
*  You give somebody the football, and everyone tries to tackle him. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=453.14s)]
*  Like in grade school, you just ran around. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=455.7s)]
*  We didn't even know what queer meant. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=457.5s)]
*  That's the name of the game was smear the queer. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=458.82s)]
*  I never played that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=461.62s)]

*  There you go. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=468.5s)]
*  They didn't have that where I grew up. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=469.9s)]
*  Where'd you grow up? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=472.74s)]
*  Boston. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=473.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they had it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=475.62s)]
*  Fuck, I would think it was invented in Boston. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=476.86s)]
*  I lived a fucked up life. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=480.82s)]
*  Not fucked up, but my high school years [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=482.86s)]
*  was all martial arts. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=485.98s)]
*  It was all from the time I was 15 until I was 21. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=487.14s)]
*  All I did is train and compete. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=490.53999999999996s)]
*  That's a lot of discipline. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=492.62s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of obsession. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=493.82s)]
*  A lot of discipline and obsession, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=495.7s)]
*  but it was very weird socially. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=497.06s)]
*  So it went from that to being a stand up comedian, which [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=500.41999999999996s)]
*  is the complete opposite ends of the spectrum. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=502.7s)]
*  Hanging out with maniacs who were doing drugs [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=505.34s)]
*  and staying up all night. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=507.62s)]
*  Just complete polar opposite. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=508.94s)]
*  So I missed a lot of stuff. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=512.22s)]
*  You got a lot of money now you can make up for it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=514.54s)]
*  Fast track it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=517.0600000000001s)]
*  Probably get it all done in two years [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=519.02s)]
*  with the loot you've made. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=520.98s)]
*  I found that to be a problem at times for people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=525.26s)]
*  Money? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=527.9s)]
*  No. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=528.5s)]
*  They didn't experience a certain coming of age things, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=529.02s)]
*  whether it's crazy chasing girls, that whole thing, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=532.1800000000001s)]
*  doing drugs, just being kind of wild, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=536.34s)]
*  stealing people's statues out of the yard, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=539.0600000000001s)]
*  whatever crazy shit like that you do when you're young. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=540.78s)]
*  And then they reached this point. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=543.74s)]
*  And they laugh at it with athletes [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=544.82s)]
*  because they were so focused in their training [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=546.1s)]
*  at such a young age. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  And then they get to that point where they get money [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=549.58s)]
*  and they're like, I want to taste it all. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=551.58s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=554.62s)]
*  And then they kind of get fucked up. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=555.22s)]
*  Yeah, you can lose your bearings. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=556.82s)]
*  That's true. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=558.74s)]
*  That is the case with a lot of athletes. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=560.0200000000001s)]
*  A lot of athletes get fat too. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=562.1800000000001s)]
*  They just fuck it. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=563.7800000000001s)]
*  It's over. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=564.5400000000001s)]
*  A lot of fighters. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  A lot of fighters are always dieting. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=566.7s)]
*  Well, you get that big muscle and it's so hard to fucking [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=568.62s)]
*  maintain as you get older. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=571.7800000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=573.4200000000001s)]
*  You lose your lean muscle. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=573.94s)]
*  You know about all that stuff. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=575.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=577.4200000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, two to 10 beers a night [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=577.94s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  Well, it's also like, I think with athletes, especially [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=583.5400000000001s)]
*  with fighters, the rush of competition [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=586.3800000000001s)]
*  is so extreme that the regular world just seems so dull. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=589.9000000000001s)]
*  And then going back to the regular world, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=594.6600000000001s)]
*  you don't feel like you have a real purpose anymore. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=596.4200000000001s)]
*  You're not training for this big event that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=598.34s)]
*  takes place every few months. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=600.1800000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=605.14s)]

*  Big problem. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=608.38s)]
*  Huge suicide just unbelievable. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=609.18s)]
*  And no coaching at all. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=610.4599999999999s)]
*  Nobody tells you what to do. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  They just let you back in the world and you're like, fuck. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=613.2199999999999s)]

*  Too many times. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=621.2199999999999s)]
*  So what's it like being the dude who took out Bud Light? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=622.54s)]
*  Let's get right to it. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=627.5s)]
*  Let's get right to it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=628.5s)]
*  We were going to bring a few cases in here for you. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=629.54s)]
*  Switch sunglasses. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=632.02s)]
*  Fuck, I'll drink it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=632.86s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=633.7s)]
*  Two kinds of beer in this world, cold and free. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=634.9s)]
*  I like them both. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=637.26s)]
*  Man, I was just having fun, to be honest with you. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=640.74s)]
*  I mean, I was pissed. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=643.42s)]
*  But it wasn't like it was going to wreck my day, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=645.74s)]
*  yet alone my life. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=648.86s)]
*  I was just kind of like, what the fuck are they doing? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=649.86s)]
*  But you were the straw that broke the camel's back. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=651.74s)]
*  I became the face of it, yes. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=654.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm not the Pied Piper to sit around and think people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=656.98s)]
*  follow what Kid Rock does. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=659.3000000000001s)]
*  I just became the face of it. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=660.62s)]
*  Yeah, but they kind of do. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=662.06s)]
*  They kind of do. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=663.78s)]
*  Listen, man, when you got so upset that you were fucking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=664.9399999999999s)]
*  machine gunning. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=668.3399999999999s)]
*  Throwing a tantrum with a machine gun. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=669.26s)]
*  Weee. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=671.02s)]
*  Weee. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=673.02s)]
*  You machine gunned cases of Bud Light. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=673.8599999999999s)]
*  They want all the guys playing girl sports. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=676.18s)]
*  Weee. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=678.0999999999999s)]
*  That was the end. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=680.0999999999999s)]
*  That was really it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=681.42s)]
*  If there's one moment that they look back on and fucking go, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=682.6999999999999s)]
*  shit. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=685.9799999999999s)]
*  I've talked to them about it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=687.5s)]
*  I know you have. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=688.8599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=689.8199999999999s)]
*  You were there at the UFC fight. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=691.02s)]
*  Yeah, and I met that dude. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=692.18s)]
*  The CEO. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=693.22s)]
*  He's a good guy, man. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=693.98s)]
*  We've become friends. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=694.9s)]
*  He's a good guy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=695.86s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=697.22s)]
*  After five minutes of talking to him, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=697.98s)]
*  I'm with Trump there in Dana's green room. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=700.5s)]
*  I go to Trump. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=703.14s)]
*  I go, see that dude behind me? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=703.78s)]
*  I go, that's the CEO of Bud Light or Anheuser-Busch. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=705.46s)]
*  And Trump's like, you want to go talk to him? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=709.42s)]
*  Which in my mind, Trump said, you want to go fuck with him? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=711.26s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, absolutely. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=716.1s)]
*  So we go over there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=718.54s)]
*  We're talking to him. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=719.54s)]
*  Actually, great conversation. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=720.5s)]
*  And at some point, he was telling me how he got the video. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=721.9s)]
*  And he was actually down in Texas doing some hunting. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=724.66s)]
*  And I'm like, we talk and talk. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=727.4599999999999s)]
*  And I'm not going to share all our conversation. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=729.4599999999999s)]
*  That'd probably be inappropriate. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=731.54s)]
*  But I'm like, dude, you seem like somebody [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  I'd fucking be friends with that I'd hang out with. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=735.86s)]
*  He's like, you would. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=737.9s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=738.9s)]
*  And I'm like, I'll come to Nashville. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=740.06s)]
*  Come visit me. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=742.3s)]
*  He fucking did. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=743.54s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=744.74s)]
*  Came with his top team. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=745.3399999999999s)]
*  Fucking, we broke bread. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=747.26s)]
*  Got fucked up in Bud Light. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=748.9399999999999s)]
*  We're fucking bold. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=750.34s)]
*  Like, did all this fun shit. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=751.5s)]
*  And we had a good meeting beforehand, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=753.66s)]
*  trying to think if there's something I could do [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=755.5s)]
*  with Anheuser-Busch. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=757.4599999999999s)]
*  And I just didn't feel comfortable with it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=759.02s)]
*  I threw out some ideas that scared the living fuck out [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=763.18s)]
*  of them. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=766.5799999999999s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I was like, guys, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=767.6999999999999s)]
*  I don't feel right taking your money. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=769.62s)]
*  I was like, we can continue the conversation, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=771.18s)]
*  see where it ends up. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=774.54s)]
*  But honestly, I don't want any corporate deals. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=775.42s)]
*  I don't feel right. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=777.18s)]
*  There's not a penny on Earth that [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=777.9s)]
*  could make me change who I am or have people look at me [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=779.26s)]
*  in a different way, even though it's probably [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=782.4599999999999s)]
*  half the country at this point that likes me [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=784.86s)]
*  and other half wants to put a bullet in me. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=787.5799999999999s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=790.22s)]
*  There's no like, he's OK. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=791.18s)]
*  I've destroyed that. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=793.5799999999999s)]
*  There's no, Kid Rock's OK. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=794.98s)]
*  It's either I fucking hate that kid or I'll [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=796.5s)]
*  take a bullet for him. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=799.5s)]
*  But we still talk. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=801.22s)]
*  And that's a better place to be, honestly. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=802.86s)]
*  And like I said, you know what I mean? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=804.98s)]
*  They fucked up. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=806.42s)]
*  And when you get to the grassroots of it, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=807.34s)]
*  that's what they did. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=808.82s)]
*  And there's so many people that work for that company. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=809.7800000000001s)]
*  And you know all the stuff they've done. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=812.26s)]
*  We don't have to be a broken record here. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=813.38s)]
*  It's a great company. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=814.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  And they've done amazing things. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=816.38s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch is an amazing charitable company [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=817.62s)]
*  that do a lot of great things. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=820.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I dug into that. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=823.1s)]
*  And I was educated on it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=824.14s)]
*  Even before Dana called me about his deal and things [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=826.4200000000001s)]
*  like that, people discussed with me. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=828.62s)]
*  I did a little digging and talked to people. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=830.34s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I'm like, all right. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=832.4200000000001s)]
*  They got the message. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=834.46s)]
*  I'm not someone who holds a fucking grudge [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=835.78s)]
*  his whole life. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=837.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=838.26s)]
*  And honest to God, I was having a lot of fucking fun. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=839.06s)]
*  I don't get to pull my machine gun out [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=841.62s)]
*  and film myself doing cool shit too often. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=843.14s)]
*  I'm just not that type of person. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=845.5s)]
*  I was like, this warrants it right here. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=847.54s)]
*  Get all the Bud Light on property. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=852.18s)]
*  Those actually is all the beer I had on property. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=853.9s)]
*  I kept a lot of shit around, more than I thought. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=855.5799999999999s)]
*  We stopped selling it at the mothership [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=857.62s)]
*  because nobody's buying it. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=859.02s)]
*  It got that bad. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=860.5799999999999s)]
*  What's going on there? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=861.78s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=863.1s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=863.74s)]
*  I think it's stupid. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=864.5s)]
*  And Shane Gillis brought it back a lot. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=865.34s)]
*  I love Shane. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=867.1s)]
*  Shane's a buddy. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=867.98s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=868.58s)]
*  He brought it back a lot because he never stopped drinking it. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=869.86s)]
*  And it's slowly making its way back. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=873.22s)]
*  And I think the UFC helps a lot too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=877.58s)]
*  But they took a big hit. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=879.9s)]
*  One of the things I told them was I go from the outside [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=881.18s)]
*  looking in, guys, as a friend, somebody [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=884.66s)]
*  who doesn't want to see this brand hurt and destroyed [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=887.3s)]
*  anymore. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=890.14s)]
*  You got smacked on the ass. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=891.42s)]
*  In a pretty hard spanking. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=893.98s)]
*  I was like, but I don't want to hold your head underwater [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=895.5400000000001s)]
*  and drown this fucking company, put people out of work [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=897.22s)]
*  and that shit. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=899.5400000000001s)]
*  It's like, you got the message. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=900.1400000000001s)]
*  And it's clear. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=901.5400000000001s)]
*  I wish people knew these guys running the company [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=902.46s)]
*  because they're great fucking guys. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=904.94s)]
*  But I said, you know, there's just [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=906.7s)]
*  a percentage of these fucking trolls on the left [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=910.74s)]
*  and on the right. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=913.98s)]
*  They're like, I'm so empowered by the internet. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=915.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm going to piss and bitch and moan. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=918.34s)]
*  And I have a voice. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=919.9000000000001s)]
*  It's like, go fuck yourself. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=921.9000000000001s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=923.8199999999999s)]
*  Like, if anyone's still spending time on this, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=924.5s)]
*  you clearly are fucking bored. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=927.26s)]
*  Find something better to do. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=928.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely the pursuit of losers. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=930.14s)]
*  But the problem is those losers can actually [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=932.18s)]
*  affect businesses. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=933.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's what they know. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=935.2199999999999s)]
*  They know now that it's possible, both on the right [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=936.62s)]
*  and on the left. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=939.14s)]
*  But they need to know there's so many more businesses [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=939.78s)]
*  in this country deserving of that treatment. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=942.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=944.4599999999999s)]
*  Fucking Ben and Jerry, Starbucks, Target. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=944.98s)]
*  The list goes on and on. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=947.9399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=949.54s)]
*  And I don't care if they're left wing or right wing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=949.86s)]
*  It's just their fucking ideology. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=951.5s)]
*  Like, you know, when they cross that line and signal [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=953.3s)]
*  to people like myself and many others that they were OK [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=955.18s)]
*  with this transgender thing and more so at like, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=958.18s)]
*  is this going to get directed at my kids? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=961.26s)]
*  And you think fucking men should be in women's sports? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=963.14s)]
*  Like, no, no, no. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=965.9s)]
*  That's where I'm drawing the fucking line. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=967.02s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=968.6199999999999s)]
*  That's the most amazing one that they're reporting. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=969.54s)]
*  And the fact that was it the Olympic boxing committee? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=972.0999999999999s)]
*  What was it that just allowed transgender? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=974.9399999999999s)]
*  They're allowing the reverse. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=977.02s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=979.06s)]
*  They're allowing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=979.5s)]
*  I always get confused. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=980.8199999999999s)]
*  They're like, they're like, they're like chicks that's so on dicks [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=981.78s)]
*  to fight dudes, which I'd tune in for that. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=986.1s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=988.9s)]
*  I think so. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=989.9s)]
*  I thought it was biological men who identify as females [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=990.3s)]
*  were going to be allowed to box. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=994.22s)]
*  Might be. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=996.18s)]
*  I thought it was the other way, too, but I don't know. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=997.02s)]
*  Jamie will find out. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=998.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1000.4599999999999s)]
*  The other one was the other one's easy. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1001.3s)]
*  Sure. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1003.1s)]
*  You think, go ahead, do it, go for it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1003.6999999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you're going to have to take steroids. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1006.54s)]
*  And it's supposed to be illegal to take steroids. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1008.98s)]
*  Like if you are taking synthetic testosterone, you're taking steroids. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1011.14s)]
*  And if so, if you're doing that and you're becoming a man, do that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1016.74s)]
*  Who's to say that the men can't do it, too? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1021.22s)]
*  Like, it's just we even have to think that deep about it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1023.14s)]
*  You can't just look at it and go like, no, that's fucking wrong. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1025.58s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1027.74s)]
*  Well, it should 100 percent be wrong for biological males [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1028.46s)]
*  to compete against biological females. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1031.66s)]
*  That's just period. Period. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1033.54s)]
*  And any bullshit that you say like trans women or women. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1035.94s)]
*  Well, guess what? They're not. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1039.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not biologically. They're not. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1041.26s)]
*  They can identify as a woman. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1043.0600000000002s)]
*  You want to call yourself Sally. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1044.46s)]
*  I'll call you Sally. I'm a nice guy. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1045.74s)]
*  Policy states that minors under the 18 must compete in their birth gender. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1048.0600000000002s)]
*  In the weight class outlined in the rulebook, transgender women over 18 [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1052.8200000000002s)]
*  can only compete in the female category if they undergo genital reassignment surgery [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1056.8200000000002s)]
*  and submit to quarterly hormone tests for at least four years following surgery. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1061.8600000000001s)]
*  The guidelines which define normal range of testosterone [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1066.38s)]
*  see, but this is just it's still not good enough. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1068.98s)]
*  The people don't understand all the different. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1072.22s)]
*  Understand any of that. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1074.18s)]
*  I went into it deeply, unfortunately. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1076.0600000000002s)]
*  Transgender men over 18 have to meet similar requirements. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1078.7s)]
*  They must undergo genital reassignment. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1082.02s)]
*  Transgender men, general reassignment surgery. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1083.8200000000002s)]
*  So you have to get a fake dick. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1086.38s)]
*  You have to in order to box submit quarterly. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1089.14s)]
*  That sounds insane. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1092.18s)]
*  Are there donor dicks? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1093.18s)]
*  They should be. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1094.7s)]
*  Do you know they can't donate? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1096.1000000000001s)]
*  They are like a heart or something like that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1097.54s)]
*  Are there donor dicks? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1099.78s)]
*  They definitely do. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1100.74s)]
*  For guys who get their dicks blown off, they get them new dicks. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1101.54s)]
*  Are they switching like, hey, I want to be a man. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1103.6599999999999s)]
*  I want to be a woman. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1105.74s)]
*  I haven't heard of that yet, but I'm sure that's coming. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1106.86s)]
*  But what they do not do is they don't give you the balls. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1109.18s)]
*  Because if someone switches your balls, like say if you donate your balls, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1113.1s)]
*  you die in a car accident, you donate your balls to science or whatever, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1117.02s)]
*  and someone takes your balls and sews them on, that'll be your kids. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1119.8999999999999s)]
*  Your genes will come out of those balls. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1123.26s)]
*  So it won't be like a new person. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1126.7s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1129.42s)]
*  I mean, it won't be like this person's genes carrying on. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1130.7s)]
*  It'll be your genes carrying on through your balls that are attached to this guy. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1133.74s)]
*  So that's not ethical. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1137.8600000000001s)]
*  Why is this always like come up in conversations at the media? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1138.78s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't remember the last time like I seen it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1142.38s)]
*  And by the way, if you're transgender and you're really fucking good at it, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  no one knows. Right. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1149.5s)]
*  It's usually not the case. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1151.8600000000001s)]
*  Although the only time I've been around transgender people is like some crazy [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1153.02s)]
*  club like in Miami or New York back in the day. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1156.46s)]
*  And I guess it's fun. It was rare. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1159.22s)]
*  But I mean, you have those clubs where they were be a fucking blast. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1162.18s)]
*  No big deal. Like this America freedom, if you want to fucking be that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1164.7s)]
*  Go ahead. Like I'll exist with you in society. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1169.74s)]
*  Yeah, probably not getting the dinner invite. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1172.1s)]
*  But but, you know, if you're out and about like we can both shop in Walmart. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1174.34s)]
*  I'm not going to freak out. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1178.26s)]
*  If you're not fucking with me, I'm not fucking with you. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1179.42s)]
*  Yeah, no matter who you are. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1181.54s)]
*  And that's how it should be. Yeah, it's pretty simple. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1182.42s)]
*  It should be. It's common sense. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1184.02s)]
*  Yeah. You should be able to do whatever you want. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1185.18s)]
*  But when you want to compete as a woman or you want to start, you know, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1186.9s)]
*  if you're a 50 year old man, you want to compete against young girls, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1190.18s)]
*  which is what's going on in Canada. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1193.46s)]
*  There's a guy's 50 who identifies as a teenage girl. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1194.82s)]
*  They let him compete and swim meets with girls and change in the locker room with them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1197.78s)]
*  That's your now you're insane. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1202.06s)]
*  Now you're taking it too far. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1204.02s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1205.46s)]
*  No one's ever happy with us moving the goalposts a little bit. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1206.3s)]
*  They want to move them, reestablish, move them further, move them further, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1210.26s)]
*  move them for I had a thought about that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1214.34s)]
*  So I'm thinking like it's Black History Month, right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1216.98s)]
*  I can get down with that. That makes sense. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1220.26s)]
*  I think November is like Native American month. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1222.66s)]
*  I can get down with that. That makes sense. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1225.22s)]
*  Thing I'm struggling with is Pride Month and Veterans Day. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1227.94s)]
*  Right. The fucking balance there. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1233.54s)]
*  Yeah. I'm like, should we flip that? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1235.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. That's a real good point. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1238.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird time, man. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a weird time because there's like so many fucking weird people [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1244.02s)]
*  that are involved in promoting these things and pushing them [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1246.94s)]
*  and changing what's normal and what's not normal to regular people. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1250.5s)]
*  I just fucking weirdos and all this fucking mentally ill fucking nutcases. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1254.7s)]
*  That's why that's honestly why I carry a gun everywhere. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1258.62s)]
*  Where I'm legal to, I have somebody with me. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1261.46s)]
*  It used to be like, OK, if I'm going somewhere where I thought, you know, that would [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1264.1s)]
*  you know, make sense to do. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1268.06s)]
*  You know, I've always had a concealed weapons permit everywhere and whatnot. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1269.78s)]
*  I'm just gun enthusiast. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1273.82s)]
*  But in the last, I don't know how many years, five so many years, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1276.3s)]
*  it's like carry a fucking gun everywhere. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1280.26s)]
*  Just because just because of that, like just fucking people that are unstable. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1283.1399999999999s)]
*  You never know when these motherfuckers is going to lose it [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1287.42s)]
*  and you just sit in there defenseless. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1289.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's a strange time, man, in so many ways. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1292.94s)]
*  People are just I can imagine they were saying the same shit [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1297.3s)]
*  in like the 60s and 70s. They were, you know, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1300.78s)]
*  the 60s and 70s were fucked, too. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1303.74s)]
*  We just forgot because the 80s were so easy. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1305.46s)]
*  The 80s and the 90s were everyone was kind of coasting. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1308.22s)]
*  And then everyone was on blow. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1311.02s)]
*  There was a little bit of that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1313.46s)]
*  There's also the, you know, the Cold War ended [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1315.1s)]
*  this collapse of the Soviet Union. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1318.38s)]
*  We weren't worried. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1320.06s)]
*  There wasn't like this existential threat hanging over our heads. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1320.98s)]
*  Well, now it's back. Now it's back. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1323.94s)]
*  Yeah. Fun times. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1325.82s)]
*  We've done a 360. Fun times. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1327.26s)]

*  Unbelievable. Yeah. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1333.4199999999998s)]
*  I had no thought on that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1334.62s)]
*  I think I saw it on a T-shirt. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1336.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't take credit for everything I say, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1337.7s)]
*  because I'm most likely I'm just repeating something I saw somewhere. Right. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1339.06s)]
*  But it's like, you know, they want to do away with gas stoves, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1343.02s)]
*  make them electric, electric cars. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1346.26s)]
*  I want to start with that wall. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1348.54s)]
*  I can make that fucker electric, put up some solar panels. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1351.58s)]
*  Yeah. China built one how many thousands of years ago? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1355.9399999999998s)]

*  Well, it's a real weird thing, like what they're doing. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1366.26s)]
*  And there's so many different people that have opinions [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1368.62s)]
*  about why they're leaving it open and why they're allowing people to come in [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1370.26s)]
*  and, you know, setting them up. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1373.58s)]
*  And Dr. Phil was on here yesterday and he was talking about it. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1375.1799999999998s)]

*  Son's a good friend of mine. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1394.26s)]
*  But he's he's starting a network like he's just so fed up with the news [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1395.66s)]
*  and the way things are portrayed and these biased ways. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1401.26s)]
*  And he wants to have objective news. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1404.6200000000001s)]
*  And so he created the HR department. Yeah. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1406.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's a fucking very bizarre time. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1409.98s)]
*  And I'm sure it's going to get more bizarre. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1414.46s)]
*  We're going to look back on these days one day like, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1415.94s)]
*  oh, remember the good old days we just all you're complaining about [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1417.74s)]
*  was transgender women competing in sports. Yeah. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1420.46s)]
*  Kid only wanted to be a cat, took a litter box of school. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1423.94s)]
*  Fuck the good old days. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1426.94s)]
*  Yeah, people don't get better. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1430.06s)]
*  Society doesn't get better. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1431.7s)]
*  Just gets in less something happens, unless they figure out [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1433.3s)]
*  some sort of mind reading. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1436.74s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, usually that turns out to be tragedy. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1437.6999999999998s)]
*  Right. Something really fucked up happens, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1442.34s)]
*  you know, like what happened in Israel or worse. Right. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1445.02s)]
*  That tends to bring nations and people together on different levels. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1448.26s)]
*  Unlike 9-11, you know, 9-11. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1451.9399999999998s)]
*  When 9-11 happened, I tell everybody, like even in Los Angeles, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1455.1799999999998s)]
*  which is probably the most unpatriotic place on Earth, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1459.34s)]
*  everybody had an American flag on their car. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1461.82s)]
*  People are letting people in lanes. They were waving to people. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1464.34s)]
*  They were friendly. They felt united. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1467.3s)]
*  It was interesting. I remember. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1469.46s)]
*  Didn't last long. A few months. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1471.34s)]
*  Everybody, half the country didn't hate George W. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1473.4199999999998s)]
*  Bush for almost 48 hours. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1476.74s)]
*  They didn't hate him at all when he gave that one great speech. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1479.34s)]
*  No, I mean, it was it was a couple of weeks, a couple of months, whatever it was. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1482.18s)]
*  But then things kind of went back to normal. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1485.3s)]
*  There was a lot of liberals that liked him after that. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1487.3s)]
*  They were like, that's what you want when you're in times of war. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1489.62s)]
*  You want a strong leader. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1492.18s)]
*  That's too bad. We can't get to that without, you know, having something. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1493.5s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1497.3s)]
*  Well, if we could just have a little more civil discourse in this country, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1498.26s)]
*  you can go tell me to go fuck myself. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1500.98s)]
*  You hate Trump and my politics. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1502.8999999999999s)]
*  I may fuck you, but I'll still sit down and have a beer with you. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1504.98s)]
*  Like we don't have to have this fucking goddamn going for your throat. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1508.3s)]
*  And I'm part of the problem. I've been polarizing. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1511.5s)]
*  You know, no, no question. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1513.82s)]
*  My last album, that's what it was all about. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1515.06s)]
*  But a good portion of it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1516.5s)]

*  I watch ABC one night. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1900.02s)]
*  NBC. This is one. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1901.1799999999998s)]
*  This is just one example. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1903.26s)]
*  There's a million of them, as you know, but like they're talking about [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1904.54s)]
*  January 6th and they completely edit his speech. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1907.86s)]
*  They take out the part where he says, it's march down there peacefully or whatever. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1911.22s)]
*  He actually says that and they cut it out. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1915.22s)]
*  He says, we're going to march down the Capitol cut. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1917.6999999999998s)]
*  And then they go, if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1920.3s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, how the fuck do they get away with that? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1923.3s)]
*  They get away with it because they are the news. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1926.06s)]
*  And no one's checking them. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1928.34s)]
*  There's not another new. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1929.4599999999998s)]
*  If the news was real, the other news organizations would go, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1930.3799999999999s)]
*  this is horrible propaganda. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1934.02s)]
*  And what you've done is you've edited out a former president. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1937.1399999999999s)]
*  You've changed his words. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1940.86s)]
*  This should be illegal. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  You're taking it completely out of context. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1943.74s)]
*  The whole thing is so fucking screwball. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1946.86s)]
*  Every single presidential race we've ever had that I can remember, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1949.6999999999998s)]
*  people contested the results. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1955.02s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton did it. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1957.26s)]
*  And Stacey Abrams, they all know fucking big deal. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1959.34s)]
*  He didn't really win the election. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1962.54s)]
*  They all said there was Russian collusion. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1964.3s)]
*  They all said that he was essentially an agent of Russia. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1967.14s)]
*  They all said that he's an illegitimate president. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1970.42s)]
*  They all said that he didn't win the election. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1973.74s)]
*  They all said that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1976.18s)]
*  There was so many people that said it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1977.98s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1980.34s)]
*  Oh, pencil neck, fucking dick fuck Adam Schiff. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1981.3s)]
*  It's it's crazy how people still listen to those folks. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1985.78s)]
*  You know, it's crazy about that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1989.54s)]
*  How about that election? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1991.02s)]
*  I'm not a conspiracy guy or whatever, but I'm like, fucking, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1992.46s)]
*  that just seems like shenanigans. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1995.8999999999999s)]
*  I love when anybody says I'm not a conspiracy guy. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1997.62s)]
*  I mean, I'm a conspiracy. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=1999.86s)]
*  I'm a total fucking conspiracy guy. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2001.5s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2003.22s)]
*  I don't give a shit either way. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2005.46s)]
*  But I was like, there's so many fucking shenanigans that I just [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2006.82s)]
*  it's coming so fast with the covid shit and ballots all over the place. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2010.1s)]
*  You know, Secretary of State's are taking liberties, but here's my position. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2014.02s)]
*  Wait, let me finish this one. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2017.42s)]
*  It was it was that [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2018.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not telling you the Secretary of State's. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2020.8600000000001s)]
*  It was it was that OK, so these [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2023.22s)]
*  the biggest corporations on the face of the earth are getting hacked. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2026.46s)]
*  Right. But there's absolutely no way you can get in this election thing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2030.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm like, then why aren't these corporations using that technology? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2034.94s)]
*  Why are they still getting fucking hacked? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2039.02s)]
*  That doesn't just make up. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2041.26s)]
*  I just can't figure that out. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2042.78s)]
*  My fucking mind. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2043.86s)]
*  The thing the statement is, there's no evidence that they've been hacked. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2044.74s)]
*  It doesn't mean it. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2048.02s)]
*  It ain't a crime. Which is true. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2048.98s)]
*  It is true. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2050.58s)]
*  But there is evidence that you can hack those machines. Right. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2051.46s)]
*  And there isn't wasn't that, Jamie, the subject of they were going to update [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2055.42s)]
*  the machines in 2024 or something like that. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2059.02s)]
*  But they they're they're going to update them. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2062.74s)]
*  But they weren't at a certain point in time when they were recording this, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2065.3s)]
*  where they were reporting on this rather. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2069.42s)]
*  They they had it updated. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2071.62s)]
*  Here's my take on this. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2073.22s)]
*  A lot of election fraud is never zero. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2075.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not zero percent. Right. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2080.46s)]
*  We can all agree to that. Right. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2081.7799999999997s)]
*  I think we can all agree that there's people that are complete maniacs [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2083.38s)]
*  that are maniacs for the Democrats or maniacs for the Republicans. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2087.62s)]
*  And they will do whatever the fuck it takes to get their person to win. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2091.98s)]
*  There are certain human beings like that that exist, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2094.98s)]
*  especially in these like very polarized groups. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2097.54s)]
*  And especially when you've got a guy that you've been comparing to Hitler forever. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2100.7s)]
*  So you can kind of treat him as if Hitler's coming. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2105.98s)]
*  Let's stop Hitler. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2108.86s)]
*  Let's wait for literally. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2110.7s)]
*  You can think like that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2112.58s)]
*  You're doing it right now. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2113.82s)]
*  Think like that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2114.7400000000002s)]
*  And the moral question would be, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2115.82s)]
*  if you knew you could stop Hitler from being president, would you do it? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2119.18s)]
*  And how would you do it? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2123.5s)]
*  And then they act that way. That's bullshit. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2124.86s)]
*  But what they don't recognize is that is deeply un-American. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2126.7799999999997s)]
*  And the only way you're going to beat this person [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2132.1s)]
*  or any person who runs for president is to be better than them. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2135.54s)]
*  That's what this country is supposed to be about. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2139.4199999999996s)]
*  Supposed to be about a meritocracy. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2141.66s)]
*  Supposed to be who is the best leader. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2143.54s)]
*  Is it her? Is it him? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2145.5s)]
*  Who is it? Who's the best leader? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2148.22s)]
*  And that's the person we should gravitate towards. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2149.9799999999996s)]
*  Who has the the ideas that make the most sense? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2151.8199999999997s)]
*  Who's the one who understands what the fuck is going on internationally [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2154.06s)]
*  on a deep sense, really can tell you like what the the people, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2158.26s)]
*  the puppeteers behind the strings, like how this is all happening? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2162.38s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of that would be taken away if we cap the money. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2165.3s)]
*  Well, you can raise, let's call it 10 million dollars. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2169.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes, you can each raise 10 million dollars. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2171.34s)]
*  Now, let's see who spends it the wisest. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2173.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, it's it seems insane that you could just donate [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2176.34s)]
*  fucking untold millions of dollars, these super PACs, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2180.9s)]
*  and they can support these presidents. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2184.9s)]
*  They're essentially running the country because you can't beat them. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2186.66s)]
*  And they play dirty. They play so dirty. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2189.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of impressive. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2192.34s)]
*  But it's also you're they're exposing the wiring under the machine [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2194.2200000000003s)]
*  in a way that it's never been exposed before. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2198.5s)]
*  You know, we never were totally aware of how wild it is that, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2201.78s)]
*  you know, there's a group of people that no one ever thinks about [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2207.26s)]
*  called the deep state that is real. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2210.02s)]
*  They're going to run Biden right out of there. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2213.5s)]
*  Make no mistake. Oh, they're running him out right now. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2215.1s)]
*  They're fucking running him out. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2217.02s)]
*  That's why all these crimes or all these these things he's being charged for. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2218.02s)]
*  And then that judge's decision. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2221.46s)]
*  How about that judge's decision that he was too mentally compromised to [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2222.78s)]
*  to be tried? That was the prosecutor's decision. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2229.78s)]
*  Or was it? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2233.46s)]
*  Investigators, her whatever his name was, H.U.R. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2234.22s)]
*  So who was in his report? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2237.14s)]
*  Yeah, let's see what the exact quote was. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2239.14s)]
*  Does anybody out there need that fucking report to just watch this guy [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2241.66s)]
*  and go like, hey, I feel bad for him. He's fucking old. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2245.14s)]
*  Right. We're all going to get there someday. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2247.98s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, can you not fucking look at this guy and go like some? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2250.02s)]
*  I can look in his fucking eyes and go like something's not fucking there. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2253.86s)]
*  Something's wrong. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2257.62s)]
*  It's the people that work under him, because if they if he goes, they go. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2258.86s)]
*  Then everybody gets appointed by the new person. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2263.46s)]
*  The report describes council. Yeah. OK. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2266.38s)]
*  Special the report described the 81 year old Democrats memory as. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2269.6200000000003s)]
*  I wonder why they write that the 81 year old Democrat. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2274.0600000000004s)]
*  How about the president? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2276.5400000000004s)]
*  How about the president's memory as hazy, fuzzy, faulty, poor [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2278.1000000000004s)]
*  and having significant limitations? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2282.5s)]
*  It noted that Biden could not recall defining milestones in his own life, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2284.82s)]
*  such as when his son, Bo, died or when he served as vice president. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2289.0200000000004s)]
*  God bless his son. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2293.1000000000004s)]
*  But think about just that the way they wrote that [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2294.98s)]
*  the 81 year old Democrats memory, why would they write that? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2298.7400000000002s)]
*  That seems so nuts. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  Like he's the president. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2304.78s)]
*  He's not just a random Democrat. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2307.5s)]
*  Like what defines him? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2309.3s)]
*  If you've got one word, you go with Democrats. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2310.42s)]
*  Is that the is that the Washington AP writing that [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2313.1000000000004s)]
*  or is that in the special prosecutors report? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2315.54s)]
*  I was unclear. I was unclear as well. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2317.82s)]
*  Because that's different. Right. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2320.86s)]
*  Of course, the AP is going to say that. Of course. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2322.1s)]
*  But I don't think they can see the special prosecutor saying that. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2323.9s)]
*  But it's not because then it sounds very political. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2326.9s)]
*  Yeah. But it's it's such a crazy thing to say to call him a Democrat. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2329.22s)]
*  He's the president. He's our leader. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2332.46s)]
*  I would put past the media. It's wild. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2335.14s)]
*  But this is what what I'm saying about like the wiring under the board [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2337.3399999999997s)]
*  has been exposed in a way that has never been exposed before. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2341.02s)]
*  What are you looking at? And you go, what? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2343.54s)]
*  What are you guys doing? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2345.94s)]
*  He can't he can't stand trial because he's mentally unfit, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2347.3399999999997s)]
*  but he can run the country. Don't worry about it. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2350.98s)]
*  He can't speak. And he's going to run again. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  Harley fucking walk. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2354.54s)]
*  But it seems like when they release information like that, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2355.82s)]
*  they know what they're doing. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2357.94s)]
*  They're slowly chipping away at it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2359.02s)]
*  And by the time probably, I would say, like May rolls around, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2361.02s)]
*  it'll probably be Gavin Newsom. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2365.78s)]
*  That would be my guess. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2367.7s)]
*  If I was I'm not like playing this sport. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2368.7400000000002s)]
*  So I'm watching it from the sideline. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2371.46s)]
*  I'm like, what would I do? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2373.3s)]
*  How would I what moves would I do? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2374.94s)]
*  I can't. How the fuck can they run? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2376.58s)]
*  I keep hearing that Gavin Newsom, Michelle Obama, like Gavin News. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2378.7s)]
*  How the fuck? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2381.74s)]
*  When you just look at California, one of the most beautiful states, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2383.18s)]
*  arguably the most beautiful in America, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2386.7s)]
*  resources for days, fucking everything. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2390.3799999999997s)]
*  And it's just him fucking Pelosi, fucking Maxine Waters, fucking Adam Shipp. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2392.62s)]
*  They just fuck the whole state up like fucked it up. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2397.8999999999996s)]
*  Everybody's running for the fucking hills. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2401.7s)]
*  You got to wonder how much of it is by design. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2404.7s)]
*  You got to wonder of it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2408.06s)]
*  How much is designed to make the population more unstable, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2408.94s)]
*  more violent, more scared, more crime, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2414.5s)]
*  less less ability to prosper. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2419.02s)]
*  Everybody goes like everyone's much more vulnerable. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2421.5s)]
*  Well, this seems like a lot of work of the Democrats, though. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2425.7000000000003s)]
*  It seems like something is probably behind it that's bigger than that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2429.1000000000004s)]
*  And if I would guess you're not conspiracy theorist, right? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2434.82s)]
*  I'm 100 percent a conspiracy theorist. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2437.6200000000003s)]
*  Right. I love a good conspiracy. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2439.42s)]
*  I believed in Bigfoot until about eight years ago. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2442.1800000000003s)]
*  Fucking the Yetis, another story. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2444.98s)]
*  I didn't say I didn't believe in the Yeti. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2447.38s)]
*  I don't anymore. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2449.54s)]
*  But I was all in for a while. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2451.26s)]
*  But I've been down so many rabbit holes, so many 9-11 rabbit holes, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2452.82s)]
*  so many, you know, Bohemian Grove rabbit holes. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2457.6200000000003s)]
*  I went there once. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2461.5s)]
*  I got kicked out. Did you? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2463.1800000000003s)]
*  You went to the Grove? Yeah. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2464.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh, shit. Why did you get kicked out? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2466.2599999999998s)]
*  Fucking weird. Fucking weird. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2467.7799999999997s)]
*  I punched a kid in the head. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2469.7s)]
*  You punched a kid in the head in Bohemian Grove? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2471.1s)]
*  Yeah, it turns out it turns out this fucking kid was an infiltrator. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2474.02s)]
*  So then after that, I was kind of this hero like a year or two later. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2479.7s)]
*  He come back. I was like, I'm not coming to your little fucking weird party [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2482.8999999999996s)]

*  one of those things. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2524.2599999999998s)]
*  And then I couldn't go to the to the concert that night. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2525.1s)]
*  I think Zach Brown or somebody's playing like you can't come. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2528.66s)]

*  And people would do legit, like legitimate journalists like John Ronson [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2578.1400000000003s)]
*  would do these things with them. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2581.5s)]

*  He wrote that book. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2591.98s)]
*  So you're getting publicly shamed about like social media shaming. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2593.42s)]
*  You know, like he's an interesting guy. He's very funny guy. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2597.82s)]
*  But he so he went with Alex to Bohemian Grove and they filmed these rituals. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2600.42s)]

*  But maybe they toned it down. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2693.02s)]

*  Oh, really? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2697.5800000000004s)]

*  OK, because when Alex snuck in was like. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2700.5s)]
*  This is like the 90s, Jamie, what was it? [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2705.5s)]
*  Like when Alex Jones and John Ronson snuck in to Bohemian Grove, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2709.02s)]
*  that's when they first got that video. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2711.94s)]
*  I want to say it was in the 90s. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2713.86s)]

*  It's fucking weird. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2720.38s)]
*  I met like Paul Pelosi and his son. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2721.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2724.02s)]
*  And like Chris Matthews, like, you know, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2725.14s)]
*  but I was hanging out with them. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2728.2599999999998s)]
*  We were having cool conversations. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2729.22s)]
*  Kind of weird. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2730.98s)]
*  And then they asked me like I had to come play my guitar. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2731.62s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2734.2599999999998s)]
*  I like sing at one of these camp things. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2735.22s)]
*  I was like, I feel so used. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2737.7799999999997s)]
*  I feel so dirty. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2740.9s)]
*  Like, I don't do this shit, man. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2742.02s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2744.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's got to be weird. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2747.06s)]
*  Hey, man, play us a song. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2748.14s)]
*  Well, it's kind of like a unspoken requirement, like a wink wink. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2750.46s)]
*  You need to take a guitar over there, you know, if you want to [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2754.5s)]
*  be in good graces or be a team player type deal. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2757.86s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I really don't. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2760.5s)]
*  A friend of mine went to a party and in the middle of the party, Michael Bolton [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2762.9s)]
*  just starts singing and everybody gathers around while Michael Bolton was standing there singing. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2768.1s)]
*  Was it set up? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2773.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was set up. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2774.74s)]
*  Oh, that's fine. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2775.62s)]
*  But no one knew. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2776.3399999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden, like, I think no one knew. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2777.54s)]
*  How do you know? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2779.46s)]
*  But it was just like, what's going on? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2781.06s)]
*  Then how do you know? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2782.66s)]
*  All of a sudden, Michael Bolton singing and everyone just be quiet. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2783.46s)]
*  It's not a bad strategy if you want to don't want to look like a putz to like. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2786.5s)]
*  Otherwise, just like, hey, these motherfuckers pay me a shit ton of money [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2790.5s)]
*  and I'm going to sing some songs. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2793.14s)]
*  Right. That's what it is. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2794.26s)]
*  It's like the ultimate flex, you know? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2795.46s)]
*  Yeah, that's how I used to fund my foundation to a corporate gig. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2798.34s)]
*  Dude, Dana White had a birthday party. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2801.94s)]
*  I've played it a few times. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2804.1s)]
*  I know you have. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2805.14s)]
*  I know you have. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2805.86s)]
*  And Dana White's birthday parties are wild. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2806.9s)]
*  And he had a birthday party. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2808.9s)]
*  I think it was for his 40th and Stone Temple Pilots played. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2810.34s)]
*  Dude, they put on a show like it was a fucking packed arena. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2813.94s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2818.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I know that's Dana. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2819.3s)]
*  That's exactly what he said to me. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2820.66s)]
*  He goes, there's 150 people. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2822.1s)]
*  You're good. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2823.38s)]
*  Where do you think you were? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2823.7s)]
*  I was like fucking AT&T Stadium. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2824.5s)]
*  That's exactly what he told me. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2827.46s)]
*  You kind of got to put yourself in that mindset. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2828.66s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2830.98s)]
*  Because those things can be fucking grueling. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2831.78s)]
*  Right. They can be weird if people aren't paying attention. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2834.18s)]
*  And the Stone Temple Pilots thing, there wasn't a lot of people there. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2838.18s)]
*  There was only a few hundred people there. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2840.66s)]
*  That's usually what they are. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2842.7400000000002s)]
*  A couple hundred people. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2843.6200000000003s)]
*  Dude was killing it. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2844.9s)]
*  Killing it. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2846.58s)]

*  And you felt like super lucky to be there. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2863.38s)]
*  That's great. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2865.86s)]
*  There's something about seeing something where there's not a lot of people around to see it. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2867.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why I like watching those UFC fights in the Apex Center. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2872.34s)]
*  There's something about even though I know the world seeing it on video, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2875.46s)]
*  like to be there live while that's happening. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2878.42s)]
*  That was one of the positive things about Kroger. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2882.1800000000003s)]
*  Can we talk about that punch at the last fucking one we were at sitting there? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2884.02s)]
*  That fucking I think it was the second. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2888.82s)]

*  I know you fucking obviously that's your. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2896.42s)]
*  Josh Emmett might be the hardest puncher in that division. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2898.98s)]
*  I never heard anything like that. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2901.38s)]
*  He hit so hard. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2903.06s)]
*  I thought the guy was dead. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2904.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2905.3s)]
*  Well, that was a crazy combination of Bryce Mitchell moving forward quick [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2905.78s)]
*  and then him catching him right at the end of one of the most powerful punchers ever [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2910.1800000000003s)]
*  in the 145 pound division. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2915.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2917.38s)]

*  But you can't appreciate it without the smack. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2921.06s)]
*  Smack. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2923.1400000000003s)]
*  Look at the fucking physique on this animal. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2924.02s)]
*  I mean, Josh Emmett is just a ball of muscle. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2926.58s)]
*  Bro, that guy. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2932.1800000000003s)]
*  Sounded like somebody smacked a two by four like against a garbage can. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2933.1400000000003s)]
*  Bro, if that guy hits anybody, they go night night. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2937.54s)]
*  I mean, anybody. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2940.82s)]
*  Damn. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2942.02s)]
*  Anybody. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2942.82s)]
*  He had this fight with Michael Johnson and it was a real Michael Johnson's a really good fighter. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2944.1800000000003s)]
*  Like he knocked out Dustin Poirier at one point. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2948.7400000000002s)]
*  Michael Johnson's very, very legit. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2951.62s)]
*  And Michael Johnson's winning the fight and Josh Emmett catches him with one punch [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2954.26s)]
*  and just shuts him off. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2960.02s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2961.86s)]
*  So Michael Johnson's winning this fight. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2963.7s)]
*  Boom. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2966.1s)]
*  Boom. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2966.6s)]
*  One shot, dude. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2967.78s)]
*  One shot. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2969.06s)]
*  I mean, crazy power, man. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2969.94s)]
*  I mean, his power is preposterous. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2972.74s)]
*  He's got the total touch what Farras Sahabi calls the touch of death. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2975.7s)]
*  That's the touch of death. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2980.02s)]
*  He's got it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2981.7s)]
*  He's got it better than anybody in the sport. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2982.2599999999998s)]
*  The touch of death. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2984.82s)]
*  But that Ilja Toporia guy that just knocked out Volkanovski. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2985.94s)]
*  He's got the touch of death, too. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2989.46s)]
*  There's guys getting bigger. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2991.7s)]
*  They're just getting stronger, but their technique's getting better. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2993.7s)]
*  It's like any sport. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2996.18s)]
*  It just keeps. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2997.06s)]
*  There's a lot of factors. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=2999.06s)]
*  There's a lot of factors to having that kind of power. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3000.34s)]
*  And some of it is just pure genetics. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3002.7400000000002s)]
*  Some of it is just you just got lucky. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3004.7400000000002s)]
*  You got that frame, whatever it is. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3006.26s)]
*  Like Josh, he's built like if you look at his body, it's just like a fucking tank. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3008.26s)]
*  Just his ball of muscle. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3012.58s)]
*  And he gets so much force into it. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3014.18s)]
*  And that's just a gigantic advantage. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3016.5s)]
*  If you use it correctly, like Toporia does. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3019.62s)]
*  Did you see that fight with Toporia and Volkanovski? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3022.26s)]
*  I still don't know all the names. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3024.66s)]
*  I know a handful of names. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3025.86s)]
*  It was the featherweight title this past weekend. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3026.7400000000002s)]
*  No. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3029.14s)]
*  Alexander Volkanovski was trying to defend his title against Ilja Toporia. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3029.78s)]
*  And Volkanovski had been dominant in this division forever. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3035.62s)]
*  And Toporia put him to sleep, man. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3038.82s)]
*  This is not the fight, by the way. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3041.2200000000003s)]
*  This is just like. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3042.42s)]
*  Yeah, the lead up to the fight. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3043.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Toporia, he put him to sleep. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3046.18s)]
*  It was wild to see, man. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3048.58s)]
*  This kid is a fucking monster. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3049.94s)]
*  And he's only 27 years old. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3052.26s)]
*  And he said he was going to do it. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3054.5s)]
*  He said, I'm going to knock him out in the second round. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3055.46s)]
*  Well, do any of those guys go and go like, you know, my chances are about 50-50 on this one. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3058.74s)]
*  No, some guys have respect, you know, for their opponents. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3064.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3068.34s)]
*  They say things like, he's a great champion. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3068.74s)]
*  That's no fun, though. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3072.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3073.06s)]
*  That's no fun. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3073.46s)]
*  This is a talk shit sport. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3074.5s)]
*  It is. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3076.26s)]
*  And it hypes up the match, gets everybody going. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3076.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3079.46s)]
*  Fucking. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3079.78s)]
*  And it's also part of the psychological warfare because that shit works. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3080.42s)]
*  Especially on some people. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3084.58s)]
*  Some people like Nate Diaz doesn't work on it at all. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3085.78s)]
*  You can talk shit to him all day long. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3088.66s)]
*  That does not going to change anything about the kind of ass whooping you're going to get. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3090.66s)]
*  But for some guys, it fucks with their head hardcore. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3094.66s)]
*  They just have a really hard time with someone talking shit about them. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3097.62s)]
*  And they get real emotional. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3100.18s)]
*  It's a lot of sports, a lot of fucking even in my business in music. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3101.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3104.42s)]
*  See people when that red light comes on, when you're doing something like live or taped to [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3104.9s)]
*  television or whatever, you see people that red light comes on. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3109.62s)]
*  I have band members. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3111.94s)]
*  I like 10 of them. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3113.62s)]
*  It's usually one. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3114.5s)]
*  Somebody just fucking can't keep it together and fucks up. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3116.1s)]
*  It's just one of those things. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3120.1s)]
*  It's just something about having that fucking cool, calm, collective fucking mindset. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3121.3s)]
*  When you're going into anything that's stressful or, you know, high energy, whatever it might be. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3127.14s)]
*  How much? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3132.58s)]
*  How difficult was it for you when you first started getting famous? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3133.7799999999997s)]
*  Because you go from being a regular dude to being Kid Rock in not a lot of time. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3138.1s)]
*  What was it like getting pussy? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3144.58s)]
*  No, it wasn't like being the man. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3146.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's pretty much what it was. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3148.58s)]
*  But was it stressful? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3151.3799999999997s)]
*  Was it like hard to deal with? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3152.66s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3154.58s)]
*  Wasn't it all fucking awesome? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3155.46s)]
*  I love it. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3158.42s)]

*  We're getting a new car. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3168.5s)]
*  If I can get a nice seat at the restaurant. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3170.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3173.06s)]
*  Fucking no problem with that. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3173.14s)]
*  I'm not one of those people that bitch about it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3175.7s)]
*  What do you think it is about? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3177.7799999999997s)]
*  What do you think about people that can't handle it? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3179.22s)]
*  Like what do you think it is? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3181.14s)]
*  Fucking get away from it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=3182.2599999999998s)]

*  I was gonna get like 10,000 acres in the middle of nowhere build my fucking little [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4098.04s)]
*  fucking redneck empire and then so I started taking these lessons in a single engine Robinson and I [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4101.32s)]
*  let my hand off the collective a couple times like you know the the fucking the teacher's like dude [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4107.88s)]

*  and then what really was a deal breaker I'm like I know myself I'm like we'll be sitting around [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4117.16s)]
*  getting tuned up and I'll be like you guys want to get the chopper out [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4123.88s)]
*  go for a spin oh my god flying oh yeah I was like could you imagine no let's let's make enough [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4128.84s)]
*  money to ride in the back yeah the only times that I've been in one I'm like keep it together [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4136.04s)]
*  it feels like you're in a flying football helmet it seems so fragile they seem so fragile when [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4142.2s)]
*  you're in them they're like I'll never get in a single engine and anything again that flies [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4150.599999999999s)]
*  never everything's everything that flies is based on a system of two two fuel pumps two engines [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4155.96s)]
*  two everything you can go with without one of them so your odds are pretty good when those things [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4162.36s)]
*  fuck up mainly speaking about planes it's pilot error probably 90 some percent of time there was [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4167.88s)]
*  a recent private jet that crashed yeah in LA yeah what was the challenger yeah challenger [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4173.32s)]
*  300 a couple people got out of the back and the pilots died yeah yeah the people survived which [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4180.28s)]
*  is crazy if you look at the foot of the passengers did oh Jesus Christ dude that's insane I thought [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4184.76s)]
*  that was oh my god it is in Florida okay right dude that is so wild to see watch this land watch [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4191.24s)]
*  this happen again yeah do it from the beginning because the beginning watch this watch this land [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4200.28s)]
*  this is so crazy that's what kind of look at this that's the kind of plane I got look at that bro [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4206.28s)]
*  fuck I mean how insane is that and I think it was three people came out of the back yeah the pilots [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4211.32s)]
*  amazing amazing oh damn they just had to just land it on the fucking highway holy shit man [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4218.28s)]
*  imagine trying to land a plane and knowing you're going to take out those cars and you're probably [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4228.04s)]
*  not going to land anyway you're probably not going to be able to pull it off anyway you don't have [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4233.16s)]
*  any engines anymore scary oh my god it's scary just not being in control of anything yeah at [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4235.96s)]
*  least for me I'm a bit of a control freak like just not being in control of any situation [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4242.92s)]
*  especially when it's something like that that always yeah that's makes you think a little bit [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4248.04s)]
*  more that's why when when things aren't a meritocracy and you're you're hiring because [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4252.84s)]
*  you want things to be inclusive you're not getting the best people working on your fucking airplanes [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4258.92s)]
*  flying your airplanes you're not getting the best people what are you doing like that is one of the [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4265.88s)]
*  but for especially like airlines that is one of the scariest fucking methods of transportation [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4272.679999999999s)]
*  whether it's the safest that's arguable it is very safe relatively but it's one of the scariest [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4278.2s)]
*  for people it gives them the most anxiety because you give up all control you're hoping that the [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4283.639999999999s)]
*  pilots can keep it together you're hoping that the equipment's been tested correctly you're hoping [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4287.5599999999995s)]
*  that everybody like tightens every bolt and checks every fucking well they you're hoping they do a [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4291.88s)]
*  really good job like they're really good at it they do do a pretty good job overall like and [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4296.92s)]
*  i'll even say you know like you know just a lot like this is a place that makes sense for regulations [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4303.0s)]
*  yeah you know what i mean that as somebody who's very you know very right of center [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4309.08s)]
*  you know you know less regular regulations on most things that's something that makes sense and they [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4315.64s)]
*  have a lot of good ones in place you know it's they you just can't fucking jump in a plane like [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4321.4800000000005s)]
*  when something like that happens it's something fucked up yeah it'd be interesting to see when [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4326.6s)]
*  they you know do their investigation what happened exactly yeah it would be interesting like how does [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4330.68s)]
*  it how do you get a double engine failure that sounds insane or maybe it's like when sully you [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4334.76s)]
*  know landed that on the hudson river it was you know geese or whatever right or something like [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4339.0s)]
*  that okay that's you know you know i've flown out of many airports where they go out there with [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4342.6s)]
*  shotguns before just to boom get with blanks just to get the you know geese out of there [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4347.56s)]
*  and they actually let you hunt them at some certain times of years like i know a metro [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4353.08s)]
*  airport detroit there was a congressman that asked they had a special permit to go over there [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4356.2s)]
*  and hunt them at certain times of the year and i love the bird hunt yeah they try to keep populations [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4360.12s)]
*  down they have snipers they do a lot of different things to keep they try a bunch of different [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4365.24s)]
*  methods to keep ducks and pigeons and shit because how many planes have been taken out by birds [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4369.08s)]
*  probably quite a few huh it's becoming more common really you never know if something's more common [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4374.92s)]
*  or is the media just that much more accessible right with everything i always wonder with that [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4380.76s)]
*  like as the population grows things make sense that gets more of whatever right but you just [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4385.64s)]
*  don't know in this day and age like it's you know when there's fucking how many 24 seven news [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4392.4400000000005s)]

*  that's what we need then there should be value in just the news and that's what dr phil wants [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4431.24s)]
*  to do they're supposed to be that's supposed to be the ap yeah it's supposed to be but it's not [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4435.96s)]
*  anymore because i think journalists at some point in time the at least corporate journalists a big [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4440.68s)]
*  percentage of them decided that they're working towards a better future they're like they're [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4448.44s)]
*  activists you know and i think some of those people are not very charismatic and they're [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4453.08s)]
*  they're people don't like them that much they just happen to be on television why do many of these [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4459.88s)]
*  people refuse to retire because now they have a career they have that's all they have their identity [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4463.96s)]
*  it's our identity like the 75 years old plus you refuse to go away yeah they won't go away [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4470.04s)]
*  and they also want to give their opinions all the time a lot of these people want to give their [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4476.84s)]
*  opinions on things yeah i want someone who's actually as if they're in the media who has [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4480.28s)]
*  consequences on their opinions when you're fucking 77 you know and you're what's your name from abc [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4485.16s)]

*  reports fucking world news yeah you're like she has nothing to fucking lose that's not a journalist [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4495.32s)]
*  i want somebody who's young has a family like you have shit to actually lose if you're going to sway [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4501.639999999999s)]
*  things to set in the other and get called out on it if you're in the media if you want to talk shit [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4506.2s)]
*  join a band i just feel like we need objective news with no spin at all absolutely and not [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4510.28s)]
*  coming out of a place where you don't want to report on a certain thing because it makes trump [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4518.52s)]
*  look good not not you know just look at what are what are the facts what are we dealing with like [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4522.68s)]
*  what are we dealing with in terms of the economy what are we dealing with in terms of international [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4528.120000000001s)]
*  conflict what are the facts what's actually happening don't don't twist it in some weird [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4531.88s)]
*  if they went by conservative way if they went by facts and things like that there's no one been [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4537.4800000000005s)]
*  better than trump the shit he got done and if you just look at the numbers in his record [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4543.96s)]
*  forget about all the noise you see that guy was one of the founders of facebook who talked about [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4549.0s)]
*  it and he said it was the right message but the wrong messenger he talked about all the different [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4553.88s)]
*  things that trump did that it turns out it worked but i but i even though we're friends i i even [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4558.12s)]
*  before we became good friends like i understood as i think a lot of people did not not a ton [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4566.12s)]
*  a good amount of people understood that there's a method to that to what people call madness when [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4572.28s)]
*  he says you know like fucking russia go after fucking poland if you don't want to pay your fair [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4577.08s)]

*  in there and fucking let them know you're gonna pay your fucking money he's not gonna let that [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4590.36s)]
*  happen i i would say in my heart and the way i feel there's no fucking way to let that happen [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4595.08s)]
*  it's like when he's telling certain countries you know like if you're gonna go into ukraine i'll [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4600.2s)]
*  fucking blow up moscow even if they only believe in five percent fucking keeps him out you know [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4603.96s)]
*  what i mean the guy knows how to fucking go in and get shit done and talk business-wise and make [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4610.44s)]
*  these statements and this then and they don't know what the fuck he's gonna do but i have to say when [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4616.2s)]
*  he was in office by me he did the right thing pretty much every fucking time everything he did [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4621.24s)]
*  for this country whether it was keeping the border in check fucking everybody working including [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4627.4s)]

*  to it they'd be able to see that but that's one of the most amazing things the media has done [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4642.28s)]
*  is they've turned a guy who is a celebrity who was beloved he was the host of the celebrity apprentice [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4646.36s)]

*  whole thing when the left is calling for war and the left wants war that's like what has happened [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4665.24s)]
*  to the world trump just said the smartest thing everything he says to me is fucking great but [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4671.48s)]
*  smartest things like we should not i've kind of spoke about this with family and friends [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4678.6s)]
*  through the years like why do we keep getting these wars giving countries this fucking money [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4682.200000000001s)]

*  take land or natural resources that they can buy back one day with a small interest or something [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4693.64s)]
*  why are we just giving fucking money away giving our resources oh you know the fucking trillions [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0puYyp47MY&t=4699.240000000001s)]
