# Joe Rogan Experience #1493 - Steve Schirripa & Michael Imperioli
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdLTWICADhM)
*  One... Steve! Yes sir! Good to see you buddy. Good to see you brother Michael. Pleasure to meet you man.
*  Thanks for having us today. Yeah really thanks. It's been a while I saw you...
*  The last time I saw you was at the old studio. Three years ago. It looks exactly... it's eerie.
*  Yeah I'm gonna do it again the next place I move. I'm gonna re-build this whole thing again.
*  That's my move. Just make it look like this. Make it comfortable you know you like what you like.
*  It looks like the same thing. Yeah that way you don't get confused. Same desk. Yeah this is great.
*  Good to see you. Good to see you too brother. I'm bummed out though about your sauce. Yeah yeah.
*  I was just bragging to somebody about it the other day. We grew too fast but you have two of the last ones left.
*  I don't know what to do. That inexistent. Do I like let it sit on the shelf? No no no. Listen the sauce was good.
*  It's all natural and organic. It was all good. Just unfortunately it grew too fast and my partner
*  you know we had enough. He lost a lot of money but not for lack of trying. Order product.
*  No the product's excellent. Let me tell you the biggest fucking thieves. Okay. Bigger than the mob.
*  Bigger than any thief. These stores that you do business with okay and the distributors and then
*  you have all these people with their hand in the pie. So we buy the sauce. It's our recipe.
*  That guy makes it. Now we got to give it to a distributor. You can't go direct to like Whole Foods and shit.
*  So there's other hands in the pie. Now you give them a bill for 20 grand of sauce that you gave them
*  and they send you back a check for three grand and they go well there was breakage and there was this
*  and there was that and you have to pay more money in the store to have it in the front and have it
*  stacked. Oh really? You are fucked. You are fucked. Just like a book you know I've had books I don't
*  know if you have I have books out. Barnes and Noble. To say Barnes and Noble you had a book out
*  right you have a book out. Barnes and Noble favorite. You got to pay more for that. To have the book on
*  the shelf turned this way you got to pay more for that. They nickel and dime you and they fuck
*  and kill you. They are the real mob. I'm telling you. Are they worse than funeral homes though?
*  No one's worse than funeral homes. Well they tug on your heartstrings. Yeah come on you they
*  was a great guy aren't you gonna have the nice box. Did you start out doing this just through the
*  internet though? You know we started in the stores. We didn't really you know we came to Amazon later.
*  My partner. The trade shows. Joe Scarpe. Joe Scarpe being a great guy he was here last time.
*  My partner he put up the money he's a builder. He said we're gonna make 50 million.
*  We're gonna sell the company and he's got 50 million. He doesn't need another 50. And got a
*  little greedy. No he wanted to go listen he's not a small-time guy it's all or nothing. So I give
*  him credit for that. It's such a good sauce though it kind of seems like you should just do it online.
*  Maybe they'll make a comeback you know and like I said if we would have stayed small delis you know
*  it was doing great Staten Island you know the biggest Italian area you know the Guinea gang
*  plank there all them Italians ate jarred sauce even they won't admit it they fucking like that
*  sauce right. It's a good sauce. It's natural it doesn't have that acidity thing that a lot of
*  jarred sauces have. You know and you know I did all the prayers we did all the shit. I said if I
*  would have instead of being a partner I should have made $20 an hour I would as well.
*  So you guys are doing a podcast now? We're doing a podcast. Re-watch. Yeah. Yeah Sussman clued me
*  into it. Yeah it's cool. We got approached by a bunch of different producers towards the end of
*  last year about it wasn't our idea and we thought about it we had done a show like on stage in
*  conversation like inside the actor's studio and we did all over the country did Australia last year
*  and then a couple of producers said you know do you want to do a podcast and we worked Jeff was
*  the best of the producers so we figured out a way to do it we were going to do it in the studio live
*  like this at the end of March in New York and the COVID hit everything hit so we weren't going to do
*  it at all we were going to put it off because we were depressed and we were like who needs a podcast
*  in the midst of all this stuff. What is New York like right now? You know I've been there I left
*  I've been here a month now you know I have a place down in Orange County and New York was all
*  fucked up and it's all boarded up and my daughter's there I live downtown way downtown and I was going
*  out like an hour a day you know that's it I just went out an hour a day I would take a walk and
*  the streets are empty yeah streets are empty at night now after the looting they destroyed SoHo
*  yeah you know it's just destroyed you know and the cops are very timid and
*  and it's all fucked up I mean it's all fucked up I don't know what happens there I mean I
*  don't know I don't know how it happened like seeing the cops just standing around while they were
*  looting the art galleries in SoHo while they were smashing Fifth Avenue I don't know what the fuck
*  is this I don't know it's like the end of the world you know what's scary and de Blasio is the
*  worst fucking I'm not a political guy at all Joe like not at all but he's the worst fucking human
*  that maybe walks the face of the earth I kid you not and you know I owned an apartment in Manhattan
*  for like nine years and when he became the mayor within a year you saw even six months right you
*  saw like these fucking changes I'm going I'm out I'm selling my fucking place and I sold my place
*  what changes all kinds of shit the cops basically they have one hand tied behind their back he
*  changed all these laws stopping frisks some needed to be changed some not just the homeless is
*  everywhere all of a sudden the trains are impossible there's all kinds of shit going on you know and
*  I have to blame the mayor I mean there's you know where I live downtown there's
*  listen I'm compassionate to the homeless I don't know the answer which is why I'm not the fucking
*  mayor but they're everywhere same thing here you know yeah our governor was the mayor of San
*  Francisco which is the craziest fucking place you've ever seen in your life when it comes to
*  homeless people yeah it's a problem and now after COVID it's like ramped up 40% and the homeless
*  situation there is it doesn't even make sense like you're seeing these beautiful homes and
*  there's campsites in front of them and these people have to come out of their houses and you
*  know tiptoe around needles and broken bottles and and people's shit this might get worse though
*  right after COVID with the economy you know collapsing as it did yeah well that's what
*  that's what was happening with the COVID too in New York because listen these guys standing on
*  the corner they're panhandling there's no one there was no one to get money from I mean there
*  was no one to panhandle the streets were completely empty Broadway downtown you could
*  shoot a cannon through it not a car yeah Mark Norman you know in the comic Mark Norman hilarious
*  guy filmed a bunch of shit with him just running around New York City with empty streets nobody
*  around how weird it looked wall street is empty all these places that are packed were empty
*  I don't know the answer and with the cops I don't know I mean I just don't know I mean it's all so
*  bizarre and I think so many people are either going to resign from the force but definitely
*  not join the force there's a lot of guys that are thinking about joining that's a tough job man
*  for very little pay and you're putting your life at stake and just public opinion of the force is
*  down so low I don't get it listen I know uh if God forbid I had trouble I call a cop I'm pro cop
*  I play a cop now you know I've been on blue bloods for five years I play a detective
*  I'm pro cop you play cops you're just for playing a detective played a homicide detective yeah
*  we went from wise guys to detectives there's a fine line there's a fine line there
*  but yeah but I agree uh in New York is uh my daughter had just come back and
*  really depressing man you know you haven't been right no I've been in California since March 1st
*  I was in New York before that and uh so yeah I got couldn't go back really but I live here
*  and there both places yeah there was a little easier here up in uh Santa Barbara area I love
*  it up there yeah a lot easier to be quarantined there because you go outside and backyard and
*  stuff like that yeah the beach it's like Santa Barbara's the perfect size but I I mean I was
*  in New York they shut us down March 13th with two and a half episodes to go we just got shut down
*  and then they you know then you couldn't even go out of the house two days later I mean I wasn't
*  aware of anything I mean the trains were packed I was taking the train and and shit and I went to a
*  concert a few days before at the beacon you know Dave Matthews and Jackson Brown there was a
*  fucking concert but nobody said anything you know and uh Jackson Brown got sick yeah he got sick
*  maybe at that concert you know maybe but uh then it was just I was there for two months and it was
*  gloom and I'm in a building so you got to watch the elevator the fucking doorman the thing you know
*  order food in you know it's just crazy makes you crazy wipe off the package don't wipe off the
*  package wear gloves don't wear gloves what the fuck nobody knows it's a very very confusing time
*  yeah nobody knows what the fuck is going on so we were doing a podcast it was a good thing to do in
*  the midst of all this because we figured out a way to do it at home so we didn't have to you know be
*  in a studio um set up a little studio in the house you know figured out a way to do it um he was in
*  New York and I was in California and we that's how we started yeah it can be done you know it's and
*  there's so many people listening to shit now yeah the thing is consumer consumers are up in in terms
*  of like watchers viewers of shows listeners of podcasts it's all up because people were just
*  sitting around doing nothing for months at a time right it was kind of particularly good timing for
*  us because the sopranos was being binged watched in by people in quarantine like rediscovering it
*  young people who had never seen it it was I think it was HBO's number two series and that includes
*  all their new stuff like game of thrones and everything and soprano I think it was west world
*  and the sopranos were their biggest shows during quarantine the show's been off the air for 13
*  years well listen this is one of the best fucking shows of all time it really is you know you guys
*  were on without a doubt and when the history is written it is one of the best shows ever yeah no
*  no you know what's amazing neither one of us watched it in 20 years I mean I don't watch the
*  show I mean I watched it one time when it came out years ago and uh and we weren't even good we
*  were kind of depressed and we're going who the fuck cares about a tv show now because the world
*  was coming to an end especially at the beginning you know Joe I mean and we had gotten offered
*  shit and and Jeff helped us we were giving Jeff like contracts is this a good deal is this a good
*  deal finally he said listen I'll fucking help you we should tell him that Jeff's my manager yeah
*  so he helped us and uh we started doing the rewatch which is obviously bittersweet because
*  of Jim you know you're watching Jim and he's young and and I came on the second season you know the
*  second episode but the show holds up every fucking uh like it was shot yesterday besides the phones
*  and the computers everything else is like it was done yesterday it's not dated at all the show
*  and we weren't gonna you know we were gonna wait till things got back to normal so we could be in
*  a studio like this and be face to face but we got so much uh communication from fans like on social
*  media saying hey we heard you're doing a podcast where is it we're binge watching the show in
*  quarantine like tons of you know tons of that so we figured out a way to do it so you know we we
*  watched the episode we we're up to episode uh 12 now you know it's on youtube and wherever you get
*  to the podcast and then uh we run down the episode he wrote five of them so he knows every every he
*  knows a lot more than me I watch it more like a regular viewer we tell stories behind the scenes
*  shit stuff that went on stuff we remember we've had guests we got edie falco next week we've had
*  the casting people we've had uh the two kids robert isla director you know whoever made the
*  show a success so costume designer well it's a great thing to do to go back and review it just
*  to kind of give the people that are fans this this sense of you know what it was like for you guys and
*  what it's like to see it again and and just to put it into context in history when that's the show
*  that started off these kind of shows when you think about the shows that you have today like the osarx
*  and all these different like really kind of wild shows where you have to follow one episode to the
*  next and you have to know what just happened to pay attention to the new episode the soprano
*  started that shit yeah that was and it was also the first show where there was a real anti-hero
*  anti-hero yeah absolutely and it was also bringing a cinematic quality to television people would
*  traditionally go to the movies for or even a novelistic quality well in a sense better
*  because you could do it over the course of many hours you weren't limited by an hour and a half
*  two-hour time frame you could do it over the course of multiple hours right and he wasn't
*  you know listen he was a overweight balding guy he wasn't your typical leading man like he was
*  sexy chicks liked them they loved them i told you we used to say uh tv doesn't put fifth uh what
*  he used to say all the time uh you know they used to say tv puts 10 pounds or on you i say
*  it takes 50 pounds off you well there was something about his character i mean first of all
*  he was a phenomenal actor like always always was i mean he was fucking insane and everything he did
*  true romance i mean you just go back through his whole history of his career but that show
*  doing tony soprano just fucking synced whatever it was yeah his look those moments when the actor
*  and the role really come yes great role really come together because they don't always they don't
*  always he was fucking perfect for that role and you know you see him like their scenes and now i
*  look at it kind of differently obviously than back then you know back then i was just trying not to
*  get fucking killed you know now you're you're watching it and in in one scene right there's
*  some incredible scenes where he's happy mad furious in in one three minute scene he goes
*  through four different emotions it's he's amazing and you know i don't know if you remember this but
*  when i first got the job uh i had to go i i got the job i auditioned i got the job i had to go to
*  a read-through and i happened to see you i think you were working in vegas at the riv and i said
*  joe what i asked you in another comic i think bill kurkumbau i said what what what goes on in
*  a read through because even though i had worked i didn't know right right and i said do you do it
*  like 100 percent and you told me you know like you know 85 90 like don't go all in you actually told
*  me that for an audition or for the audition uh for the for the read through a read through i mean do
*  you know you're around the table i didn't quite know if you go all you know fucking start acting
*  you know or you just read the lines which some people do just flat which is terrible i mean
*  that's not the answer there's people that actually get fired during the read through right right
*  after a read through there's actually you know that right because they're so flat i didn't know i
*  didn't i honestly if i would have known that they should have known that already yeah but if i would
*  have known that you could get fired after the read through i would have been shit in my past i
*  was so naive that i didn't even realize that well that's the interesting thing when i tell people
*  that i knew you from the riv and they go what did he do there i go here's the talent coordinator
*  shut the fuck up i go yeah i worked for him i got booked by steve shiripa at the riviera was one of
*  the first times i ever worked in vegas it was great and you had gotten some gigs through drew
*  carry you had done the drew carry i said drew carry show bruce baum helped me kevin pollock
*  those guys at the beginning absolutely i did drew special was the first acting you did
*  actually first acting i did was bruce baum on the golf course we did a thing then lennie clark
*  uh i played a prison guard what in a special yeah he had like these uh remember friday night comics
*  uh-huh remember that show on fox yeah they were like little sketches five minute sketches and
*  we we had lennie clark in the uh we had he was in the chair lecture chair is he from england
*  let me know he's from boston oh no and he and i pulled the switch i swear to you i look right
*  into the camera right into the fucking i didn't know what i was doing that was the second thing
*  i did then kevin pollock put me in his special i played his bodyguard and then drew and you know
*  little shit little shit you know did you start as an actor or comedian comedian a comedian yeah i
*  only acted for a little while i just did news radio do you like it i like stand up better yeah
*  the acting problem is actors you have to hang out with actors that's the problem with acting
*  yeah but you were so sensitive and just it's just they're you know some of them are great the news
*  radio people were great it wasn't a problem the problem was when i'd run into other actors you
*  meet them there's just this this boundary of bullshit yeah of course you have to get to the
*  actual person absolutely whereas comics are right there they're right there for you you meet a comic
*  on the road like your comic i don't know i meet him like hey what the fuck you doing i'm working
*  for this guy and that guy huh he's right there they're right there you meet him instantly see i
*  find it the opposite really how so the actors i find like what you're saying about comics i find
*  about actors and i find the opposite about comedians you know what maybe that is it's that
*  because that's where you're coming from right they know oh it's michael i'm not saying that
*  just to be contrary no no no i believe you mean it yeah but also there's a difference between new
*  york actors and la actors that is true that's a big difference between these tv actors and
*  there's there's something about that they can almost fucking taste it it's like the actors that
*  aren't quite there yet that you can they can almost taste it they're kind of working but they're not
*  secure yeah they're kind of getting auditions and maybe they might book something but maybe they
*  won't do you remember when we auditioned for uh we auditioned look at you oh yeah look that's my
*  first thing i ever did cheer man we shot it out here look that's the tuxedo from the riff
*  is it really oh that's hilarious did you show this to david chase to get the sopranos is that
*  you can see i'm not a golfer obviously when you got the sopranos i was like holy shit and it was
*  for me it was a thing that i would tell people it was like listen there's certain things that
*  a person could just do you can't just go on stage and do stand-up it takes too long you can't just
*  learn guitar but some people can fucking act and you were really good not in theater though in
*  film and television is different in theater oh god yeah you can't just you can get somebody
*  who's never acted and if you're a good director or something get them in front of a camera make them
*  feel comfortable give them stuff to do but you can't put them on a stage it's because the crowd
*  because the crowd you know like you said with stand-up yeah crowd you're on stage you have to
*  fit you know you there's no second take you have to you have to create these moments for two hours
*  straight and sustain it's not just getting a couple of lines right but you know there's actors
*  like you can't just learn stand-up it's a very underrated art form okay absolutely to me you have
*  to do it and do it you're by yourself you're out there there's actors like what's his fucking
*  name pivin that little fuck jeremy pivin he's a stand-up comic now now how'd that happen
*  is he a stand-up comic or is he acting as a stand-up did you see a stand-up i have not seen it he what
*  he's basically doing is what he can do i mean i don't i think because of all that shit that
*  happened with him yeah two movies survival it's nothing else he can do but but do you know what
*  i'm saying i mean i've seen comics listen i was around comics from 1986 i started at the riviera
*  all right it's it's very difficult it takes guys years and years and years and years to find their
*  voice their rhythm even if a comic if you don't like their material not every comics for every guy
*  you know the guy's a pro he's really good it's subjective yes hey don't make me laugh at this
*  guy i think it's hilarious but you know when a guy just don't have it i mean these guys you know
*  and there's a lot there's numerous actors that all humorous whatever they are that started doing
*  stand-up without putting all the work in yeah i think what happens is the income opportunities
*  get smaller yeah sure and then they look at stand-up and then someone says listen we can
*  schedule a tour for you you know you do this size i don't blame them for doing it yeah i'm just
*  saying i mean it's a different thing i don't blame them but it's a different thing hey listen
*  the fire he's good though pivin is he i just read reviews i have no idea i just find it hard to
*  believe very surprised actually that he was good at it i still don't like because they expected him
*  they expected him not to be good he's a fucking rude fuck uh but me and you audition i think you
*  got the role we didn't audition for the same role but it was a bob simon's movie what movie is that
*  i didn't get it definitely because i didn't do it the only movies i've ever done is kevin james
*  movies really yeah yeah because we auditioned and peewee herman came out he was yes we auditioned
*  dave sharridan what year is this we're going way back i was on the sopranos already but probably
*  early 2000s we were there dave sharridan oh i know what you're talking about he was the star of the
*  movie we didn't know who he was right i did that fucking movie that's right i forgot i did that
*  and i said to you who's this fucking guy or something that's right and you said i don't know
*  and he i think he overheard us he was the star of the movie what movie i forget the name of it but
*  he's a good guy dave sharridan very good guy a really good guy very funny guy but i didn't
*  i you know i said who's he and i think he overheard us who's he's a comic actor yeah you know and a
*  funny guy and paul rubens came out and he said it's a great room guys and we were just sitting
*  there i didn't get it you got it yeah that was an interesting take because that guy was a he was a
*  young guy and he had never been the star of a movie before and they were making this movie
*  and because they the you know they put money into this the executives were giving him line readings
*  there was a guy who was wearing cufflinks an expensive watch and this really nice tailored suit
*  and he was saying he was telling him how to be funny that was rob simons that was probably the
*  producer i don't know because i worked i did a movie with him see spot run and this was after
*  that that's who it was did he need line readings or the guy was just being an asshole he was just
*  being a fucking guy with money he's lucky he didn't get smacked for something like that
*  certain situations you don't do that well i think you know the guy wanted to do the movie
*  it was he was happy to be the star of the movie and he just took it remember when they gave
*  dominic a line reading he flipped dominic's the most calm dominic kinase he played uncle jr the
*  most calm guy just sweetheart and somebody gave him line readings and he flipped out i was uh i
*  was in the car we're in the camera car and i was driving on the new jersey turnpike you know they
*  were towing the carpet you know the camera was here and i was stuck i couldn't get out and the
*  director came over and dominic was going don't tell me how to do it just tell me what you want
*  and this is the nicest man in the history right and he was going don't tell me how to do it just
*  tell me what you want what is the thing about actors with line readings because then you get
*  you're now you're not discovering it you're not you're not creating the moment you're just
*  imitating it so it's not organic and it's not might not be as interesting as what you're going
*  to come up with as an actor but it doesn't bother it doesn't bother me so much a lot of directors
*  don't know how to deal with actors so they think that that's helpful but it's it's actually the
*  opposite it's not helpful because when like when they give you a line reading they would actually
*  say the line the way they want sometimes they won't and you know what that doesn't bother me
*  i mean i flip out it hasn't happened much i've gone off on directors for that and listen
*  especially with a sitcom which i find very difficult i find one hour dramas i i i like
*  that so much more sitcoms a different rhythm a different beat i don't think i'm very good at it
*  and i've done quite a bit of them uh you know the guy's giving me a note to give me i said just tell
*  me tell me what you want man how do you say tell me how to say it right i'll do what you want
*  because obviously i'm not getting what you want i want to make the director happy i want to do a
*  good job tell me it doesn't bother me that much you know i i have had directors uh i did a movie
*  with a young kid it was a really good role a younger kid after every take he came over to
*  talk to me finally i went like just let me fucking do my thing i'll figure it out just yeah they're
*  not appreciative of the fact that you've got to think about what you're doing and if you they're
*  yapping at you then you're thinking about them and it interrupts this whole process absolutely
*  you freak out though michael yeah because as an actor you have to you're playing the scene the
*  reality of the scene whatever it is this guy's saying something and it pisses you off so right
*  that's what you're trying to create that's what you're trying to do someone tells you say the
*  line like this well then i'm not in the moment i'm not dealing with this i'm just thinking about
*  imitating this douchebag who just told me to say something a certain way you know what i mean i had
*  a director said to me uh make a comical face and i said i don't know what that means do you want me
*  to be happy do you want me to be ecstatic over the top really excited make a funny face and then i
*  said i i don't know what that means i think he said be more cartoonish and then he said uh he said
*  well i'm not really good at uh i swear to god he said i'm not really good at giving direction i said
*  that's your job that's actually the title of the job is direction well this do you feel like as an
*  actor it's a it's a strange thing to do because you're creating something but it's also this
*  collaborative effort you're working with the other actors but you're also working with the director
*  there's the script that you're supposed to be following and maybe there's some changes to the
*  script and there's so much going on to try to create your version of it that the more that
*  people are fucking with you the more that's gonna just throw you off the rails it does and i what i
*  found is the best people the best director best actors and writers make it so you feel very
*  comfortable and that you are free to create and that you're not being dominated or dictated to
*  and stuff like that like for instance the best example is martin scorsese who i i only worked
*  with once in a movie i felt like i could do no wrong he creates that environment where you feel
*  completely creative and free and that's it doesn't get better than him you know doesn't get better i
*  would imagine that that's a that's a real skill that you hone to be able to look at it from the
*  the artist's perspective from the the actor's perspective and just to just to figure out how
*  to be the least annoying the most supportive and then just sort of convey what you're trying to
*  get done in the scene 100 i mean both ways you know as an actor too you got to learn you know
*  you learn how to deal with different types of directors and give give them what they want and
*  give and satisfy yourself at the same time when you're not a skill when you're learning it's
*  harder to do that you know i got fired from my very first professional job i was 21 i had been
*  studying for a long time i've been auditioning never got anything i get a play and i was a lead
*  in a play off broadway but it got a lot of attention because it was based on a true story
*  and i got fired after the opening weekend because i didn't respect the director i thought he i didn't
*  think he knew what he was doing and i didn't know how to give him what he needed and still do my
*  own thing i wasn't skilled enough yet so they fired me it was devastating but you know a lot
*  but a lot of like i work with clenice with a few times and it's with the casting he's relying on
*  you that's why he cast you so a lot of a lot of a lot of directors even big ones they don't even
*  give you any direction they hired you you did your thing yeah absolutely you did your thing and now
*  go ahead take it away i mean you know and and it's a lot like he believes it's a lot with the casting
*  michael directed me in a movie that he wrote it couldn't have been better what movie is this
*  called the hungry ghost a very low indie very indie movie we did in new york in 2008
*  and steve was one of the leads and it was it was great i mean you know it was all new york actors
*  and uh what's that what was it about you know five people that'll fucking lost their life is
*  lost i played a guy that uh was a radio late night radio host that that's a coke guy and drunk you
*  could be a great radio dj with that voice problem problem with his kids but it was great we rehearsed
*  at his at the time he had a theater we rehearsed because we didn't have a lot of money at times
*  we rehearsed we got out on the street we did it and michael was terrific he knows what he wants i
*  mean that's the biggest mistake a director could make if they're hesitant you know they gotta know
*  what they want before they come over and talk to you you know you know what i mean there's a guy
*  hemming and horan you know it's like what the fuck but talking about line reading there was an
*  actor a broadway guy that did the sopranos a small role uh and i was it was in a scene with me and
*  uncle jr and uh and this guy and they were actually giving him line readings he was a broadway actor
*  and he wasn't getting it and they wind up dubbing his voice oh they dubbed his voice yes i forget
*  the guy's name when we get to the episode i'll tell you but that's insane yeah but you know what
*  else happened on the show numerous times like i did uh i did a scene with the rapper fabulous
*  and he was great there was a scene where i shot the guy in the ass i don't know if you remember
*  that i remember that yeah all right uh i'm supposed to shoot him in the thigh because i'm a marksman
*  and i get money from him and i shoot him in the ass by mistake but i shot it with fabulous and then
*  a few weeks later they said listen you got to reshoot that scene so right away i go wow
*  i fucked up no they changed fabulous to treach treach naughty by nature yeah good guy they they
*  said he looked too young they just replaced them they just they had the the budget and the time and
*  they just i brought in another actor and they would rewrite scenes if they didn't like the
*  scene after they saw it they would be righted and and uh numerous times they brought another
*  actors there's two different fbi agents uh foroosa balk you know that actress yeah she was at the end
*  of episode season three or something she never came back not only did they they took her off the
*  dvd so unless you taped it you know like if you taped it back then they reshot her scenes they
*  reshot her scenes even for the dvd so she unless she has a vhs of it somewhere she's non-existent
*  that's crazy because she's a really good actress too no it wasn't it probably wasn't anything to do
*  with that it was they didn't make a deal with her maybe she was busy making a movie i'm not saying
*  it was she's got a huge mouth yeah she was a smile she's a huge she was in waterboy waterboy
*  yeah that's right she was great in that i just watched that me and my family went out because
*  we were you know stayed at home for the covet thing we had movie night every night we went on
*  an adam sandler binge funny watched everything underrated fucking funny movie that's a funny
*  movie the wedding singers the zoan is hilarious that's a funny great movie brushing your teeth
*  with hummus yes lanny kazan he's banging lanny kazan that's a really funny movie it's a very
*  funny movie cooking yeah barbecuing naked with the fish and nick is very funny oh yeah next
*  was great fun nick is awesome i love nick yeah who was the comics that that inspired you to be a
*  comedian or prior first uh my parents took me to see live in the sunset strip in the movie theater
*  when i was like 15 he was brilliant oh yeah beyond you never met him yeah i did i worked with him i
*  worked with him five weeks in a row actually wow towards the end of his life it was uh it was very
*  odd for me because that was the that was what really got me interested in stand-up because
*  in that movie theater thinking i'd never really seen stand-up before i don't think you know maybe
*  i'd seen it on the tonight show or something like that but i'd never really seen that and in this
*  movie theater here i am crying laughing at this guy that was just talking and i was like i can't
*  believe he's just talking because every you know if i'd seen a funny movie it was funny but it was
*  never that funny i remember you said something about something about mary we you had just seen
*  something about mary and we were talking and you go it's like a comic killing i'll never forget you
*  said that like it's so funny it was like a comic killing yeah that was the feeling that i got
*  watching prior was like i can't believe how funny this guy is just talking like i never i didn't
*  know you could do that and you worked with him at the comedy store working with the comedy store
*  towards the end of his life where he was really sick and they used to have to crank the volume
*  up in the microphone like really loud he would get on stage and he was on all kinds of medication
*  because you know he was sick and he had to sit down because he couldn't literally couldn't stand
*  up they just carry him to the stage so they'd introduce him and they'd walk him through the
*  crowd and i worked with him for five weeks i was on after him every night like every night it was
*  prior than me because you know mincy sure who owned the comedy store when she had a young comic
*  that she liked she would shove you after anybody was any good so if martin lawrence was on i was
*  on after him if richard prior was on i was on after so you auditioned did you audition for the
*  improv and and comedy no i didn't have to you didn't have to audition for the improv the audition
*  the improv you know you just if you had tv credits and stuff like that they'd give you but that was
*  later on but at the beginning when you first got to la no when i first got out of here i had a tv
*  show i was on i was on a show called hardball oh that's right that's right what mike saw
*  mike exactly mike star shout out to mike and that got cancelled and then i got on news radio right
*  afterwards so the whole time that i was out here i was on a sitcom and so the improv i could just
*  get spots but i wanted to be at the store the store was mecca that was did you ever see that movie some
*  kind of hero with richard prior yes and he plays like a vietnam i think it's about a vietnam vet or
*  something it's kind of a drama i think it's a drama and he's he's great he was a great actor
*  he was great in everything he was it was great in that what was that movie that they did about his
*  life story where he chose joe johan oh right that was really yeah that was basically a drama that's
*  right that was good he's the goat in my opinion i mean they're like lennie bruce who started all off
*  and then there's kineson it was probably like the funniest of all time for like two years before he
*  burnt out but then prior is the guy you know when you look at like the guy who changed comedy he
*  made comedy a personal thing he made comedy like an honest personal thing he was the first one you
*  think yeah he was he took what lennie bruce was doing and he just did it a little bit better
*  you know lennie bruce opened the door though lennie bruce was the guy who got arrested for it lennie
*  bruce was the guy who really changed perceptions in the you know when in the 50s and the 60s what
*  he was doing was revolutionary there was no one that was doing anything like pushing up all those
*  boundaries yeah everyone else was telling jokes like two jews walking to a bar they buy it but i'm
*  sure that was what they all shared each other's jokes it was cats go comics exactly ed sullivan
*  and that's what all that was but he was pointing out hypocrisy in society and political things
*  and things about language yes language yeah but even he started out as an impressionist yes yeah
*  yeah he he just decided to expand the medium and then he got more and more famous from doing that
*  and then it more became social commentary that was actually funny rather than just what we had
*  thought of as a stand-up comedian before that and then of course carlin took it from there and then
*  i think prior did it better than anybody else he really opened the door for so many other comedians
*  and he made it personal yeah yeah yeah he like almost confessional and introspective and vulnerable
*  and vulnerable as an actor he brought that to yeah yeah in everything he did i mean he was
*  uh is they destroyed lenny bruce they just destroyed him you know the lawsuits and the
*  lawsuits at the end that's what he was actually reading he had a big problem so well he was a
*  heroin addict but i mean but they just destroyed him on top of it i mean i mean they were arresting
*  him for cursing yeah just if you think about that now yeah you know have you seen uh marvelous mrs
*  mazel the amazon series it's really good yeah the guy that plays lenny bruce is good he's really
*  good who is it who's i don't know the actor's name he's really good jame will find out um but the
*  the way they portray him is very close to how he really was yeah and that he he was very loved by
*  people that would come to see him and then the cops would literally drag him off stage what do you
*  think of her stand-up on the show um well in the beginning i think it was pretty good it it seemed
*  like a funny broad who was kind of drunk who went on stage who was hilarious and and and got laughs
*  it's just hard to recreate stand-up if you don't do stand-up yeah that's what that's very hard but
*  that's what i was talking about as a comedic actor there he is you know he's very good very good he
*  even looks like him there yeah he's very he was also on the deuce he played a good role on a deuce
*  on hbo on the uh the one thing about mrs mazel uh everything is a uh
*  uh she's like on all the time yeah that's the one thing it's like always a funny you never saw the
*  show it's a good show but it's always like a funny quip everything you ask if she wants coffee is a
*  funny job that's like another like a comic that's always on right it's annoying you got those fucking
*  i got to the third season the third season it seemed like it was a little manufactured like
*  there's this big scene where she's in front of a uso tour yeah overseas and these guys are laughing
*  she's just murdering laughing everything and as a comic i'm like this is not this isn't real this
*  isn't real this is like a kung fu scene where guys kicking guys through windows you know you know it's
*  like there's something about it like i can't i can't relate to this anymore you've taken this into
*  fiction uh but i think the beginning of it was really good joe have you uh ever just aided on
*  stage oh yeah i don't mean at the beginning oh i hate shit yeah of course well this is one thing
*  i write a new act every two years so i do a netflix special or comedy central special
*  i throw all that stuff out and i start all over again and you're gonna have some rough sets
*  yeah i eat shit and then you know maybe you have a heckler you get mad at the heckler and eat shit
*  do you have go-to heckler you know shut up heckler lines i mean you can do that but really it's all
*  in what's happening in the moment they're so different you know that it's like do you have
*  a go-to spice for your food well it really depends on what you're eating what you're doing
*  yeah i mean it's really there's bells uh worked at bells are worked at the rift i know what you're
*  gonna say and a lady was heckling him and he says lady the only time you should open your mouth is
*  to switch sticks do you remember the comic uh rick reynolds no rick reynolds was uh hot stuff
*  uh he had a one-man show he was the beginning of that played the improvs like i'm going in the 90s
*  and he had this uh i forget the name of it maybe i don't know what the name of it is rick reynolds
*  he was a san francisco guy and he was working yeah and he had he was he had a development deal
*  and i think even a sitcom for a short time and he had an act and the act was kind of like you know
*  he would he kind of came off like a studious guy and then he would say uh would you uh sleep with
*  me for a dollar you know you tell a girl you know how about for five dollars then of course
*  for a million dollars would you go on me and of course she says you're a whore you're a whore
*  so he tells so he tells the guy he does the joke he gets off stage a guy her boyfriend comes back
*  and punches him in the back of the head right at the riviera right and then two nights later
*  a guy's heckling him he tells the guy if you don't shut up i'm gonna leave that's what he tells the
*  guy that's how we dealt with the heckling and the guy kept heckling and he walked off the stage
*  yeah and i was fucking pissed off at him that seems like a very odd approach yeah
*  yeah he said one more time and i swear i'm basically giving up all your power to the heckler
*  yeah that's uh that's that's probably why he's not around anymore yeah but he was managing
*  he in the 90s he had this one man show maybe late 80s development deal big management you know
*  do you remember that guy who had developed he had a show called defending the caveman
*  oh yeah rigor on becker yeah i never saw it but a lot of people did see it and they told me that
*  he did it for a while and then he sold the show and someone else was doing it oh yeah numerous
*  people he did in vegas there was a guy did it for years i think the guy the fuck's his name the the
*  bald guy who's in the thing he was on the shield oh michael uh chicliss chicliss yeah he did it for
*  a while yeah that's a one man show yeah i was like it was about women and men yeah it went to
*  broadway yeah he made a fortune it was basically though like stock premises of standard i didn't
*  see it yeah that's what it was explained to me someone said this is the craziest thing i've
*  ever seen in my life but it became it's making millions all over the world all over the world
*  and it's basically like you know standard premises men are like this but women are like that
*  that's like real standard shit that if you saw rodak doing you would go oh this guy's kind of
*  a hack but then meanwhile this guy's doing it as a one-man show and it's a theatrical production
*  so it's huge i don't know if that's an accurate assessment of it that's what it was explained to
*  me but he also hired so he was kind of a you know not fat but kind of a you know chunky kind of
*  guy and the other guys that filled in were all like that body size though like the same body
*  it wasn't a skinny good-looking guy they were all like kind of the same imagine if don mirara did
*  that like if you have some guy playing don well didn't gallagher do it gallagher did it with his
*  twin brother and then he sued the brother yeah maybe not his twin but it's his brother and they
*  look alike yes who's gallagher too and then after a while he got tired of gallagher too doing his
*  act like hey give me my fucking act back fuck you yeah so then they were fighting i never knew that
*  yes gallagher he was touring and doing oh yeah he looked like gallagher you couldn't really tell
*  cloned gallagher but something went wrong in the process like something was like slightly off like
*  if you know you were married to him and you came home one day and you're like hey are you okay what's
*  going on he'd be like you're not my husband what is happening here don mirara too that is there
*  should be don mirara's all over the country we'll send them out headlining everywhere there's gallagher
*  too which one's which i don't know which one's which i'd say on the right i think that's on the
*  right is two so the guy on the right he had to grow his fucking hair the same way and wear the
*  same clothes and what was he was one better than the other or was i never saw it i'd like to see
*  a review have you had gallagher on no i haven't no he's a i've heard him on stern before though
*  he's an interesting guy very opinionated he uh but i gotta tell you he took that prop thing to
*  another level yes he did well him him between like carrot top i say just he ruled he i don't want to
*  say ruin the genre of prop comics but he defined it to the point where no one else can be a prop
*  comic anymore when i was starting out in 88 there was prop comics there was all these guys they're
*  like some guys would have music some guys that have props there was some guys have had a puppet
*  you know they'd go on stage with the puppet there was a normal thing but there's no fucking prop
*  comics anymore oh no go down to the comic store on a monday night you don't see a single prop comic
*  they don't exist no more ventriloquist that's rare too i mean i don't know who i guess it was uh what's
*  his name jeff dunham jeff dunham is like he's the premier puppet guy he's a hall of fame yeah he's
*  a hall of fame republic guy he used to work for me at the rev did you ever have auto and georgian
*  he's the best he was he was a great guy he was a puppet act he he had the dirtiest puppet the
*  puppet would say the most fucked up shit and then he would go how can you say that it was
*  and he worked for me a lot remember we used to the show you did at the red
*  dirty show it was the extreme comedy xxx so i had all these filthy guys matter of fact i was talking
*  to nick depalo nick did it you know there he is there's auto and george there's auto and george
*  it's so crazy it's it's so funny someone actually ran on stage at the uh at danger fields and stabbed
*  the comp the puppet one time yeah yeah they were so mad yeah they were so mad and it's so horrifying
*  look how scary that crazy eyebrows and when he would he would fucking the eyebrows would go up
*  when he was hitting his punch lines and it's auto and george and you'd think that the the puppet's
*  name would be auto but that's george yeah puppet is george but auto uh he worked for me a bunch of
*  times and he had problems and he would disappear oh he couldn't find him he was on the west side
*  of town and he died young died young and but he he did let him in you know he started finally after
*  so many years getting some recognition i wish he was around now so we could introduce him through
*  podcasts i think i think if he was around now you know if i if i could get him on a podcast and show
*  people who is it much like joey dies much like a lot of these guys you're not going to understand
*  who they are through a traditional format like a regular television format you're getting to get a
*  shadow of what they really are you got to see like auto was a wild guy who did these crazy fucking
*  crazy road shows we did uh we did those bob gonzo gigs together and jersey and we did uh we did
*  danger fields for those we we did prom shows prom shows are the fucking worst thing a comic could
*  ever do because what they do is they take these 17 and 18 year old kids they're at their prom
*  you went to one they don't change the audience so the audience they just keep shoving new kids in
*  there and hope the other kids live leave rather so you'll start working you might have a seven
*  o'clock show and you don't get out of there until like two three in the morning sometimes you get
*  out of there it's just starting to turn daylight and they're just pumping kids in so they would
*  tell you don't change your act we want them to be bored of your act so they leave we get new kids
*  who was that that australian guy tony what was the big guy um it was the the it was scottish a scottish
*  yeah fuck what was his name not told god damn it wasn't told tony was rodney's partner he was
*  funnier than most of the comedians the the big scottish powerlifter guy he would uh he he would
*  lift weights with he would take cement buckets like a like a bucket and fill it with cement and
*  he would do a lot of his workouts just lifting these buckets filled with cement one of the
*  strongest fucking guys i've ever seen in my life he was like built like a bowling ball with a head
*  on the top of it he was the manager no he was like a doorman slash matri d slash bouncer so if anybody
*  did anything wrong he was the guy that came in and i saw him pick a kid up by his neck literally
*  grab him by his neck and lift him up in the air and the kid's feet were dangling he's just trying
*  yeah danger fields uh i went there many years ago in the 70s and i saw david fry you know david
*  fry no he used to do nixon he was five foot three and he would do fucking nixon the headline sees
*  his palace really look him up david fry and uh he wind up moving to vegas and he was
*  sullivan all the time and and he did nixon he was great really short uh right and uh
*  he was always lonely and he was with randy kretico you know so randy kretico was an
*  impressionist the two of them the guy with roger stone yeah randy used to work for me at the rib
*  he was a comedian yes a stand-up impressionist he did johnny carson i saw him on carcent there's
*  david fry he's five foot three they go over they're down in times square it's four in the
*  morning 4 30 in the morning there's a hooker on the corner they pull up they said how much uh
*  for a blowjob the girl is looking in she's looking in the car how much to fuck you she went i don't
*  fuck midgets boom he was lost for the night he was depressed for two fucking months david
*  he was a bad alcoholic and he worked at the rib when we first opened when we first opened right
*  uh he worked it was like his big comeback because he was living in vegas he used to come around the
*  club and he did the first show wore a tuxedo uh and between shows he got bombed and uh bud
*  bud freeman said go and get him you know we gave him a chance and he just couldn't even work he was
*  poor guy and he passed away a few years ago but yeah he was headlight ceaseless ballast a real
*  comic wow a very depressed never married he would say life is hard life is hard life is hard there's
*  a lot of those stereotype comics and you would hear about them more back in the day than now
*  that we're never happy they would go on stage they would get laughs in the crowd then they'd
*  be depressed for the rest of the night hey uh you know that that kind of bonumpup comic i mean there
*  was a lot more work then i think i don't know you know i mean now you had cat schools you had
*  nightclubs in new york chicago you know i mean there was a lot tv paid more money then you didn't
*  get scale i think if you did a variety show then you got real money you know like flip wilson show
*  or sonny and chair and there was a comic con i think there was you know flip wilson remember
*  flip wilson oh look i'm old i told you i was old i'm an old man flip wilson sonny and chair
*  i love those shows i remember those shows yeah you know all those variety shows in the uh you
*  know in the 70s i mean that was good stuff what happened to variety shows i don't think people
*  like them anymore i don't know they short attention spans i guess that's the new american idol and the
*  voice and shit that's sort of but the variety shows would have like legitimate famous acts come on
*  yeah singers yeah singers comics then they had the guy with the plates magician yeah they would do
*  things puppet you know ventriloquist yeah joe roe that's what you gotta do joe variety act that's
*  the next thing i can't i do that i do enough this is it it can't be a short attention span because
*  if that was the case then podcasts wouldn't work because podcasts require the most attention span
*  now do you do you that's the one thing without podcasts too a lot of younger people are discovering
*  the sopranos and that was part of the reason we wanted to do one there's kids that are in their
*  late teens early 20s yeah you know like that age and they're the podcast yeah and they were too
*  young when the show was on originally but that that's pretty cool because a lot of shows don't
*  get that kind of resurgence and new generation discovering it well it's the beautiful thing
*  about our era that you can stream shows and binge them you can do that with back in our day like if
*  you wanted to watch old episodes of starsky and hutch good luck sure where are you gonna find them
*  where are you gonna find dragnet you had to wait for it to be on television if you wanted to watch
*  an older show you had to wait for it or you find it somewhere now someone tells you about the
*  sopranos i i is it on netflix no it's on hbo max hbo and hbo hulu and probably apple tv as well
*  yeah you probably buy it on apple tv amazon amazon yeah so but you just go right to that boom you
*  get started i mean and instantly starts playing i mean it's it's amazing if you're a kid and you
*  want to discover great old shows or great old films i mean you have instant access to them you
*  don't have to go anywhere absolutely you know but back then only 11 million people had hbo
*  yeah which is nothing there's probably more people now watching the show yeah you know people get
*  together on sunday nights right they have their parties and all that and yeah you know they would
*  cook and have parties and dress up like the characters and it's just it was harder to watch
*  things you had to go out and get a physical physical copy of like i remember uh i moved into
*  this house in 2002 and it had a theater and i i was like oh my god i made it i got a fucking
*  theater in my house this is the shit and i watched apocalypse now part the uh the the newly remack
*  remastered version of apocalypse now the one with the added scenes that were in the french plantation
*  oh yeah that was really cool i was just sitting back watching this thing going this is amazing
*  at the and then and you find out the history of the film and then you find out that like literally
*  it took like seven years to make that yeah laurence fishburn's a teenager when he's in it
*  you know it's just fuck what a movie that is yeah that's a good one look at his career actually
*  harvey kytel was originally the martin sheen role willard and actually shot for a while uh and got
*  fired um i think they felt he brought too much like martin sheen was more of a blank slate like
*  an everyman kind of harvey had a very strong like personality like new york kind of tough guy and
*  a lot more of a quirks to him and martin he wanted more of like martin sheen was more of like a
*  reacting to all the other craziness around him like hopper and franjik forrest and fishburne
*  and brando and he was kind of the center that just held it and harvey was more like a character
*  that makes sense that's at least what i heard but they should i think harvey shot for
*  at least a month maybe more wow wow that makes sense though because harvey's such a powerful
*  yeah when i think of harvey kytel i think a bad lieutenant yeah that's a good one fucking movie
*  that's a brilliant shit well he did a series with him what did you do with i did a series
*  his the only series he ever did called life on mars we did one season for abc in in 2009
*  and harvey was uh played the uh lieutenant he played lieutenant in that and it was his first
*  tv show it was good to work with yeah i worked with him before i worked with him on clockers i had a
*  couple of scenes with him in that and then we did i love harvey harvey's a very hard worker
*  takes his work work really really seriously and really good i mean bad lieutenant he's
*  incredible brilliant i think that might be his best work ever and dangerous game did you ever
*  see that it's the same director abel ferrara it's with madonna and james russo harvey basically
*  plays a version of abel ferrara and kind of a version of himself and he's really he plays a
*  film director he's really good i don't know if i saw that i have to go look at that again
*  that's a good one yeah what did you think of uh the stand-up show on uh showtime which one
*  what was that called what do you mean uh it was the gym yeah yeah you didn't like it no i thought
*  it was flat yeah i kind of liked it i mean i like seeing some of the guys a lot of my good friends
*  right yeah i'm sure i like that i liked it because it was basically based on the store
*  but uh was he a stand-up comedian jim carrey yes he was before he started doing
*  like that right i don't i don't know i didn't even get into it you didn't watch the show no
*  okay what how did they have her act you know like impossible you know she was crazy yeah you know
*  i met her a few times she was nice to me because she came out with paulie paulie worked at the
*  hotel so i met a couple times she was always very nice that's her on the wall oh is it when she was
*  younger yeah yeah she was always very very nice to me but uh was she crazy oh yeah yeah that's why
*  she let the store become what it is she basically wanted the lunatics to run the asylum she wanted
*  them to fight against each other she also know like say if you and michael had a problem with
*  each other she put you on back to back she had michael bring you up really if yeah if you were
*  dating if a comic was dating another comic she'd have them back to back if they if they broke up
*  and it was all this was all orchestrated yeah well she had a theory about comedy she wanted
*  people to be put into difficult situations that's why i told you when i was 27 and you know just
*  sort of getting my feet under me she had me going after richard prier every fucking night and martin
*  lawrence she liked you she'd put she'd throw you to the wolves wow and she she would laugh about
*  it too like later on in life you know uh i had a conversation with her and she was laughing she's
*  i always knew where to point you she thought it was funny but that was it was also how she made
*  you a good comic she she forced you to adapt to the moment if you just go on if you have a
*  easy opening act who does get some laughs it doesn't kill too hard and you know you go on
*  this cushy spot in the middle everything is soft and easy you don't get challenged you don't grow
*  and she wanted you to grow she wanted you to she wanted you to face hardship she wanted you to
*  fucking sink or swim bitch this is the comedy store and that's how she treated it you know but
*  the store uh which was the mecca of course and then then it tailed off a little bit and then
*  yeah when you and joey diaz and all you guys started coming back now it's the spot yeah oh
*  you know before the pandemic anyway that's the spot in the whole united states when i came back
*  in 2014 we had already been talking about it for so long on the podcast it had kind of had a little
*  bit of a ramp up before then but then when i came back and we were basically telling everybody hey
*  i'm at the store we're there we're there you know five nights a week yeah it just became mobbed
*  again i mean it was mobbed every fucking night it was sold out hundreds of days in a row three shows
*  one in the one in the original room big show in the main room belly room just packed just every
*  night you couldn't get in there they had the uh you know they were at the dunes they were before
*  the improv yeah and there was like five headliners you know they would have like dom and uh you know
*  kineson or mitchell walters or you know and they they were at the dunes hotel in the big room and
*  mitzi four walled that so she made all the money and she was very smart obviously a smart business
*  woman yeah she didn't go for the you know guaranteed money she took a shot and for years
*  that was the spot to be when did that place go under that was before my time and then
*  i would say in the 90s early 90s they knocked the dunes down but i think it started in 84 the improv
*  opened in 86 and they would have five out line uh headliners johnny doc uh you know all you know all
*  the uh headliners from the comedy store jimmy walker you know well vegas is making a comeback
*  when it comes to comedy like there's a lot of clubs yeah there's clubbing like jimmy kimmel's
*  got a club there now and then there's a comedy seller uh laugh factory brad garrett yeah the
*  brad garrett place is great it's like it's a good place for not just for people that are doing big
*  places but for comic comics guys road guys are just you know hey you when you did dice the show
*  you saw rich little yeah we all went um the cat i was shooting playing in the lab factory
*  at the tropicana right yeah yeah yeah dice does residencies there like he'll be there for months
*  at a time at the lab factory i was just i was just there in vegas for the ufc uh two weeks ago and uh
*  you know they're doing a ufc without a crowd it's very strange you know we're at the apex center
*  which is uh it's it's an arena that the ufc built it's like where is it it's uh next to the ufc
*  performance institute it's off the strip and uh they just they built this very small arena so they
*  do it's a series of other shows besides just the big ufc pay-per-views they do this thing called
*  the dana white tuesday night contender series where they have like up and coming comics or fighters
*  rather up and coming fighters compete and then they do it in a small place with a very small crowd
*  and uh you know like a thousand 1200 people but now there's no one no crowd because it's the only
*  way you could do the thing so as i'm driving to the the apex center i'm passing the tropicana and
*  they've got dice up on the billboard for february so it's like long past shows march shit like that
*  they don't even take it down they haven't even because everything's been shut down all the
*  casinos have been shut down now they're now they're opening yeah so did you have a hotel to stay in
*  no i didn't even i flew in the day of the fights i flew out that night yesterday i watched a soccer
*  game the german league and they had no fans but they had a recording of the fans oh that's so
*  weird which is and you know they sing the fans in europe sing chance with the team they had that
*  going on but there's nobody in the audience are they going to do that for us no no it's just silent
*  no no recording of cheers and the brilliant part about it being silent is that you can hear the
*  people breathing you can hear them talking shit to each other like hey pussy hey pussy how you
*  feeling like they talk shit to each other when they're beating each other up you can hear the
*  body blows you can hear the wheezing when they're getting hurt you can hear them heavy breathing
*  when they're tired like there's so much more depth to it when you don't have an audience
*  there's undeniable that the audience plays a big factor in the energy but there's something to
*  just being there like i was there for uh tony ferguson and justin gagey in florida we did that
*  in jacksonville and there was the same thing no audience but that was even weirder because it was
*  a 15 000 seat arena but there was no crowd it was just these guys duking it out in this cavernous
*  arena and the octagon set up in the center of the arena and all you hear is the corner men giving
*  advice and then you you hear them beating the shit out of each other do you have to adjust anything
*  you do different or you just do your thing i didn't no no i didn't adjust you know the only
*  difference is the one in vegas they wouldn't let me interview the fighters in the ring after the
*  fight so i couldn't go into the octagon after the fight i had to do it remotely so i had a headset
*  on i'm looking at them through a screen it was real weird yeah that was and do you think the ufc
*  that's why boxing is not popular anymore boxing is pretty popular not as it once was i think mma is
*  much more exciting but i think the real big boxing fights are still very exciting like uh
*  tyson fury diante wilder that kind of fight like this those are still very exciting like anytime
*  canelo alvarez fights those are still very exciting fights it's just it's it's not as
*  multi-dimensional as mma when you watch a ufc fight and you know you're seeing head kicks and
*  takedowns and guys and too rough for me man it's fucking tough that's tough those are legit tough
*  guys wasn't as exciting even before mma got popular but like had the heavyweight division
*  which used to be so for years so exciting you know well it comes in waves you know diante wilder was
*  just starting to become like the resurgence of the heavyweight division because he was smashing and
*  knocking everybody out and then they had that epic fight with him and tyson fury and they knocked
*  tyson fury down twice and almost knocked him out in the 12th round but then tyson came back in that
*  round and then the fight was declared a draw that was a good it was a great fight and then tyson
*  fury came back and beat the fuck out of him in the rematch and when that happened everyone is like
*  jesus christ now american heavyweights like that was a big american heavyweight loss right and
*  in america there's something about we don't give a fuck about heavyweights from other countries
*  like when vladimir klitschko like you would think like the whole thing was like a white guy
*  as a heavyweight champion would be the craziest shit ever vladimir klitschko was the heavyweight
*  champion for years nobody gave a fuck that's what i'm saying he was russian you know in the in the
*  i used to go to a lot of fights when i lived in vegas in the 80s i was at the herns haggler
*  i was at mancini when he killed duke kookim i was at that fight was the outside fight right yes
*  i was at the herns haggler i was at the cooney holmes oh wow hundred dollar seat guy tipped me
*  i was a doorman at paul lanker's club a bouncer guy gave me a hundred dollar ticket i was all the way
*  to tippy top at seizes in the parking lot that was the arena i was at aguello prior aguello yeah
*  alexis aguello prior wow i was at tyson's first fight when he came out of jail oh wow and he
*  beat the shit out of the irish kid yeah yeah uh yeah i was at a whole bunch of them a bunch and
*  then they would have saturday afternoons at the showboat on the outside of town i would go to a
*  lot of those were great fights then you know uh they had wednesday night fights at uh it was a
*  silver slipper where the mirages i used to go back then i haven't been to a fight in years
*  they used to have a lot of fights at the orleans too right orleans that was later on yeah later on
*  later on but uh the silver slipper was just a shithole local place there's a lot of those in
*  vegas and yeah a local place and they would have these great fighters they would come in from la
*  and uh top rank was big deal then and aram's been around you know forever ali came to the set one
*  day and sopranos visited he was a fan of the show and he he uh his manager contacted my manager and
*  i met him in front of the studio and brought him onto the set and nobody knew he was coming
*  and gandolfini was like in bed he was doing the when he was in the coma it was all that stuff
*  he was like taking a nap between takes and i brought ali and the whole crew just like froze
*  and then i brought him up to the bed and i tapped jim jim turned around looked up he went
*  holy shit and he hung out the whole day man took pictures every crew people gave him a standing
*  ova people were crying it was crazy wow he was such a star and such an iconic figure that
*  my parents who were hippies they didn't give a fuck about fighting but when he fought spinks
*  in the rematch they made us watch it we're living in san francisco i'm like you have to watch this
*  mahammoud ali is fighting leon spinks he's gonna he's gonna get his title back like it was a big
*  deal because he wasn't just a boxer like it's hard for people to realize that now in retrospect
*  but when i was a kid during the vietnam war he was also a symbol of the resistance to this unjust
*  war that we didn't want to be a part of as a guy who lost three years of his career because he
*  wouldn't fight in the war and so they stripped him of his title in his prime like he beat cleveland
*  big cat williams probably the finest performance of his young career and then for three years he
*  doesn't do shit until he comes back and you know was it was a he was more he transcended sports oh
*  absolutely all over the world all over the world and and he got his due i think though you know
*  what i mean he's he's recognized as that guy yeah you know it finally happened it took a while but
*  look at that oh there you go that must have been on the set yeah there's the hospital bed behind
*  that's crazy that was a dumb you can't make up some bullshit here they get right on you
*  that's good that is shaming gets right on your ass they fucking come up with the goods he's also a
*  cautionary tale for for boxers you know if you think that getting hit in the head has no consequences
*  when you know towards the end of his life it was very hard to watch oh sure yeah he wasn't talking
*  that much but he was very present like he was he was with it he just wasn't yeah he had neurological
*  he he wasn't capable of like really speaking well i think leon spinks also right yeah everyone joe
*  frazier towards the end of his career yeah horrible to watch him and listen to him the only one who's
*  avoided that is george foreman to this day george foreman speaks great he sounds normal which is
*  crazy it's hard what about uh holyfield holyfield's fighting again do you know that no way yes holyfield's
*  been training and he actually looks great you know with hormone replacement therapy they just juice
*  him up with testosterone and growth hormone and fucking get him on a good diet next thing you know
*  he's hitting the bag and looking great and i think they're trying to set up a tyson holyfield rematch
*  how old is holyfield holyfield's older than tyson i think tyson's 53 and i think holyfield's 56
*  that would be something they'll all get a huge payday because i think holyfield was broke too
*  right they're both broke yeah i mean i don't know if tyson's broken because tyson's been on the show
*  yes and holyfield both guys have been oh they've been on the show um tyson's got that tyson ranch
*  where he's basically a weed salesman now he's got this crazy ranch that he's a part of tyson ranch
*  they grow spectacular weed that box over in the corner that gold box that's a tyson weed ranch
*  box that he gifted me and uh he's got this whole like entertainment venue there they're going to do
*  shows there i just think something happened and he just decided he even said on the podcast i don't
*  even want to work out he was like because i don't want to reignite my ego and then something
*  fucking lit a fire under him and the next thing you know there's these videos that got resurfaced
*  of him hitting the pads and looks fucking have you seen it i did see it it looks fucking phenomenal
*  he's it's amazing and i tell you what now that would be a huge huge all over the world that would
*  be take my money take my money that would be something they probably do it in like saudi
*  i hope they do it i hope they do it why not there's interest in that yeah oh yeah for sure
*  where's tyson's ranch at it's in um it's in california like towards like the palm desert area
*  okay yeah because he lived in vegas for a lot of years yeah he used to play basketball there was a
*  place he's the worst basketball player i've ever seen i'm not kidding terrible just terrible you've
*  never seen me play oh okay maybe you uh and uh he used to play there was a place called the
*  sporting house behind the stardust and like everyone played there every celebrity that was
*  it was like a you know a pool and a you know racquetball all that shit and he would come and
*  play i would never fucking dare say a word to him but uh he used to try to play a lot of play
*  against him yeah yeah i played i played in college and you know all the guys from u and ove would
*  play that was like 100 pounds ago i could play tyson was just that's not his thing no
*  no what i i just found it really amazing that he decided at 53 he just wanted to fight again
*  and he said he's going to do some exhibitions and that was the thought process behind some you know
*  like five round exhibitions or something like that but it seems like he really wants to fight
*  wow i think as the process has gone on he's gotten better and better shape and now he's shredded
*  look look geez and he's got a podcast right yeah yeah he's really he's a really interesting guy
*  and he did a one-man show yep yeah he did his one-man show for a while spike lead director
*  this guy who's holding the pads for him is hafele cordero hafele cordero is the
*  lead trainer at king's mma he's a very famous uh mma trainer like one of the best striking
*  trainers in the sport yeah so he's he's working with a great guy but it's interesting that he
*  chose to work with an mma guy too that's that's really interesting cordero comes from this place
*  in curitiba brazil called shoot the box it's a very famous mma camp famous for the most
*  ferocious fighters in brazil and uh he's he's been training with tyson how how long did foreman fight
*  like till he was well he came back at 36 and everybody thought it was a joke he came back
*  300 and something pounds fat as fuck and just looked like everybody's like ah ha ha what is
*  he doing why is he doing this and then slowly as the fights went on he never got ripped but he got
*  smaller and smaller and then when he flatlined jerry cooney everybody was like holy fuck like
*  this he's real like this is real and then when he knocked out michael more he became the oldest
*  ever heavyweight champion and i believe he was 45 when he when he knocked out more and then he's
*  uh had his grills and he made a lot of money he made a fucking killing on those grills those
*  great for grilled chicken great cooks quick yeah if you're a little bachelor
*  they're great it's actually a pretty goddamn good idea uh that's very funny i mean it's not the best
*  way you know if you want to cook the most delicious food something now do you cook yeah oh yeah
*  what you went top chef chopped celebrity tournament so you're a chef chef no you just
*  like home chef but i'm good at taking what's there and making something out of it like random stuff
*  what are you into like what do you like to cook um i like italian food i like you know i mean
*  out here where you know you go to the farmers market there's all great stuff that's in season
*  all the time and i don't know soup i'm really good at soup really yeah whatever's i mean
*  and i did it because my wife doesn't cook she's you know she's a designer she's good at building
*  things so i if i wanted to eat good i had to learn how to cook because she's so you learned
*  out of necessity and then really got into it yeah not well i mean i got into it because i you know
*  i liked feeding like you know i liked eating good so but i did this i got offered to be on this show
*  i never i didn't even know this show my kids were like no you'd go and do this you'll win if you do
*  this show because you're good at like cooking with random ingredients and it was um 16 people
*  like one day it was actors four actors four comedians four athletes and four like musicians
*  then the winner from each day does the last day and how do they judge based on taste presentation
*  yeah three three professionals judge taste presentation uh creativity and what did you cook
*  well i did yeah i used ice cream i made a dessert you have to make this three rounds every day right
*  so it's an appetizer round a main course and then a dessert but for the desserts i made ice cream
*  and i put like booze in the ice cream and that got over really good like bourbon bourbon ice cream
*  vanilla bourbon nice tequila ice cream or something like that but they give you weird
*  shit like um in one you open this box and these ingredients you have to use
*  then you have a pantry with all the other like normal staples of all kinds of other vegetables
*  and like like what would be in the box um fake blood like candy blood or like an unpopped
*  uh dry corn on the cob unpopped you know like like it's like popcorn but not off the cob um squid
*  it was like um that's kind of more of a normal thing um so you have to have pretty well-rounded
*  well-rounded skills yeah and then it's timed but then the thing i didn't think about that's
*  the hardest thing of it is that there's cameras in your face the whole time which is really hard
*  and then if they follow you around also got to go move around the kitchen yeah you're trying to
*  cook really fast and do something someone's right here with a camera right that kind of thing what
*  do you what the fuck do you do with unpopped corn well i knew what to do with it which was good you
*  put it in a paper bag and then put it in the microwave and then you got popcorn and you could
*  do stuff with it but i had i had bought it at the farmer's market like the week before just by
*  chance oh wow so i knew what to do with it yeah i would have been fucked um and you cook for your
*  family you win 50 000 for charity that's that was the the thing but i wound up winning the
*  the last two people were me and brandy chastain you know she was on the u.s
*  women's soccer team not the recent one but back then she took off her shirt and was wearing the
*  sports bra that was the famous photo or something it was her and i were the two finalists did she
*  do that after the show that's her move she lost she does that with everything maybe she if she won
*  she may come in second no you don't do that when you come in second yeah you gotta do that for
*  first place i did it you should have pulled your balls out so when so when you're doing this
*  so when you're doing this you get all these ingredients like what what is your thought
*  process like what kind of you get the squid and the popcorn so you you how much time are you
*  getting by the way um for i think for the appetizer you have 15 minutes 15 minutes so you open up the
*  box you got 15 minutes to make something you're gonna make so you're looking at the squid you're
*  looking at the popcorn like fuck yeah and you have to make and then there's uh there's all
*  different machines too there's like a food processor there's an ice cream machine there's
*  like a sous vide machine which is you put stuff in a in the plastic seal it and then put it into
*  like really hot water and cook it that kind of shit if you want to get adventurous yeah wow you
*  better try one try one of these shows no not for you no no what do you make usually i cook a lot of
*  meat you know i hunt so i eat a lot of elk meat because if i shoot an elk i get 400 pounds of meat
*  i wonder what does an elk taste like like steak uh no no it's more like venison like a deer meat
*  but more delicious is it the is it the deer family yes it is the deer family it's just a large deer
*  essentially a large mountain deer used to be a plains animal but then when people started
*  coming around and development they started moving into the mountains so now they're more of a mountain
*  animal but they're the real habitat is like grazing and plains but it's an enormous animal you know
*  so that'll be a lot of that you get a lot of deer how long does it last you a year a year yeah one
*  one elk will let but i give a lot of it away too i have a bunch of commercial freezers in the back
*  that's an elk on the wall that i shot i was big yeah it's a big animal i mean that's probably a
*  900 pound animal that one that's a really big one but some of them you know a good size utah
*  mountain elk 800 pounds so you quarter it up you take the family likes it yeah they love it yeah i
*  got good at it i know how to cook yeah yeah that's a specific style of cooking too because you got to
*  make sure you don't overcook it because it's very lean it's not like a like a fatty piece of meat
*  where you you know you could kind of cook it longer you cook it a low heat and you get it to
*  a very specific internal temperature usually i like like 125 degrees then i sear it on the outside a
*  very hot cast iron pan i don't cook much no no no and i don't eat anything you know listen i eat
*  not much or sometimes i could i could do something i could make breakfast like what what's your go
*  to make fucking eggs i could you know i could i could do something here if i got a work as a cook
*  like a short order cook you are a clam shucker i worked at umberto's clam house when i was in high
*  school i used to be able to open clams you know when you would order i used to be incredible at
*  them yeah umberto's clam house was where they killed joe gallo oh wow but they had a second
*  one in brooklyn where i grew up and uh no but gallo has killed a mulberry street mulberry street
*  there was one on mulberry street umberto's clam house it became famous after that and then there
*  was one in brooklyn and i was like 15 and i as we used to hang around on the corner and they were
*  building it and there was like a guy you know we were all hanging around getting into fucking
*  trouble a bunch of kids and he pulled out a big wad of money one day i mean like fucking
*  hundreds and he said come here come on get the fuck out of here take them to the movies
*  back then the movie was probably a dollar you know and i said no no no i want a job i don't
*  want your money and i gave him the money he was maddie the horse which was a big wise guy's brother
*  joe and he kind of became like a mentor you know he was like a really good guy gave me a job
*  i learned how to open clams baked clams uh clams for the linguine and clams raw clams on a half
*  shell but you know squeezed a lemon the thing i did being around a lot of those guys when you're
*  younger did that help you when you were in the sopranos that it helped you like sort of because
*  you knew people like that yeah i grew up in that neighborhood like where i grew up in betts and
*  harris brooklyn at the time in the 70s was all a big mob enclave big they were everywhere and you
*  didn't even know who they were you know like joey's uncle and this is a guy that i went to
*  little league with wind up doing 25 years for murder and they were just in the neighborhood
*  they would just you know so yeah i i knew that world i wasn't in that world i went to college i
*  you know but i knew that world i know people i have friends uh you know it was just that kind
*  of a place you know where you just knew them and somebody was just telling me two days ago
*  the guy uh owned a store like italian deli ravioli store and i didn't know that he was a hitman
*  and he sent me an article and he murdered two fucking guys in corny island yeah this guy named
*  pete and i had no idea about that and uh i said really he lived up the block for me i didn't know
*  because you know when you were a kid you know there was like you know he was coaching the
*  baseball team then you found out later i said i didn't know the guy was a wise guy like a real
*  guy and they were everywhere they sold fireworks and you know it was that whole thing it was
*  all italian american you know and it's changed now you know it's it's not a little bit of that
*  but not as much as it used to well when john gotty was in his heyday it was a very strange time
*  for like italian americans in new york because that whole area like when he would have those
*  block parties and and you know people there was part of the the people that would love him oh
*  yeah to this day yeah to this day absolutely you know i was gone you know i left uh for vegas in
*  79 80 so i was gone through all the madeys you know i was in vegas with those wise guys right
*  and i knew some of them we talked about it last time i was here the pesci character uh tony
*  spellacho who was always very nice to me i mean he was give me a 20 every time i saw
*  he's all right in my book uh but it's interesting like the the goddy character him as a person was
*  very strange do you know his grandson is a badass mma fighter i'm not his grandson john gotty the
*  third i think it is is a legit mma fighter he's really fucking good he's shredded the kid looks
*  like a fucking killer i mean he looks like an mma fighter covered in tattoos i think he's
*  undefeated and i think he's got the majority of his fights if not all of them are by knockout
*  well it's kind of crazy listen people love him i i never met john goddy he did a lot of good for
*  a lot of people he listen you could only judge someone by how they treat you right you know to
*  me because people go well how could you you know blah blah blah hey he was good to a lot of people
*  he was known to be a good fighter too john john was yeah he can't that's how he kind of came up
*  he was very good with his hands he was you know toe to toe and and was pretty nifty as a fighter
*  he was very public though yeah that was the thing that the old guard didn't like he became but he
*  was flashy when he became the boss he was like this guy that like made a big show of who he was
*  versus a lot of these guys like vincent the chin would act crazy and walk around a bath
*  road they want he was like al capone yeah at least he enjoyed himself these other guys uh some of
*  these other guys he enjoyed himself he was out to restaurants good look he had movie star looks at
*  least he enjoyed himself he had a nice family yeah some of these guys are holed up they have
*  millions of dollars and they live in like some shit one bedroom tenement like so i jr like uncle
*  jr he lives like this shitty life he's getting hundreds of thousands right here and there it's
*  like why you're living like that you might as well go out and enjoy it right right he yeah and they
*  still get caught even even the guys like shit they still get caught those old timers you know
*  those old timers used to just i don't know what they did with the money well they were trying to
*  avoid prosecution yeah but didn't work out almost every mobster unfortunately uh winds up dead or
*  in jail yeah yeah you know michael did you grow up around that a little bit yeah a little bit but um
*  um more uh i got out out of that area when i was in my teens really and was in the city you know
*  in the village and around actors and musicians and stuff like that was that something that it
*  always called to you being an actor no not really um i was going to go into be a doctor or something
*  like that you know i was always really good in school and and uh but uh my father was a bus
*  driver in the bronx and this and and uh he started doing community theater when i when i was
*  in high school he was like 40 just almost one day starts acting in plays which looking back knowing
*  what it takes it's very courageous you know somebody to do that and uh so i always saw
*  cool movies and even saw some theater in new york because my parents took me but then in my last
*  year high school i was like well what the hell what do you really want to do i mean if you can
*  do anything i really literally asked myself that question if you could do anything what would it be
*  and i was like i guess you know i really didn't want to stay in school for 10 years either like
*  studying i was kind of sick of that and then come out in debt come out in debt and that's the big
*  one that's a big one it's flavors the way they live their life yeah they live their life starting
*  out of the gate in their career hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt yeah and not just
*  doctors yeah even even people who don't even go to grad school sure go through yeah that's really
*  rough so you asked yourself that question and how did you come up with acting yeah i started i had
*  some good teachers in high school who like brought us to theater and and and i was reading a lot of
*  plays in high school in the library of my school and and just got into it more and more my last
*  year or two a high school i wasn't acting i didn't do any acting then and then after i said i went to
*  an acting school in new york and took a couple of classes there and then stayed for for a long time
*  actually with the couple with a teacher and met a lot of people that i still work with today back
*  then you know who were a couple of who were on the sopranos actually is live performance is that your
*  love like theater um you know it is i mean i love all of it i mean it's always about the specific
*  project and the material and the people you're with but doing it live is really special because
*  a you're doing the whole story every night from beginning to end right and you have the you're on
*  stage for whatever two hours it's that concentration and that commitment you know movies and television
*  as you know is broken up into little bits throughout the day and and um it's a different kind of
*  concentration but there is something special about being in front of an audience that's different
*  every night the reactions are different every night and there's an interplay that's very exciting
*  so do you still do it now do you go back and forth i haven't in a while i mean theater i mean i did um
*  i hope to start doing it again soon you know um at one point my wife and i built a theater and we were
*  we were producing new plays where'd you build it west 29 stream and around i think we opened in
*  2003 so when you say built the theater like what was there before i was just like a raw space i
*  think it was a it was a club at one point and then literally my wife and my father-in-law built it
*  and it looked like a theater from from like 100 years ago it was beautiful how did you get the
*  craftsmanship to like where'd you get the people to do that kind of work um my wife my father-in-law
*  they did it all themselves they did a lot means there were a couple of people they contract certain
*  things out for but a lot he was he passed away but he was a master carpenter he was just brilliant
*  and my wife's really good how many seats was it 75 seats was very intimate wow that's awesome we
*  did only new plays that had never been done and uh and we also had classes there acting what year
*  was this uh between 2003 and like 2010 so this is a real labor of love yeah it's not like you can
*  make a lot of money off of 70 no we didn't make money no it cost it actually went up cost that's
*  why we went out of business after the economy collapsed we lost a lot of our funding you know
*  we lost all the corporate funding pretty much we had a few private you know donors who really loved
*  what we were doing and i mean i built the theater basically i did a a movie kind of a not so good
*  movie for uh harvey weinstein actually oh wow and that money went and built the theater wow
*  that had to be a really interesting thing like the moment you're on stage that on this theater
*  that you built yeah and you're you're performing these plays i mean that's that had to be a dream
*  realized it had to be a pretty special moment yeah i didn't act that much there i did more directing
*  i mean we produced all the plays i did i directed a bunch of them i think i i only acted in one of
*  them but um but it was kind of the inmates running the asylum really because it was it wasn't really
*  a company but it was a company by default because there were a lot of people that go to people that
*  i you know worked with but it was yeah it was really uh rewarding my wife built all the sets
*  for all the shows as well as built the place itself so intimate 75 seats really intimate yeah
*  really intimate that's a wild decision to make to build your own theater it was her idea i i
*  wouldn't have done it probably because it as i had done i had worked in theater i started producing
*  theater my early 20s you know with a company and and um i knew what it you know it's hard it's
*  it's not a good business model right um but if you have the kind of passion and we just found a way
*  to do it she was like no we'll build it i was like um but it was really fun while it lasted
*  yeah he wanted me to do a play remember he offered me a play that's not for me no i did one i did one
*  night only what'd you do guys and dolls in carnegie hall with a bunch of tony winners and me
*  but listen if you're gonna do a fucking play guys and dolls guys and dolls i was so scared
*  remember i told you i was so fucking joe i would have fought shack instead i swear to god
*  you know my agent called i said sure i'll do it nathan lane and all the patrick wilson and
*  megan malali all these great people and me i went okay jack o'brien one of the biggest
*  broadway directors and i went okay it's a charity for uh for carnegie hall wow there you go big
*  julie look at you uh and uh so you know it's nine days rehearsal i'd never been so scared of my life
*  i tried to get out of it i said i told my agent get me out of this she said i can i said there's
*  no way and uh i did it and it was the best thing when i was done we had dress rehearsal in the
*  afternoon and then at night it was packed nine days nine days rehearsal i took the train up to
*  42nd street in the rehearsal space every day and we what you did the whole play the whole play
*  and they memorized all the lines and i remember all the fucking lines i came in off book is that
*  uh unusual that's fast we would do a 30 days that's for a drama you know that's not what
*  we did musical so you're not talking about adding choreography and all that stuff but usually he
*  30 days four weeks had an orchestra it was fantastic i mean the night i was so scared i
*  didn't tell anyone except for my wife and kids they're the only ones that came i had thought i
*  gave them that was it and afterwards it was sky high it took me a few days to come down because
*  i was so scared but then it was so great you know nathan lane there's nobody funnier than nathan
*  lane now did you want to do it again after that or was it such a i don't know i don't know fight
*  you know i don't know if it was the right material maybe you know uh you know i don't know now is
*  that a that's a rushed performance or rushed getting ready yeah it was one night only for charity
*  you know i mean if you were and that was another thing that added pressure because you know if you
*  you're doing the play you're going all right if i fuck up tuesday i'll come back wednesday
*  this was you are all in this is all or nothing if i fucked up and there was producers out the
*  guy from cats the big producer what's his name the creator of andrew loyd weber yeah he was there
*  there was all these people and actors it's like oh wow you fuck up now i would have been un-mortified
*  if i blew my line i was so scared it's not like so you blow your line you know on tv you know
*  you're filming all right fucking every you know i'll go back you know this was it yeah that's it
*  that's it 2500 people i was shitting in my pants seriously one of the most scared things ever
*  did you work have a lot of nerves when you start in stand-up yeah yeah yeah it's scary yeah when
*  you start yeah and i i came from fighting i went from fight i was in fighting i had three kick
*  boxing fights while i was doing stand-up and i think my first stand-up was was more nerve
*  racking than fighting yeah for whatever reason i don't know terrifying yeah i mean it's just also
*  like what about now people didn't no no no it's just fun i mean it'll probably be nervous for me
*  at the end of the month because i haven't done stand-up in three months like before i uh i'm
*  doing the houston improv just to fuck around um and knock the dust off i'm sure before i go on
*  stage the first time i'm like holy fuck do you even remember how to do this because it's been
*  so long you know i've never had a stretch in my career three months with no stand-up that's i've
*  taken three weeks off before and it felt weird so taking three months off is going to be very
*  strange do you combine like set material with improvisation and yeah freeform stuff yeah you
*  like there's always something going on in the audience or there's always something that happens
*  that day or something that's going on in the news you can talk about in the moment but you have to
*  have some at least i do i have to have some structure so i basically i have places where i
*  know i want to get to and then you know the rest of it is you've got to be in the you know you also
*  you have to be there you can't just be like reading the lines and like rigid with your script because
*  in the audience doesn't feel like you're having fun they don't feel like it's fun that you you're
*  you're orchestrating a dance it's not just you're putting on a stand-up routine you're also you're
*  orchestrating their evening you're having fun it's like there's a lot to the art form it's
*  it's hard to it would be hard to explain it to a computer you know you know what i mean it's like
*  there's a rhythm that you there's a thing that's happening with the audience and you gotta know
*  that makes sense just as simple as like if there was a huge storm that day and everyone went through
*  it together and you're showing up exactly something like that affects exactly you may refer to it or
*  and then there's chaos in the crowd you know i've seen brawls in the crowd all kinds of crazy
*  now but but now every now you're so well known so do they laugh when they give you a break for like
*  30 seconds the beginning you got about 30 seconds they're like oh you're here steve all right if you
*  don't deliver the fucking group we came out of our house and got a baby said we're so excited you're
*  there and then 30 seconds later like where's the fucking jokes man this is terrible and then then
*  they're mad at you and then it's worse like i've seen that happen with comics at the store where
*  like a famous guy will go on stage it doesn't really do stand up it does stand up every now
*  and then and that is the worst fucking place to do that because you're on a lineup with murderers
*  you know it's it's bill burr and crystal ea and joey diaz and al madrigal all these all these
*  killers and then some jack off from a sitcom will try to jump on stage and do 15 minutes and just
*  in the beginning they're like oh my god it's that guy from that show yeah and then 30 seconds later
*  they want to cut your fucking head off that's not a good idea just through the sitcom and stay away
*  that's not if you're going to do stand up you know you got to treat it like you're about to go do a
*  fight like you don't you want to be in shape if you're going to fight if you're going to do stand
*  up you better be in shape for it you better be prepared you better have real material that's
*  tried and proven or you know or whatever you've written you better go over that shit with a fine
*  tooth comb you better be loose you better be ready you got to be prepared start small maybe
*  to go out of town or do some open mic nights do some guest sets if you're you're a guy like but
*  there have been some people that were famous first and then they became stand-ups i think charlie
*  murphy's probably the best example that charlie was eddie's brother so he's famous for that and
*  then he did the chapelle show which was arguably the greatest sketch comedy show of all time and
*  he had these hilarious parts but the guy had never done stand-up and so here he is a huge
*  fucking star already and then he's going on stage and he's learning how to do stand-up in front of
*  this audience and i think that's incredibly difficult they're almost impossible takes balls
*  it's almost like it's like tom hanks in punch line yes all right he acted like a stand-up he
*  wasn't a great stand-up but did a good job but he was acting you ever see that movie it's a good
*  movie sally field uh tom x they acted as a stand-up they you could tell he's not a stand-up
*  yeah you see it and like it's like when someone's playing a fighter in a movie or there's a lot of
*  other things oh a baseball player you say this guy can't even fucking throw exactly like with
*  basketball you see this guy can't play exactly exactly yeah there's there's things that you can
*  see like people that smoke cigarettes will tell me that you could tell by the way a guy's holding
*  a cigarette that he doesn't really smoke absolutely they hold it too high and if in the
*  i could never you can always we talked about that on the podcast just the way they hold it
*  i could never smoke i don't smoke anymore but i did i could i've never smoked in my life
*  never a cigar i could get away with right you know i can't if i had to smoke a cigarette i don't even
*  know how i could never do it on the show i think part of the problem is they're aware that they
*  have a cigarette on them whereas the person who smokes cigarettes he just liked that cigarette
*  and they they always have a cigarette in their hand so it's just a normal part of being who they
*  are whereas if you don't you're like i got a cigarette in my hand everything you're doing
*  like there's a cigarette in my hand i'm gonna smoke a cigarette now it's like but you can tell
*  you can absolutely tell yeah you can tell you can tell you say this guy's not a smoker man yeah yeah
*  you know i'm sure guitar players feel like that when you watch a guy playing a guitar player in
*  a movie you know i don't know how to play guitar so i can't get i don't understand if he's doing it
*  right or wrong but i would imagine that would be infuriating a lot of stuff but listen i used to
*  watch the shows in vegas movies like from vegas or tv shows and in in the first two minutes you
*  know this this movie sucks this sucks that'll never happen the deal is rooting for you right yes come
*  on you know yeah that this will never happen just like in new york a woody allen movie some woody
*  allen movies are like fantasy the beautiful block with the trees and yeah you know it's like you
*  know if you're from that place or you're a comic you know immediately say that would never happen
*  yeah yeah i guess in gangster movies too you see a lot of bad there's a lot of bad ones oh yeah
*  yeah what's an example of an obviously bad one oh jesus i don't even know there's so many
*  fucking bad ones where you go this is just ridiculous this is just you know i did one
*  kill the irishman which i didn't like there's some really good actors in it but there's so
*  many things that are off it was a period piece the hand moves i enjoyed that movie did you like it a
*  lot of people like it i didn't like it i i liked it uh the first cut i hated i remember went to a
*  screening i i told my wife fucking hated it and it got better and as years gone on people
*  we shot it in detroit it was supposed to be in cleveland you know just little shit maybe if you're
*  just a viewer you wouldn't notice but i did but there's so many bad uh bad i heard the
*  travolta playing gaudi was a bad one i heard that was hilarious you know it was so bad i didn't see
*  it but i heard it yeah i didn't think travolta was so bad i thought a lot of the other things
*  were bad and they were i think it was in uh they shot some of it in cincinnati so that means the
*  extras are from cincinnati you know what i mean right right right yeah yeah you know but there's
*  there's a ton of them you know people love that genre you know people love the the mob genre like
*  the westerns or horror films it's the same thing particularly after the sopranos the sopranos fucking
*  exactly kick started that it really that that genre became far more popular they tried they i
*  think mob city was a tv show and uh you know there's been so many of them and you know you
*  got the the nail on the head the gangster in a can kind of guy you go this guy you know and
*  then you got some different stuff you say this guy doesn't scam me for two seconds right you know
*  what's crazy for me was uh going back and watching the original episode sopranos where it read like
*  a comedy oh yeah very different show very different show when edie falco has the um the the gun and
*  she's outside and uh who was was her daughter's climbing back into the window yeah but i'm like
*  this is like a comedy it's like it was a different show like edie falco's character evolved and
*  became this very complex woman who was battling with this reality that she's living with this guy
*  who's you know a fucking murderer and a mob boss and she's enjoying the perks of that it became
*  like this very interesting character but in the beginning it wasn't like that at the beginning
*  the first episode was kind of funny yeah when i first when i auditioned and read the script i
*  wasn't sure if it was a full-on spoof of the mob i really wasn't sure there was some you know there
*  was a murder scene that my character does and there was some dramatic stuff there's a lot of
*  humor in it yeah and it was around the time i think analyze this so there was the mob spoof
*  and i'm i wasn't sure i couldn't say that you know from just reading that pilot episode it was hard
*  to tell but i really liked the cast they were putting together and that that was the thing that
*  really sold me on it like i knew some of them like edie and tony serico and uh finney pastore i knew
*  jim's work but i didn't know him personally i'd seen him in a play so i was like this is a good
*  cast so yeah um but it was very hard to tell from that from that pilot script what happened
*  that it evolved and it became what i think it was always that was always the plan um you know like
*  anything you start to see what you have like what are these actors bringing you know what are they
*  playing to their strengths and what kind of qualities they're bringing to it um you know
*  just like there's that one scene in the pilot where at the end towards the end of the pilot night my
*  character tells tony soprano oh i could go to hollywood and sell my story or something
*  and he in the script it was kind of he was like fatherly like you don't want to do that and sell
*  out you got to stay with us and build a family or whatever and instead jim just grabs me you know by
*  the throat or something like that it became very menacing and very intimidating and he really you
*  know and i think david saw that was like oh wow that's the guy that's the character and and
*  it probably influenced how he took the story and how he would write it but i think a lot i think a
*  lot of the tone was already in his head but seeing what the actors were bringing to it i think
*  you know influenced a lot gandolfini was so fucking believable i mean you know there's when you when
*  you see think about a guy who just embodied a role like when he was tony soprano oh and he's not and
*  he wasn't like that that's the other thing he was more like a hippie you know he was very laid back
*  you know he wore like burkin stocks and like a bandana on his head and big music guy he didn't
*  really talk like that he was uh yeah i wipe my ass with your face hey big music guy you know yeah he
*  was he never wanted to do a talk show you know joe i i would say why don't you everyone thinks you're
*  tony soprano why don't you pick whether it be let them in or or whatever and show them the real jim
*  you're a very intelligent guy i mean he's not that guy at all matter of fact he would say to me
*  like before the season uh let's go down and have dinner at ill cortile which i ran into you there
*  one time let's go down to moray street i want to start getting back into the swing of things
*  because he wasn't he didn't hang around with those guys he wasn't that guy at all but he didn't he
*  never did a talk show he did 60 minutes he wouldn't do uh any of the talk shows he said i'm not
*  interesting he wasn't doing and he didn't grow up around that he grew up in jersey went to rutgers
*  university he was you know an actor theater guy i tell you what's funny uh you know i i wrote a
*  kid's book called nicky deuce and it turned it into a movie and michael's in it and pauli walnuts and
*  johnny sack and i was in jim's trailer and uh he had just did the movie with brad pitt a mob movie
*  and uh he said harvey weinstein called he wants me to do letterman i said i don't do talk shows and
*  uh and he gets calling and he says he got fucking nasty with jim and jim said i will beat the fuck
*  out of harvey weinstein he fucking calls me again i will beat the fuck out of him for the money he
*  paid me i'm not fucking doing it swear to god and this is all before the harvey weinstein shit when
*  he was still the king shit this is 2012 you know when you see that academy awards speech thank you
*  compilation where all the people go up all the various people that eventually talk shit about
*  him go up and praise harvey weinstein i never saw it oh my god it's so bizarre it's so strange
*  because they were intimidated yeah he had that much power over people's careers and they didn't
*  feel like their voice would be heard or that people would you know take them seriously he would not
*  find a way to to fuck you basically you know fuck you up he would know me he would know me uh
*  every three or four times like i run into him in madison square garden and there's a restaurant
*  trebek a grill which he had owned a piece of at one point and give you a half ass hello maybe he
*  was way above i was beneath him yeah he never got punched in the face is that what it is i heard
*  jason priestly punched him in the face though jason had a party yeah yeah i heard that he got
*  out of line and jason priestly punched him in the face i think nobody beat the shit out of harvey
*  weinstein and it wouldn't be that difficult he could fucking holly breathe he's smoking chain
*  smoking he wasn't a tough guy he was tough with assistance you know but he's us like when if you
*  thought about a character in a film harvey weinstein is almost two on the head almost unbelievable
*  nobody would nobody would do that he would never get away with too much too much
*  how many years is he so long going doing 20 something years nobody would do that 20 something
*  years yeah and might be more right they got well there's way more cases yeah there's way more
*  cases this is just what he's been convicted for right i mean he apparently was behaving like that
*  for decades so you're telling me nobody knew they knew they all knew that's what's crazy is it's
*  worked into his fucking contract his contract had if you get this amount this amount of sex
*  like per sexual harassment case they had it that he would have to pay this much if it was two he'd
*  have to pay that much if it was three hit imagine if you're signing up for a place like steve i know
*  you're a piece of shit so this is what we're going to work into the contract all your piece of shit
*  behavior we're going to write it down and you're going to be penalized per piece of shit behavior
*  oh yeah it's amazing it's funny you know what they're all complicit this is something that i
*  don't understand these assistants people in his office people that knew this stuff that saw this
*  stuff that set him up that he was meeting the girl in the lobby but then she comes down and says oh
*  harvey needs to meet you up in his room she was part of it or he or whatever the assistants were
*  it was like i mean i would never do that i think you play dumb yeah i would never be privy to that
*  no of course not but you also you don't have to and when you think of an assistant in particular
*  you're thinking about someone who has virtually no power and there's a thing called diffusion of
*  responsibility where there's too many people involved you don't feel like you're responsible
*  you don't feel like you you know that's when they say it's easier to assault someone in front of a
*  hundred people than it is to assault someone in front of one person because one person might step
*  in and stop it but a hundred people will sit around and go someone's got to stop this got you
*  you know and that's i think that when you're an assistant you're probably you're working check to
*  check you got this guy who's the king of hollywood he's a fucking he's worth hundreds of millions of
*  dollars intimidating yes and he's a big i understand angry guy yells at people he yells that's what he
*  did you know what's amazing to me is people still haven't come forward people that worked with him
*  uh actors whatever actresses i think they're still afraid somehow he's going to come back like in a
*  horror film keeps on he's dead he's not dead some people don't he's not they don't want to deal with
*  that publicly you know it's a hard thing to talk about right they don't want to they don't want
*  everybody to know i think you're right and i think also i don't mean people that he assaulted just
*  people that were around him that were aware i don't know who that is i just think they don't
*  want to talk about it publicly i think you're right about that i think it's they've already
*  he's already been caught it's over they got him he's in jail he'd be in jail forever he's fucked
*  up his body's falling apart he can't even walk i mean is what a fall from what a fall from grace
*  spectacular fall in just a few years i mean if you go back seven years ago there's not a whisper
*  of this right so seven years later the guy's in jail can't walk you know his body's falling apart
*  that's where he just got to get somebody to give him the cyanide pill and fuck it should have done
*  that if you look he had to know where this was going when he was free you should have just
*  fucking i don't think he did know i think he thought he was going to get off and he was
*  planning a comeback and you know he was that you know i know one of his attorneys uh that was there
*  early on and he fired him and i ran into him right before he got sentenced a few weeks before and i
*  said this fucking harvey's gonna get off and he said no no no you see he won't get off if he would
*  have kept me he said he said really if he would have kept me i would have got him off he said how
*  would he have gotten him off i didn't go you know i mean i know the guy acquaintance from the nick
*  games and sure enough he got what 23 years it seems like things happen in the court of public
*  opinion on guys like that well it certainly did here i would have just there's no way i would
*  want to be what kind of life is that he's such a character i mean just with his disgusting face
*  and his body and like everything about it yeah you had some dealings with him yeah i did a couple
*  of jobs with him i did it i wrote a script for him i had to work with him kind of closely on
*  did he try to grab you no try to grab me what was he like you know he was okay with me you know he
*  had opinions um uh he was all right i mean it was just work there was nothing i mean obviously he
*  didn't go to dinner with him about that no no it was only in his office and stuff i did and i did
*  a job for his brother another job for his brother i think his brother was a nicer guy right he's
*  okay i think he was very intimidated by harvey i think harvey was a bully to his brother big time
*  it's such a fascinating story because it's incredible and he had the wife and the two kids
*  and a beautiful wife it's crazy it's like how the fuck does that even happen beautiful wife and it's
*  one of those things that if it's if it's in a film it just it's almost like he's too much of a villain
*  that would never happen all the details when you put it all together you're like no really in
*  hollywood where he's famous and then he's dealing with the most famous people in the world right
*  and everybody keeps their mouth shut and he fucks a-list stars and then puts them in films like
*  do you think uh uh do you think that some of the the women that have denied having sex with him
*  had sex with him yes you do yes yeah yeah i wondered about i would have probably i don't know
*  i don't know you would have fucked him no i wouldn't have talked about it if i did yeah exactly
*  i don't know yeah do you want to talk about that that's hard shit to talk about i understand but
*  but the thing about harvey wine scene and people like that they would have had if if he would have
*  said listen i'm a fat disgusting bastard but if you bang me i'll put you in the next movie
*  they would line up there would be people lined up around the corner i think that is party part of
*  what he did no no i think i i i don't know if that's true you know i think from what i understand
*  i don't think he needed to do this i think it's his ego and i think that's too like bill cosby
*  was the same thing yes yes it becomes a pathology and i think there's also a thing about power
*  you know it's a it's a power thing to have power over people sure and also to have power over these
*  beautiful actresses that everybody else was lusting over you know you put some actress in
*  a film and you know she's the center of everyone's attention she's got a you know a small dress on
*  she walks into a room and the you know the the whole place lights up and she's sucking harvey's
*  dick you know that it's the power thing yeah because he could have had tons of that's a shame
*  he could have had a ton of women a ton of women you know i think it's an addiction thing too yes
*  i think if you you know there's there was a recording of this one girl that he had groped
*  and then you know she wanted a movie role and he's grabbing her and he's like just come back to my
*  place come on come on just come on like you're hearing it like a guy asking for heroin yeah yeah
*  and he was almost sniveling like begging her yeah it was weird like he'd go from being really
*  intimidating to almost begging like pity me i need you please don't don't embarrass me you know right
*  it was very weird yeah i think it's an addiction thing i think there was so much going on with that
*  guy i mean he had two young i don't know if they're daughters you have two young daughters
*  i think he has older kids younger kids he had his wife and they were just gone yeah right maybe
*  unless he just said that's a rough unless he just said i'm going away i mean i don't know if they
*  visit them or what the whole thing jesus christ it's all crazy it's a it's a it's a shakespeareian
*  story epic epic proportions horror story for everyone involved the horror story the casting
*  couch in hollywood if you stop and think about it right you've got all these women they want to be
*  in films they want to be stars then you got these guys that can actually help them make them stars
*  but they want something and then you set up this dynamic that's existed since you know the fucking
*  20s imagine what it was like back then oh my god well you know the fatty arbuckle story yeah did
*  you read the book i fatty that jerry stahl wrote no it's fantastic yeah it's kind of almost like a
*  fake memoir written from his point of view it's brilliant well as he was like he was the biggest
*  star of his day yes world right known all over the world yeah i mean he was basically like
*  he was a comedy star a huge star and he did something with a woman where he stuck like a
*  bottle up her vagina well that that this goes into it apparently there's theories that he didn't really
*  do that that it was set up because that that guy was jealous of him like a studio guy yeah it goes
*  into that it's a really good book i was jerry stahl who wrote permanent midnight you know he did
*  oh okay yeah that's a great book is there real evidence that points to the fact there is set up
*  i think there is yeah and that was the end of his career oh yeah done done done yeah it was the girl died oh
*  yeah that's awful yeah there's different theories that he was set up by somebody and that he
*  that he that all that was just they holy shit yeah imagine that that's crazy well i could tell you the
*  world is a better place with harvey weinstein off the streets well he does honestly what he did to
*  what he did to all these actresses and women and assistants even just horrible and not sexually
*  but he destroyed guys too you know and directors and just a horrible human and and jesus well he
*  was getting away with it right for the longest time for the longest behavior that was reinforced
*  by the people around him and then he got away with it what's also interesting is like if you help
*  someone murder somebody you would get an accessory you you you would get you would get prison time
*  you would there would be charges but there's no charges against any of the people that absolutely
*  knew what he was doing but that's what i'm saying i have two daughters aiding and abetting there's
*  no it doesn't apply to that joe i got two daughters in their 20s i don't think my daughters in a
*  million years no matter how much they wanted to be in the business would be an accomplice to that
*  and tell the girl and say well harvey's gonna be up in the room or whatever it's crazy things go get
*  harvey's medicine to fucking shoot in his dick or something yeah yeah come on do you know what he
*  had this is i was going this text thread with a bunch of comics he had a type of gangrene that
*  you get from diabetes a bacterial infection on his dick and his dick was horribly malformed so i had
*  this we were talking about this and then i googled it and then i said to my friends do not google
*  this and then they're like why not so i send them a photo of it horrible of what it looks like oh
*  my god it's like your your genitals just rot away like all the skin around it rotted away and that
*  was one of the things that one of the actresses had said is that she thought that he was maybe
*  intersex or transgender or that he had a vagina because he was so scarred up oh my god so it's
*  like it's it's again it's almost too on the head it's like as a as a movie character he's almost
*  too disgusting well what do you see playing him in this movie hmm it'd be a good question who
*  could pull it off christian bale i hope they don't make the movie how's that i don't want to see that
*  movie if nothing else lifetime they're gonna make the movie they'll do it a lifetime yeah who
*  hot i was gonna say this what do you there's all this talk about cgi acting and that they're gonna
*  be able to create cgi characters that act in films i mean i was just saying really boring i think i
*  agree with you but i mean maybe you'd have a cgi harvey weinstein just actually no one has to play
*  him you know it's like no one wants to play hitler now you know it's like it's too much you don't
*  want to be the guy oh that's that guy who played hitler you know what i mean so like playing harvey
*  weinstein yeah that would be i think at some point there'll be a movie yeah i hope i think so
*  the only thing that would hold it back would be hollywood saying you know like this is probably
*  not good for us yeah yeah it's opening an independent film yeah and you would have to i mean
*  if someone really wanted to thoroughly research it and like in really find out what actually
*  happened it would take a long time well those two girls did yeah uh that wrote the book there's a
*  book out there i think they were writers for the new york times of him or the new yorker
*  there is a good book out about two they they really researched uh does it go into detail about
*  the speculation of which actresses actually i didn't read it i mean i don't know for sure
*  but i think at some point you know what didn't they not want to make the belushi movie years ago
*  remember that who did who played michael chiclis michael chiclis really once again but that's a
*  very different after the case defending the cave very different story very different yeah very
*  different but wait a minute but they didn't want to make that at the time that was a big thing that
*  actors didn't want drugs and yeah they didn't you know they were trying to protect them i guess and
*  and hollywood kind of fed that be so-so and but he died and he was beloved it was yes
*  absolutely wired this is it oh there it is you know is that supposed to be jeremy pippen
*  look at him there wow he is so young yeah wow how old was and they didn't want to make that movie
*  and a lot of actors didn't want to be in it wow because of that reason you know interesting
*  i never saw this they thought it might have damaged careers do you remember that i don't
*  i'm old it was a long time yeah big difference i'm old the cgi thing is weird right like i think
*  they're gonna do that i think they're gonna have cgi movies where the i think they're gonna do it
*  you know they've tried to do it before with like that tom hanks animated film you remember that
*  film no it's like a christmas movie he's on a fucking train it's like an anime do you remember
*  that jamy uh something express yeah something express they won't want to at least they won't
*  want a bigger trailer the producers will like it right the producers will love it the person
*  will love it well they'll love it because they can completely i don't have to listen to this
*  the artists yeah yeah fucking whiny actor yeah yeah there it is the polar express express it was
*  very strange but it wasn't realistic it was it's like it was that uncanny valley between you know
*  realistic actual people and animation it was some strange sort of but you get the feeling that as
*  time goes on they're going to get better and better at this and then one day they're going to be able
*  to nail it right they'll get like marlon brando to do a movie right stuff like that like they do it
*  came to coachella and they had the hologram yeah and that king kohl and his daughter remember
*  they sang the thing oh yeah sanatris coming back a new hit or eternity god that's so strange
*  does that shit drive you crazy kind of yeah hey i'll be i'll be retired i've done screen screen
*  stuff and i find it really boring and tedious green screen stuff yeah no i haven't done like
*  that animated version thing but green screen is well yeah given your sensibilities if something
*  came up like that for you like a jurassic park type movie or something like that would you even
*  be interested in that i don't know it depends where i'm at at the time right you know if i was broken
*  sometimes you have to factor those things in right um no i mean the the most fun thing is when you're
*  you know dealing with other actors and going eye to eye and playing off each other that to me at
*  least not not everyone's like that a lot of people like doing action and all that stuff i don't really
*  care for that stuff so much you know yeah i like more the you know well that's the best part of
*  the business the the actual work you know of course i don't like show business i don't know
*  if you do i don't i like the actual these days like even on blue bloods i'm working and i work
*  a lot with bridger mornan or donnie walberg or you go and this is why i became an actor this was
*  yeah a lot of fun they respect each other the material is really good the scene goes what do
*  you mean by you don't like show business what do you mean i'm not a the whole bullshit agents managers
*  opening nights i mean yeah it's not for me i went to the emmy's four times the sag awards i wanted
*  to stick fucking needles in my eyes yeah i mean it's just not me i just i like real people most
*  of my friends are friends that i've had my whole life you know michael's one of my closest friends
*  but you know what i mean i mean i'm not a showbiz guy there's some guys who showbiz guys they love
*  it they love going in and pitching i love it i love this i love that the whole world the whole
*  scene i don't you know i like the work that's it yeah you know i was kind of in show business even
*  at the riviera by default i don't know somehow i i went from a bouncer to book an axe and
*  you know i don't dislike them i just not a showbiz it's a funny path it's a funny your path is very
*  funny strange yeah yeah i tell them like an italian forest gump it's such a weird world
*  you've you just sort of stepped into it kind of yeah and listen i've worked very hard and i love
*  the work i mean i you know but that part i don't like yeah there's some people love it they were
*  always there opening night you know and and at premieres and listen i'm there if i am
*  supporting someone a friend of mine or something like that i don't go just to go on the red carpet
*  take pictures and the fuck do i care you know i mean i don't that's not my thing yeah yeah no i
*  don't like it either i don't think you like that kind of stuff no like you're doing what you do
*  yeah that's why i like doing this it's like it's outside of it yeah that's cool yeah i mean you know
*  like i said the work on the sopranos on other shows on movies go man this that was fucking great
*  i had a great day you know yeah not you know not even if it's high profile like we did the movie
*  that was great you know every day was a great day but now how do they are they resuming filming now
*  for things like this the the governor of california said i think this week they're
*  allowing some productions to open up again not in new york i'm here in may august maybe early
*  september what's interesting is because of the protests the covid cases have ramped up and no
*  one's saying that it's hilarious they're like i don't know what happened they're all playing
*  dumb on tv because no one wants to blame it on the protests or connect it in some way to the movement
*  because then you'll be labeled a racist or something yeah so they're not even saying
*  anything so the people that we're relying on for the news are playing dumb as to why
*  hundreds of thousands of people marching together face to face screaming how that ramps up i guess
*  we're gonna know in about two or three weeks we already know we already know but the mayor of
*  new york de blasio said the people either getting tested or whatever don't ask them if they were
*  protesters yes yeah that's that's part of it yeah when they're doing contact tracing they they are
*  not allowed to ask if you were a part of protest which is hilarious the world is upside down i want
*  out how strange i want off does it bounce back stop the world it'll bounce back you think it'll be
*  different but i think it's gonna take a long long time does it do we ever get to a place of logic
*  do you ever get to a balanced place because it seems like this woke ideology that's permeated
*  politics now it's it went from being a thing that only existed in universities to it was existing
*  in like tech startups and it was starting to get into media and it was working its way to journalism
*  and now it's fucking everywhere but often things have to go really far before they can find a balance
*  into society like a lot of the move the protest movement which i find hopeful is a lot of young
*  people yes very diverse crowd who are just saying we want we don't want this right world we're
*  inherited with racism and yes institution you know systemic racism and stuff and that gives me a lot
*  of hope the protest gives you a protest you know when parkland happened and there was this big
*  movement of young people who's saying we're scared to go to school we want something done that was
*  you know these kids who are saying hey we want something different and as they get older you know
*  i think it'll be integrated into society in ways that you know will work i hope i have to have hope
*  otherwise it's just too uh you know i i have a lot of hope in the young generation i really do
*  well i i have hope in humans and i think that if you look at the the history of humans if you go
*  back 200 years the way people behaved and you compare it to today there's a vast improvement
*  in almost every area 100 and i think this is a big blip on the radar this is a big moment in time
*  and i think we'll come out of that on the other end a better species i agree but along the way
*  there's going to be a lot of devastation like the fucking looting and the rioting and this stupid
*  shit with de Blasio not asking if people have been protesters to find out what effect this this thing
*  has had where you you do get people that are in the middle of a pandemic and you get them on top
*  of each other's breathing in each other's spit and that's what's happening world is insane it's
*  fucking insane it's gone crazy man it has and there's nowhere to go like you can't say well i'm just
*  gonna pack up and yeah well well what's really crazy is it's all overseas too i've been looking
*  at these london riots like they're having riots now in london so like and in france like what the
*  fuck happened that this shit made it all the way across the ocean yeah it's so strange it's like
*  how did you guys start fighting like what are you rioting for what are you doing yeah you know i
*  mean well they're protesting too they're probing those deals there are also people who just you
*  know have conscience about this and yes i'm on change there's there is there is the you know the
*  extreme you know people who are and some people who are not protesting who are just causing
*  in some ways it's very it's hopeful because it shows you that the united states still
*  radically affects the world culturally that's true when there is something that's happening over here
*  the rest of the world sort of takes notice the united states like it or not does take the lead
*  culturally oh yeah yes they do yeah i mean and then with films that's a huge part of it i mean
*  tv too tv and films i mean you stop and think i mean there's been some great films and movies
*  and and television shows have come out of england and the uk and other parts of the world but
*  overwhelmingly the art form emanates from here oh yeah we take the lead yeah and then with stand-up
*  that's i mean this is where it started stand-up started the united states and the difference
*  between the stand-up here the level stand-up here versus the level everywhere else totally
*  incomparable now have you done stand-up in uh hey other countries yeah go ahead yeah yeah yeah i
*  get it man four bottles of water i don't know how you still have you done yeah yeah i've done stand-up
*  in australia i love doing in australia i've done stand-up in england i've done stand-up in ireland
*  yeah also and and audiences what do you find they're great they're great smarter dumber
*  attentive very attentive very attentive yeah like i took my friend tony to stockholm
*  sweden and he was like uh he goes dude i felt like i bombed i go no they laughed they just laugh and
*  then they listen it's different you get a different vibe like they laugh you you just have to and then
*  the second show he goes i got it now he goes it just felt so different he goes just felt like
*  there's no they didn't roll with you i go you also have to remember english is their second language
*  so when they're listening to you there's you know they have to kind of translate it
*  and they're laughing but also cultural context is very different like they get our culture they
*  get the context but it's not as front and center as it is if you're doing a show in columbus ohio
*  or something like that now wasn't it like in the 90s i think it was in the 90s where comics were
*  going to england u.s comics didn't like the audiences here anymore hicks right yeah hicks
*  rich hall yep yeah some other comics it was a ventriloquist david something they went to
*  australia and england right yes well they're very england has fantastic audiences and they're really
*  attentive they really listen well and they do their stand up very differently their stand up
*  over there is like thematic like they'll do like uh they'll do they have a theme you know and they'll
*  carry that theme through their whole stand up it's very different but you know there's been
*  comic like ricky gervais is a great example that have done very well he's got a great show
*  show on netflix oh yeah he's created everything he's great he's funny funny funny yeah and i i
*  loved when he was hosting the golden gloves love that he was great yeah i mean just tells him shut
*  the fuck up yeah there's so much virtue this latest thing all these actors have this black and white
*  video talking about racism i take responsibility that one what are you doing you know what i was
*  saying to my friend i go you know what that is these motherfuckers haven't gotten any attention
*  exactly for months because they haven't been filmed jumping on it well you talked about it with the
*  the song imagine at the beginning right yes you fucking morons they got the blowback from that
*  well they got blowback from this too everything they try to do that virtue signals like you know
*  we're gonna take a stand this is no longer gonna happen it's not good like nobody thought it was
*  good yeah like this is not what this is what this is is a fucking horrible cop it's a really bad guy
*  who killed somebody it's not like these actors are out there being racist and holding people back
*  and trying that's not what you're doing like what are you you're taking responsibility no you're
*  trying to get attention that's what you're doing this stupid fucking thing you're doing i wish they
*  they ever feel like doing that again call me call me i'll tell you how it's gonna turn out every one
*  of these dumb things you're gonna do i'll tell you how it's gonna come out if you're gonna have
*  one actor and then the next you're gonna cut to each one of them i take responsibility not you do
*  you take attention you're sucking it up like a sponge shut the fuck up and wait you're a week
*  away from filming again but that that's also we've talked about there's people that do stuff
*  you know for the money right and then there's some that the money's irrelevant they need to be
*  told how great they are and pat on the back and they that's what they need and then there's some
*  of them that are so wrapped up in this liberal and progressive ideology that they literally can't see
*  how dumb this looks to the rest of the world they think they're going to do a good thing and they
*  think that through their celebrity they're going to use their platform and their voice and they're
*  going to make a difference if you really think that as a professional actor you're going to make a
*  fucking difference with racism and crime and violence and police brutality you should stop
*  acting because you should go to a fucking doctor and get your head checked i agree something wrong
*  with just shut up and act shut up and act that's what we like opinions of something you can express
*  your opinions that's cool and people you know you want to know but don't preach but that that video
*  was a little bit cringy sanctimonious and very you know yeah i got it from a bunch i don't even know
*  what it means i'll be honest with you it means i want attention yeah it means i want attention
*  and get ready to cringe get ready to clench your butthole shut and go oh no no what are you doing
*  what do you do that was that was kind of do you guys know who kyle dunnigan is no kyle dunnigan
*  i know he's a comic yeah hilarious comic who does a lot of these face swap videos and uh he he he
*  he does caitlyn jenner like fucking it's one of the his instagram page is the funniest fucking
*  instagram page on the planet earth by far but he's got this new one that he did where he go to it
*  jamie go to kyle dunnigan's instagram page you guys see this where he has these characters that
*  he does with the face swap and he shoves them into that video so you get and it's just that i
*  cringe it lampoons yeah wait wait till you see this because this is the perfect antidote for that
*  cringe here we go jamie uh will cue this up here jamie the guy is a goddamn genius i take
*  responsibility i don't see it jamie did you see this steve i take responsibility
*  i'm on the fence about it i take responsibility for every unchecked moment for every time i sit
*  give me five on the light hand side i'll take responsibility for not listening to magin and
*  leaving me knickers on the floor they're called underpants i will no longer allow an unchecked
*  moment i will no longer throw away the african-american part of the oil cookie just to get to the creamy
*  white middle i will hire more black hookers going for a job should not be a death sentence
*  sleeping in your own home should not be a death sentence uh sorry i guess i don't know we are no
*  longer bystanders well who the hell's that broad racist murderous cops need need what the only time
*  is going to stop when you start truly holding the perpetrators uh uh to account start putting them
*  in jail you're welcome racist rest in peace that's funny that's that's good that's good but that's
*  nothing compared to some of his other shit go to his page if you need to look at that
*  but have you seen the real one yeah you saw it he does ones with the cardiansians where he has
*  caitlyn jenner talking to the cardassians but the cardassians don't really talk they just make
*  noises like me me me me baby baby no you're fucking idiot that's not what i said like it's
*  it's it's genius it's genius yeah this is what it is i mean everybody and i like a lot of those
*  people that are in that video unfortunately i think they're great i just think somebody should talk
*  to them somebody outside the business just grab them by the shoulders publishers and they're not
*  seeing people they're not getting feedback that's what it is yeah they need feedback
*  someone needs to grab and go listen to me don't don't do this don't do this don't do this the
*  publishers well the problem is also if someone comes up to them and tells them are you willing
*  to take a stand against racism and they're like no you can't say no so you just wind up doing it
*  because you don't want anybody to think you're a racist so you just kind of hop on board they got
*  they did get big blow back that and of course the song the song got the bigger blowback because
*  that was ridiculous she was all smiling and beautiful imagine there's no heaven and big
*  mansions and yeah and what was that about that was about the pandemic yeah but in the meantime
*  what does imagine have to do with the pandemic exactly the song has nothing to do with the
*  pandemic it was gal gado's idea she was apparently calling up all these celebrities asking for them
*  to join in in song and they're gonna heal everybody through love and and music you know
*  people are there big mansions and the guy can't pay us no heaven but meanwhile what a terrible
*  song to sing when people are dying imagine there's no heaven imagine grandma's just rotting
*  but also that song has nothing to do doesn't parallel the pandemic yeah i mean and you know
*  and especially at the time in new york i mean we've had three or four people that we know that died
*  you know and numerous people that got sick and they were those refrigeration trucks i mean they
*  were everywhere man and the ambulances were going i mean you know things have calmed down but it was
*  fucking horrible 800 people a day in new york at one point which is crazy to imagine i mean think
*  about nine of your theaters right it was it was horrible and then like i said every day you knew
*  people you know i mean there's you know a guy owned a diner a couple diners i've known the guy
*  for 20 years a photographer from the garden a good guy he died another friend of mine yeah i mean
*  they died and and numerous people got it yeah so it's it's a real thing i mean some places there
*  wasn't many cases so i could understand like in a way you're seeing it on tv yeah but it's not here
*  but in new york and people are holed up they can't pay their rent they can't pay their bills they
*  they can't eat luckily they got you know stimulus and unemployment eventually at the beginning no
*  you know and you got some celebrities ellen saying it's like being in jail she lives in the biggest
*  house in the world yeah on the beach yeah it couldn't be any better where she's living the
*  thing about ellen was she got a little blowback she got a lot of blowback but that was a funny
*  joke she said i'm in the same clothes every day and everyone's gay it's like being in jail that's
*  funny is that what the joke was that's what the joke was okay it wasn't she wasn't saying i'm in
*  jail over here in my mansion then i got her she was yeah it was what she said was fucking funny
*  you know she was like uh this uh pandemic is like being in jail i'm in the same clothes every day
*  and everyone's gay i mean that's funny that's funny because she lives she's gay she lives with
*  a gay woman i mean it's like that's a funny joke it was a good job my mistake people were mad at
*  her i'm like oh come on i took it out of context yes yeah well they didn't care it's also when
*  people are broke and people can't literally they're not just broke there's no hope in sight and it's
*  no fault of their own it's a very bad situation terrible they don't want to hear any fucking
*  jokes from some really rich lady who lives on the beach talking about how this is like prison i mean
*  honestly and listen i i'm very compassionate i mean these people lost their jobs and they
*  they didn't have extra money or maybe they're divorced and child support and i mean this is
*  real shit a lot of there was no way to make money right that's even as as much as a guy wanted to go
*  to work or whatever there was no work to be right no work to be had everything shut down
*  yeah it's it's a mess yeah and then you take into account how alcohol like sales was an
*  essential business liquor stores is an essential business but alcoholics anonymous was banned
*  yeah it's crazy you couldn't go to meetings so there's these people that are just like in despair
*  and then they can't go to alcoholics anonymous meetings and they can't work and then you know
*  there's a lot of fucking a lot of bad things i i sunday was the first time i had a drink in
*  three months since this thing started i didn't have one drink i just i was depressed i knew if i
*  i get a drink and watch tv all night i mean i i just had my first drink on on saturday what did
*  you spend the time doing during the pandemic you know uh we start i would walk just about every
*  day and really nothing i mean i'm not a big tv guy i was reading doing the podcast watching some tv
*  doing the podcast preparing that doing press you know uh radio and and zoom and shit like that
*  kind of kept us sane we were doing two a week then we went down to one i had my wife with me
*  and my daughter we cooked every night and i didn't see my uh older daughter for over a month and a
*  half she just lives in the village i didn't even see her wow i mean you couldn't even see her you
*  know i mean plus i don't want to get sick i'm overweight i mean i'm not i'm not a smoker or
*  nothing and uh you know my wife's a marathon runner but we you know we're older i don't get
*  fucking sick and so we were careful i'm still careful here but uh listen it's a terrible thing
*  man you know and it's not over no it's kicking back in that's what's crazy because of the protests
*  and because of a lot of the states have lifted up their social distancing and they're all they're
*  you know required and then people are acting like there's nothing happening so they're going to bars
*  and they're drinking and people are tired of it yeah they're tired of it and want and feel like oh
*  if it's open it's open let's go and exactly i understand that but the thing is it hasn't gone
*  away i mean and i i don't know what the fucking answer is i understand everyone's tired of it but
*  listen down in orange county the beaches are packed packed well the good news is vitamin d
*  is one of the most important factors in keeping a healthy immune system and one of the things that
*  they found out was that 80 plus percent of the people that are in the icu with covid have a
*  vitamin d deficiency four percent have sufficient levels of vitamin d it's a huge factor because
*  vitamin d is not just a fight i had a lady dr ronda patrick she's been on my podcast several times
*  she went into this whole i brought her on to talk about how to strengthen your immune system
*  during this time and she said one of the big most important factors is vitamin d it's a huge factor
*  it's one of the reasons why people on the east coast they get that seasonal depression they're
*  not going out in the winter and they're not they're not supplementing with vitamin d
*  70 of america is vitamin defeat vitamin d deficient 70 has insufficient and that's in the
*  sun vitamin d yes you get it from the sun that's the best way to get it for sure is to get in the

*  depressed as fucking hell there were some nights you know i can't sleep at night so i go to bed at
*  two o'clock two thirty in the morning i mean some nights just i mean i'm i'm up alone it's
*  fucking horrible but there's a logic to the the the reason why they had uh alcohol being an essential
*  business is there's logic to it and that is there's a lot of people that are alcoholics
*  and if you make them quit cold turkey and they can't buy any booze you're going to take beds up
*  that would be better suited for people that have covid so the idea is just like let these people
*  have their alcohol they just didn't think it was going to last as long as it did they thought this
*  was going to be a couple of weeks of lockdown and then we'd get back to business but obviously

*  opposed to being holed up and i got a pretty good size apartment but
*  it's not the same yeah going down the elevator and the shit you know and here it's sunny every day
