# Joe Rogan Experience #1896 - Bjorn Lomborg
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5.8s)]
*  Would you like coffee? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9.8s)]
*  So, see, I brought my Mountain Dew diet. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=13.8s)]
*  Oh boy, I like a man who prepares for his podcasts. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=16.8s)]
*  Alright, we rolling? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=20.8s)]
*  We're up? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=21.8s)]
*  Did you get that part? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=22.8s)]
*  This dude drinks Mountain Dew diet. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=23.8s)]
*  That is like the anti-environmentalist beverage of choice. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=26.0s)]
*  Is it? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=28.6s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=29.6s)]
*  Aluminum is actually good, right? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=30.6s)]
*  Because aluminum does get recycled. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=32.2s)]
*  You can recycle it, yeah. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=33.2s)]
*  It does get recycled. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=34.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's no problem. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=35.2s)]
*  We were so heartbroken reading this article recently about plastics, about how it's like [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=36.2s)]
*  5%, right? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=40.0s)]
*  5%? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=41.0s)]
*  Single use plastics get recycled? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=44.0s)]
*  Like all the, every time you throw your bottle in the right bin, you feel like you're a good [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=45.0s)]
*  person. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=48.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=49.0s)]
*  Mostly you're not. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=50.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm a good person. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=51.0s)]
*  I put it in the blue bin. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=52.0s)]
*  I'm a good person. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=53.0s)]
*  The right way to probably handle that, that's a whole different conversation, is just simply [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=54.0s)]
*  to burn it and reuse the energy. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=57.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  How would you do that though and not pollute the air? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=60.519999999999996s)]
*  We do that all over the world, especially in Europe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  You just put a scrub on the smoke stack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=67.16s)]
*  That's all you do? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=70.75999999999999s)]
*  Like that simple? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=71.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  It really is. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't have any, well come on, it must have some emissions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=76.16s)]
*  I mean, nothing is zero. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=77.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=78.75999999999999s)]
*  But it's very, very low. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  Is it like a car? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=80.75999999999999s)]
*  Or is it like a million cars? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=83.32s)]
*  I think it's probably less than a car. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=84.32s)]
*  It's not something I've looked at. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=87.0s)]
*  A million cars sounds gross, but that's our city. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=88.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=90.44s)]
*  Every day in Austin you get a million cars. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=91.44s)]
*  The emissions from waste burning, very, very low. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=93.16s)]
*  So I remember people worried a lot about dioxins and that kind of stuff. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=98.84s)]
*  Turns out we can get rid of virtually all of it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=102.4s)]
*  So is that the trade off? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Is the trade off you have some emissions from the burning of the plastics, but you're getting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=108.44s)]
*  rid of the plastics, which is a real, is it a net gain for the environment? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=114.56s)]
*  Because the plastics are a real, real problem, particularly in the ocean and in landfills [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=118.56s)]
*  and just it's a real issue. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  So the real issue here is once you decide to say you have to switch it into all these [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=125.16s)]
*  different bins, you have everyone sit, I was just at a conference in Stanford and you could [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=130.72s)]
*  just see everyone and I did the same thing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=135.4s)]
*  You're sort of like, oh my God, what am I going to do? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=137.48s)]
*  And you feel like you did the wrong thing no matter what you do. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=139.24s)]
*  And you probably did. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=141.98s)]
*  Most of it, as you just said, won't get recycled. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=146.04s)]
*  Because back in five, 10 years ago, we just took all of this and sent it to China and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=147.04s)]
*  had them recycle it. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  And this is why there's so much plastic in the oceans. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=154.76s)]
*  It's not because anybody just throw it out. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=157.48s)]
*  It's because we shipped it away to feel good about ourselves, but we didn't want to pay. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  And then of course, when you get this barge with all this crap plastic, you either say, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  we recycle it and spend a lot of money or maybe just happen to lose it on the ocean. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=169.56s)]
*  That's where most of this plastic actually comes from. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=175.6s)]
*  So the idea is if you just dump it out. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=178.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=180.28s)]
*  So if you burn it instead, it's no problem. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=181.28s)]
*  You just throw everything in one bucket. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=183.7s)]
*  You recycle the energy and it's very, very cheap for everyone. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=186.08s)]
*  Nobody has to sit and stand there and worry. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=189.8s)]
*  And you'll actually do what you just pointed out. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=192.24s)]
*  95% gets done anyway. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=194.88s)]
*  So if we just do that, it will have a net gain on the environment. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=197.64s)]
*  We'll remove plastics, like particularly from the ocean. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=202.44s)]
*  Who's that young gentleman that we've had on the podcast that developed that machine [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=205.6s)]
*  to extract the plastic from the ocean? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's the fastest. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, tip of your tongue, son. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  Very, very, I mean, he was, I believe he was 19 years old when he came up with the idea [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  and implemented it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=223.84s)]
*  He had like a few different models. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=225.2s)]
*  Boy on slot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=227.88s)]
*  Boy on slot. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=228.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=229.88s)]
*  Sorry, boy on. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=230.88s)]
*  My memory is shit in the morning. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=231.88s)]
*  But he figured out how to extract some of it and then they took that plastic and then [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=233.32s)]
*  converted it into things you could buy, like sunglasses and things on those lines. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=239.72s)]
*  And all of this is nice. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  And look, we should definitely try to clean up the ocean. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=245.72s)]
*  But again, I tend to think that we try to make it too hard. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=248.12s)]
*  If you actually want this to work for a population of about 8 billion, you need to have simple [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=252.48s)]
*  municipal waste recycling. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=257.76s)]
*  And that's very often just that you recycle glass, you recycle paper, you burn most of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=260.53999999999996s)]
*  the other stuff, and then you recycle some of the really valuable stuff. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't that cost a lot of money to do in places that are like strapped for resources? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=268.76s)]
*  Like one of the things that you always see when you see video footage of countries overseas [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=272.96s)]
*  that are impoverished is you see a lot of trash. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=278.14s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  You don't have the money to process it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=281.76000000000005s)]
*  No, no. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=282.92s)]
*  And that's why the first thing you want is just simply good trash collection so you get [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=283.92s)]
*  rid of it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  So we did a big project in Dhaka or for Bangladesh. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=290.36s)]
*  And one of the things we focused on was also just simply getting trash off the streets [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=293.76000000000005s)]
*  because it's unsightly, it actually leads to more crime, it leads to more destitution, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  probably also transmit disease. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=303.32000000000005s)]
*  And it's fairly cheap to get rid of. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=305.34000000000003s)]
*  This is not rocket science. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  So there's a lot of ways that you can do that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=308.86s)]
*  But instead, we come in and say, no, no, you need to recycle and you have three different [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=311.08s)]
*  baskets and all that kind of stuff. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=314.84s)]
*  No, you just need to get rid of it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=316.24s)]
*  That's how you also get rid of the plastics in the ocean. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=318.3s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=320.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  And I think we'll have that conversation a lot of times. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of these, oh, we should do the absolute best feels like it's a really good solution. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=325.0s)]
*  But very often it ends up meaning that you do stuff that will then only be implemented [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=329.84s)]
*  five percent and the other stuff is crap. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=334.36s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=337.88s)]
*  There should be a real public understanding of the dangers of these plastics and microplastics [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=340.28s)]
*  getting into your body, too. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=348.08s)]
*  It's just so weird that we've developed this entire society based on this petrochemical [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=350.52s)]
*  product that ultimately gets into your body and has negative effects. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=355.44s)]
*  So the microplastics are possibly an issue. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  It's not quite clear yet whether they are. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=366.47999999999996s)]
*  But that's a concern and that's certainly something we should look at. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=368.4s)]
*  But also remember, pretty much everything else that you have with plastics is incredibly [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=371.06s)]
*  useful. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=375.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=376.56s)]
*  It packages, which actually reduces loss of pretty much anything you can think of dramatically. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=377.56s)]
*  And of course, through COVID, we realized it's a really good thing to have one use plastic [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=382.23999999999995s)]
*  stuff. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=387.47999999999996s)]
*  So again, most things in the real world are both a problem and a benefit. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  And we need to find out how do we make it more of a benefit and less of a problem. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=393.5s)]
*  But we need to stop having this kind of say, oh, you can't have anything of this bad thing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=397.24s)]
*  That's not how we organize our society. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=402.36s)]
*  So that's not how we think. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=403.64000000000004s)]
*  And that's certainly not how we make good choices. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=407.32000000000005s)]
*  But if we know that there are alternatives to plastic and we know that there's so many [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=408.32000000000005s)]
*  different problems with plastic of being non-biodegradable, unless it's like there's some, isn't there [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=414.12s)]
*  some plastic that they can make with like plant fiber that's biodegradable? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=418.16s)]
*  Then there's the phthalates thing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=424.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure you're probably aware of this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=426.88s)]
*  Dr. Shanna Swan. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  Do you know this whole thing about what's happening to when women are pregnant and their [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=429.88s)]
*  bodies have levels of phthalates above a certain level? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=435.88s)]
*  It has an effect on the reproductive cycle of the child. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=440.28s)]
*  And they can do studies in mammals. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=444.15999999999997s)]
*  And they show that when the female is pregnant and she encounters these chemicals from plastics, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=447.64s)]
*  it fucks with the gender of the child, like where their taints shrink, which is weird, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=454.54s)]
*  but in mammals, apparently that's a representation of like whether or not it's a male or a female. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=461.9s)]
*  It's like one of the best distinctions, ways of distinguishing whether it's a male or a [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=466.18s)]
*  female is the size of the taint when it's a baby, because the male taint is 50 to 100% [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=470.9s)]
*  larger than the female taint. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  She's hilarious. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=476.1s)]
*  She's got a really funny thing on her Instagram about, because it also causes a decline in [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=477.1s)]
*  sperm production. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=483.90000000000003s)]
*  And so her way of approaching it that's funny is she has the Jizz Quiz and she does this [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=485.78000000000003s)]
*  thing. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=490.26s)]
*  She's like this adorable, like petite lady who is a brilliant doctor, but she's kind [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=491.26s)]
*  of being funny and at the same time like sounding the warning shot. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=497.86s)]
*  Like, hey, this is fucking with human beings' reproductive cycles. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=501.66s)]
*  And since the invention of petrochemical plastics that we use in basically everything, from [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=504.56s)]
*  point to today, there's a very clear drop in fertility rates, a very clear drop in male [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=510.46s)]
*  sperm count, a very clear drop in penis and testicle size, and with females, there's higher [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=516.46s)]
*  rates of miscarriages. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=522.46s)]
*  And she believes through her research that this is connected and that these chemicals [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=524.74s)]
*  that we're getting from these plastics are literally affecting the development cycle [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=529.34s)]
*  of human babies. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=534.14s)]
*  And look, I've done some work on this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=536.46s)]
*  So the thing you have to worry about. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=539.22s)]
*  So we should definitely be concerned about that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=541.5400000000001s)]
*  That sounds like a giant issue. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=543.22s)]
*  And we should certainly be looking at it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=544.98s)]
*  The best data, as I understand this, is the fact that sperm counts have gone down dramatically [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=547.14s)]
*  over the last 30 to 40 years. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=552.58s)]
*  You haven't looked at the taints? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=554.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=556.86s)]
*  Does it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=557.86s)]
*  Big time taint study. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=558.86s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=559.86s)]
*  And what it turns out, of course, is that you tell people that they have to abstain [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=560.86s)]
*  for a week, four days or a week. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=565.84s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=568.02s)]
*  And that's potentially possible that people would do in the 50s. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=569.18s)]
*  It's very unlikely it happens today. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=572.18s)]
*  And we know that they don't. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=573.86s)]
*  So you think more people jerk off now? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=574.86s)]
*  And that's why that's an interesting perspective. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=576.34s)]
*  I bet you're right. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=578.66s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=579.66s)]
*  Now I'm on team Bjorn. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=580.8199999999999s)]
*  The point is not that we shouldn't be concerned about issues and that we should be investigating [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=585.6999999999999s)]
*  things. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=590.34s)]
*  But you also got to remember, our civilization is actually really, really good at making [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=591.34s)]
*  sure that we are concerned about all the different things. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=595.98s)]
*  And how do we know? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=598.38s)]
*  Because we live much longer. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=599.5s)]
*  This is one of the things I think almost everyone forgets. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  In 1900, the average life expectancy on planet Earth was 32 years. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=604.9s)]
*  Last year, it was 74 years. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=609.9599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=611.22s)]
*  But you know why it was 32 years, right? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=612.22s)]
*  It was to a large extent. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=613.5s)]
*  It was infant mortality, about three quarters. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=615.02s)]
*  But what's happening is still that it goes up. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=617.5799999999999s)]
*  So this is a fantastic statistic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=620.3s)]
*  You're going to be surprised about this. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=622.12s)]
*  So even in rich countries, it goes up for every year you live. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=623.84s)]
*  It goes up three more months. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=627.84s)]
*  So for every four years, you actually become you get one more year in life expectancy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=630.26s)]
*  You should be young Jamie forever. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=635.6s)]
*  Kind of you're going to run out of runway eventually. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=638.08s)]
*  But the point here is that we're actually really good at doing these things. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=640.96s)]
*  And yes, we should still be concerned. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=644.9200000000001s)]
*  One of the reasons why we're good at it is because we're good at being concerned. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=646.6s)]
*  But we should not be so scared that we end up thinking, oh my God, all these things are [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=650.0s)]
*  going wrong. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=654.74s)]
*  I don't think people are necessarily scared. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=655.74s)]
*  But they should. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=657.62s)]
*  I think they should be concerned. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=659.02s)]
*  And I think we should recognize when things are detrimental to human health. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=660.64s)]
*  You know, like the plastics thing, like to just to dismiss that and go, well, everything's [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=665.96s)]
*  better than it was before. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=670.7s)]
*  And you live longer. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=671.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=672.94s)]
*  But it might like literally be affecting the way human beings develop in a negative way. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=673.94s)]
*  And who knows what? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=677.42s)]
*  I mean, right now they're looking at sexual side effects. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  What kind of cognitive improvement or cognitive impairment side effects does it have? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=681.76s)]
*  What kind of I mean, who the fuck knows? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=687.76s)]
*  And we had a very good example of that with lead. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=690.8s)]
*  Yes, I was going to bring it up. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=693.4799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=694.4799999999999s)]
*  And that was a terrible idea. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=695.4799999999999s)]
*  Please explain the story behind that, because it's really bananas. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=697.14s)]
*  So the fundamental thing is it makes your gasoline run a little better. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  So you added this lead to all cars and stops your car from knocking. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=705.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=710.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=711.56s)]
*  Those old engines like bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=712.56s)]
*  And they didn't do it quite as much. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=713.56s)]
*  I love the sound effects. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=715.32s)]
*  Those old you ever see those old shitty cars? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=716.32s)]
*  Man, they were fucking those like guns were going off. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=718.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=721.0s)]
*  And and and you know, and it just had that huge side effect that actually makes us all [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=722.0s)]
*  dumber population. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=725.12s)]
*  Giant populations of cities lost many percentage points of IP. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=727.8s)]
*  So like three to five IQ. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=731.44s)]
*  That's not five percent. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=733.92s)]
*  Just so your car could run smoother. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=736.14s)]
*  And and and this again, you know, it shows because we all remember, I don't know, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=737.94s)]
*  the Thaldey, the idea that you were doing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=742.74s)]
*  Phalidomide. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=745.54s)]
*  Yeah, sorry. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=746.54s)]
*  I just read these words. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=747.54s)]
*  I don't actually say never heard phalidomide baby before. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=748.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=751.1800000000001s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=752.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  And the point is, there are these terrible stories and they're sign markers to tell us [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=754.1800000000001s)]
*  we should be careful. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=757.1s)]
*  But again, I also just want to come back to realizing that when you look at the whole [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=758.94s)]
*  picture, we're actually doing amazingly much better. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  Remember, at the same time, we lost these five IQ points. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=765.4s)]
*  What we see now in IQ development is that kids are getting smarter and smarter, probably [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=768.5999999999999s)]
*  because you get better food, you get better childhood, you get better education, you get [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  more stimulated. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=777.56s)]
*  There are all these kinds of things. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=778.56s)]
*  So we've actually gone up 30 IQ points or something over the last 100 years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=779.56s)]
*  So at the same time as it's a little controversial because you try to standardize a hundred. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=783.9599999999999s)]
*  Fundamentally, what you've seen is a dramatic increase in IQ. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=789.34s)]
*  And yes, lead was a stupid idea. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=792.6600000000001s)]
*  We've taken it out and it's mostly cleared up. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=795.74s)]
*  And now you say dramatic increase in IQ. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=798.3000000000001s)]
*  What's that attributed to? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=800.4200000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of controversy. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=802.0600000000001s)]
*  We don't quite know. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=804.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, as I mentioned, we think it's because kids are no longer starving. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=805.1600000000001s)]
*  They get good nutrition. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=810.98s)]
*  They get much more stimulated. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=813.94s)]
*  One of the important things is that kids get stimulated when they're young, that they actually [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=815.4399999999999s)]
*  get to play around and learn stuff. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=819.6s)]
*  Video games is probably also one of the things that actually increase your eye-brain coordination. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=823.04s)]
*  You shouldn't tell people that. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=828.8s)]
*  Then they're just going to play video games. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=829.8s)]
*  I'm increasing my brain coordination. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=831.8s)]
*  I think that's actually been proven though, hasn't it? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=834.12s)]
*  That it has a similar effect on the brain as traditional games of intellect, like chess. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=836.64s)]
*  So it's nuts. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=843.24s)]
*  Well, it again, so I guess the point that I try to make, and I'm sure we'll get to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=844.68s)]
*  that when we start talking about global warming and all the other problems, is that we need [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=849.54s)]
*  to recognize that we have real problems in this world. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=853.26s)]
*  But it's not that the world is sort of, the wheels are coming off, which is very often [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=856.3199999999999s)]
*  the conversation that I think a lot of people feel like they're in. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=861.3s)]
*  When you ask kids and young people, for instance, on climate change, they're terrified. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's an unfortunate thing because a lot of these young kids that are gluing [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=870.6600000000001s)]
*  themselves to paintings, they don't have a real perspective. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=875.0600000000001s)]
*  They're like 18, 19 years old, and they really think like they're saving the world. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=878.2s)]
*  Because their brains aren't fully formed, and they've been devouring propaganda like [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=881.9000000000001s)]
*  it's cheesecake. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=886.62s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=887.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=888.98s)]
*  It's like, you know, I had on Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock yesterday, and the podcast [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=889.98s)]
*  would be released on Thursday. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=894.4000000000001s)]
*  And it's this amazing podcast talking about moments in the Earth's history where the Earth [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=896.54s)]
*  experienced asteroid impacts, comet impacts, and that there's a period around 12,000 something [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=903.9s)]
*  years ago where we for sure got hit by these big impacts of either exploding in the sky [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=912.42s)]
*  above Earth or hitting the ground. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=920.78s)]
*  There's plenty of physical evidence of this, and it's called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=924.36s)]
*  But they were talking about the rapid change in the climate, how the sea levels rose, the [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=928.28s)]
*  ice caps melted, all because we got pummeled by asteroids. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=933.48s)]
*  This shit has gone on forever. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=937.3s)]
*  That's just natural stuff from getting hit by space. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=940.1s)]
*  If you look at the cycles of, if you go back a million years in Earth and look at all the [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=942.9399999999999s)]
*  highs and lows, you're like, oh, this thing's never been stable without us even existing. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=949.18s)]
*  It's never been stable. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=954.18s)]
*  So I guess the question is, how much of an effect are we having on these wild cycles? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=955.68s)]
*  What can you really blame it on? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  And what can we do, if anything, to turn it around? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=963.5999999999999s)]
*  So those are the reasonable questions, right? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=967.78s)]
*  Yes, and a long one. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=969.7399999999999s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=971.02s)]
*  I got a little carried away. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=972.02s)]
*  I get excited about this one because it seems kind of cultish. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=973.02s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=976.02s)]
*  So look, if you look around and if you look back in time, absolutely, there's been huge [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=977.02s)]
*  changes as you point out. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=981.26s)]
*  Sea levels from an ice age to today has gone up, what, 400 feet. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  Without us even doing shit. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=989.46s)]
*  With nothing from our impact. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=990.9s)]
*  With all that said, so that's sort of the background, and that's important to know. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=994.78s)]
*  We don't live in thousands of millions of years. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=998.62s)]
*  We live right now. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1001.74s)]
*  And we kind of care about what's going to happen in the next 100, next 200 years. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1002.86s)]
*  To a large extent also because we built all of our cities. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1007.3s)]
*  So Austin is built in a pretty warm climate, I'm assuming, coming from southern Sweden. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1010.02s)]
*  I think it's a lot warmer here than it is where I'm from. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1015.22s)]
*  Yeah, a lot warmer. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1018.1s)]
*  So cities are built to the temperature that they used to have for the last 100 years. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1019.74s)]
*  So if temperatures change, even if it's just somewhat, it'll be inconvenient. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1025.74s)]
*  It'll actually be a problem. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1030.46s)]
*  And that, I think, is really why we're talking about global warming. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1032.1s)]
*  It's a problem that we are causing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1035.1399999999999s)]
*  So we are actually changing the temperature. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1037.46s)]
*  Not by these enormous amounts that you're talking about. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  They're not the asteroids of the world, but there is an issue that we should be careful [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1042.62s)]
*  about and that we should pay attention to and that we should talk about. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1047.58s)]
*  So how do we fix it in the best possible way? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1050.86s)]
*  Well, before you go to that, how do we know how much of an impact our society is having [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1053.3799999999999s)]
*  on the overall effect? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1059.58s)]
*  If there is a warming of the globe, how do we know how much of an impact our point is? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1061.4199999999998s)]
*  Is there a real science that points out the amount of carbon and the emissions that we [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1067.4199999999998s)]
*  release has X amount of effect, which will equal this amount of temperature rise? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1071.3799999999999s)]
*  Is that solidified? [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1076.6599999999999s)]
*  So I'm a social scientist, right? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1078.5s)]
*  So I basically just read all the UN climate. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1080.82s)]
*  I'm one of those guys, yes. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1083.3799999999999s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1084.78s)]
*  Should I leave now? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1085.78s)]
*  So I basically just take for granted what the UN climate panel guys are telling us. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1088.3000000000002s)]
*  I think they have, I've spoken to a lot of them. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1092.66s)]
*  I've read a lot of their work. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1095.66s)]
*  I think they're really trying hard to show that what they typically say is between half [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1097.38s)]
*  and all of the change that we've seen over the last hundred years is because of us. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1102.0600000000002s)]
*  And they've sort of trended towards all because of us. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1107.6200000000001s)]
*  It feels like that's possibly a little bit too much. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1112.9s)]
*  Most of it is certainly because of us. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1115.94s)]
*  Most of the change in climate is because of us. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1117.86s)]
*  So most of the change that is about two degrees Fahrenheit that we've seen in change over [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1119.58s)]
*  the last 150 years. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1124.46s)]
*  And that's all because of carbon, it's all because of methane from cattle production. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1126.26s)]
*  It's basically because we use fossil fuels and then we also, as you say, emit coal, oil, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1131.26s)]
*  gas, and then a little bit of farts from cows. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1136.26s)]
*  And so that has not necessarily been a good thing for the earth. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1139.34s)]
*  No, not when you just look at the impact on climate. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1144.78s)]
*  Because as I said, if you built your cities and if you built your lives around one temperature, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1148.3400000000001s)]
*  if it changes a little bit, that's a problem. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1153.42s)]
*  If the oceans boil, just move in a little. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1155.66s)]
*  But it's not the oceans are going to boil. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1158.6200000000001s)]
*  Have you not seen the girl who throws the soup? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1161.14s)]
*  She has a whole video on YouTube. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1163.82s)]
*  The girl threw the soup on the Van Gogh. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1165.94s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1167.5s)]
*  She's making some really good points. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1168.02s)]
*  She's making some really good points. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1169.26s)]
*  She might be able to turn you around. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1170.14s)]
*  Maybe I should leave. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1171.18s)]
*  So really, the point here is this is a problem, but it's not the end of the world. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1173.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's really where we need to get back to and realizing this is not what [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1178.1s)]
*  is going to change our entire future. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1182.62s)]
*  It's going to have a negative impact. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1185.4599999999998s)]
*  But remember also at the same time, fossil fuels have basically made it possible for [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1188.06s)]
*  us to have the Industrial Revolution and become incredibly safe in so many different ways. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1192.78s)]
*  I mean, how did you get here this morning? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1197.78s)]
*  I flew. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1199.62s)]
*  You flew. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1200.3799999999999s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1201.54s)]
*  I drove. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1202.8999999999999s)]
*  I was hoping you'd say so. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1203.54s)]
*  I drove an electric car. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1204.34s)]
*  I'm good for the environment. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1205.06s)]
*  There you go. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1206.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1206.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1207.58s)]
*  I'm doing my part. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1207.86s)]
*  I feel virtuous. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1208.74s)]
*  I bet you do. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1210.26s)]
*  But most people actually get around. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1212.1399999999999s)]
*  Your food is produced by fertilizer, which is very often from gas, natural gas, our transportation, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1214.1399999999999s)]
*  our electricity. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1222.3799999999999s)]
*  Pretty much everything is mostly focused around fossil fuels. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1223.1399999999999s)]
*  It's pretty nuts to bank everything on this one thing. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1227.26s)]
*  It's very bizarre how society has moved completely in that direction. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1230.38s)]
*  How many things that we need fossil fuels to create, containers and tires and this and [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1235.18s)]
*  that and clothing and sneakers and eyeglasses. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1241.98s)]
*  I mean, there's so much shit that we use fossil fuels for. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1245.38s)]
*  It makes you wonder. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1249.7s)]
*  I wonder what would have happened if we never took that path as a culture. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1250.7s)]
*  If we only used fossil fuels for fuel and we never figured out how to turn it into stuff. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1255.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1260.8600000000001s)]
*  We would have been a lot poorer. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1261.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1262.8600000000001s)]
*  We never had computers. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1263.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, we would think about what it looked like in around 1800 in England. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1264.8600000000001s)]
*  That would probably be where we'd be about. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1270.14s)]
*  The point is, of course, and you're making that argument really well, fossil fuels are [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1273.14s)]
*  just an incredible boon to civilization. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1277.0600000000002s)]
*  And then they also have this problem. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1280.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1282.74s)]
*  And so that's where we need to find a way to slowly and eventually find ways to produce [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1283.74s)]
*  all of that stuff you just talked about without the negative impacts of fossil fuels. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1289.22s)]
*  And that's going to be hard. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1293.46s)]
*  And that's not an easy trip. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1294.46s)]
*  What about nuclear? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1296.1s)]
*  Nuclear absolutely could be part of the solution. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1297.7s)]
*  So people are incredibly frightened about nuclear. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1299.9s)]
*  But remember, if you look at what it actually takes to produce energy, nuclear is one of [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1302.66s)]
*  the safest things possible. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1308.54s)]
*  Now, all technologies have risk. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1310.6200000000001s)]
*  If you put up solar panels, you'll have some people falling down from the roofs putting [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1313.1s)]
*  them up. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1316.54s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1317.54s)]
*  This is a hazard, an occupational hazard. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1318.54s)]
*  But solar panels are some of the safest things together with nuclear. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1323.6999999999998s)]
*  So Chernobyl, which was by all kinds of ways a terrible accident. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1330.06s)]
*  I'm glad you said that. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1334.06s)]
*  I thought you were pro-Chernobyl for a minute there. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1335.06s)]
*  I'm going to say no, no, I'm not. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1338.58s)]
*  So Chernobyl probably killed in the order of 100 to 200 people, which is not nothing. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1341.5s)]
*  But it destroyed the area. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1348.78s)]
*  This is the biggest catastrophe we've ever had with nuclear power. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1350.7s)]
*  Regularly coal-fired power kills millions of people. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1354.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1358.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1359.82s)]
*  Millions. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1360.82s)]
*  Millions across the world. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1361.82s)]
*  How do millions of people die from coal power? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1362.82s)]
*  So this is basically because, especially in the developing world, you don't put scrubbers [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1363.82s)]
*  on your smokestacks. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1368.42s)]
*  So it just makes it incredibly polluted. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1369.42s)]
*  If you've ever been to New Delhi in the fall, I'm assuming it's a little bit worse than [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1371.38s)]
*  it was to be back in London in the 1950s. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1379.66s)]
*  You almost can't see your way forward and you can just feel it in your throat and everything. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1382.5400000000002s)]
*  Apparently — [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1387.8600000000001s)]
*  And you inhale all the way. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1388.8600000000001s)]
*  Like fires, like fireplace fires. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1389.8600000000001s)]
*  A lot of people think that's good. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1394.9s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1396.42s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1397.42s)]
*  Burning wood like that is one of the worst things for the air. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1398.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1402.0600000000002s)]
*  So what people don't get is — [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1403.0600000000002s)]
*  If everybody did it, it would be horrible. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1404.0600000000002s)]
*  And we're going to have a lot more of that in Europe this winter because of the whole [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1406.42s)]
*  Russian issue. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1409.98s)]
*  But what people don't get is most of the world's poor — so about 3 billion people on this [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1410.98s)]
*  planet — they cook and keep warm with really dirty fuels like dung, cardboard, wood, whatever [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1416.38s)]
*  they can get their hands on. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1422.16s)]
*  And that means the average indoor air pollution in these homes is higher and worse than it [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1423.72s)]
*  is in outdoor Beijing. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1429.96s)]
*  The World Health Organization estimates it's equivalent for each person to smoke two packs [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1433.92s)]
*  of cigarettes every day. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1438.14s)]
*  So they're cooking indoor with fires? [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1440.18s)]
*  And you keep warm with these because it gets cold at night. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1445.08s)]
*  And we don't have any sense of these impacts. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1448.44s)]
*  So let me just tell you a fun story. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1453.24s)]
*  In Denmark, the environmental agency, they were trying to find out how much indoor air [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1455.56s)]
*  pollution do you get if you're right next to a major street. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1461.16s)]
*  And so they were measuring — they rented this apartment that was empty and put up [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1465.1s)]
*  measurements in there. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1469.52s)]
*  And every once in a while, they couldn't understand they just got these incredible [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1470.8s)]
*  spikes in there. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1473.56s)]
*  And they were like, this shouldn't be coming from outside, right? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1475.3s)]
*  It was when the neighbor lit candles. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1479.6399999999999s)]
*  That tells you how dangerous it is. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1483.96s)]
*  People think it's really nice to have the fire and the stove or these candles on, but [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1485.6399999999999s)]
*  actually incredibly polluting. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1492.32s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1494.32s)]
*  Well, some people go nutty with the candles. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1495.48s)]
*  That's got to be horrible. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1498.0s)]
*  Like, if someone has their whole — like Ari Shafir's special, Jew, which is out right [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1499.0s)]
*  now on YouTube. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1502.3799999999999s)]
*  You're just going to bring that up. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1503.3799999999999s)]
*  Let's go to that. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1505.1799999999998s)]
*  Go to a clip of it. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1506.1799999999998s)]
*  My friend Ari Shafir was polluting the environment. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1507.3799999999999s)]
*  Not only does he not care about the environment, but he snuck in pollution. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1510.1s)]
*  I'm sure he did this shit on purpose. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1515.1399999999999s)]
*  It's available right now on YouTube. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1516.6999999999998s)]
*  Behind Ari, best special he's ever done — look at all those candles! [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1519.26s)]
*  He's killing the air. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1523.82s)]
*  He's forcing people to breathe toxic fumes while he's doing his jokes. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1525.1799999999998s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1529.6999999999998s)]
*  They look real, though. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1530.6999999999998s)]
*  No, they're real. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1531.6999999999998s)]
*  They had a life of eight hours of lit when they were normal, but then when they turned [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1532.94s)]
*  the air conditioning on, the air was blowing down on the candles. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1538.98s)]
*  So they were burning through the — so this lady had to get like extra candles overnight. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1542.06s)]
*  It was a giant affair. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1545.42s)]
*  Like 9,000 candles overnight. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1546.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1548.98s)]
*  And mind you, they just pumped up the air pollution as well. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1549.98s)]
*  But anyway, Ari Shafir — [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1552.54s)]
*  Burn it, Jew. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1553.54s)]
*  It's available right now on YouTube. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1554.54s)]
*  He's got over 2 million views. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1555.54s)]
*  So he's polluting the environment by doing that. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1559.66s)]
*  So people that do fireplaces, you think, oh, it's going to be so romantic, sit by the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1562.42s)]
*  fireplace. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1567.0200000000002s)]
*  You're polluting the environment. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1568.0200000000002s)]
*  If everybody did, it would be horrible air quality. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1569.0200000000002s)]
*  You're polluting your own indoor environment. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1570.6200000000001s)]
*  So I mean, in that sense, I'm like, all right, it's a little bit like skydiving. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1573.98s)]
*  But man, if you're camping — [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1577.6200000000001s)]
*  It's fine if you take it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1578.6200000000001s)]
*  If you're camping and you have a little campfire going on, maybe it's a little bad for the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1579.94s)]
*  environment. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1584.6200000000001s)]
*  But how good is it for you? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  That's where people draw that line. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1587.1000000000001s)]
*  Like, no one's out here. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1588.2600000000002s)]
*  No one is out here in the middle of nowhere. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1590.0200000000002s)]
*  And we're staying alive with actual fire warming up. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1592.6200000000001s)]
*  But when you go then to India, they burn all their fields right next to New Delhi. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1596.66s)]
*  So the problem is poverty. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1601.18s)]
*  And what gets us out of poverty quicker? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1603.22s)]
*  And that's petrochemical products, fossil fuels. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1605.42s)]
*  It's basically energy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1608.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's the capitalist versus the Marxist argument about this stuff. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1609.8600000000001s)]
*  Sorry, I'm a graph guy. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1614.6200000000001s)]
*  So if I can show on the B2? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1616.66s)]
*  I like how you have a wood cover. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1618.66s)]
*  It looks cool, no? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1624.14s)]
*  On your MacBook. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1625.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1626.14s)]
*  So this is — you see how rich people are out the X — the horizontal axis. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1627.14s)]
*  And then you see how much energy you have up on the Y axis. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1632.78s)]
*  And what you basically see is the richer you are, the more energy you use the other way around. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1637.66s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1642.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1643.3400000000001s)]
*  This is not rocket science, right? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1644.3400000000001s)]
*  Climate change people that fly around in private jets are the biggest hypocrites. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1645.3400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1648.86s)]
*  You're selling that and you're going to the World Economic Forum on a fucking jet with [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1649.86s)]
*  three people in it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1654.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1656.74s)]
*  Get out of here, man. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1657.74s)]
*  You loser. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1658.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1659.74s)]
*  So what is — are you conspiratorial about this push towards a climate change — or [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1660.74s)]
*  towards a climate change crisis mentality where there was a famous Project Veritas video [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1670.02s)]
*  with a guy who worked for CNN and they caught him on undercover camera and they were talking [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1677.14s)]
*  about using climate change to get people excited? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1682.02s)]
*  I assumed he was talking about four ratings, which makes sense. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1685.5800000000002s)]
*  If you're a producer and you work in Hollywood, you know, if the Kardashians are fighting [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1690.46s)]
*  with their boyfriend, get in there, let's go. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  That's money, right? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1697.14s)]
*  That's what you do. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1698.22s)]
*  And if that's happening — oh my God, the climate. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1699.22s)]
*  Like everyone freaks out. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1701.14s)]
*  The climate. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1702.14s)]
*  They're glowing their hands to Picasso's. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1703.14s)]
*  Oh Jesus, the climate. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1704.7s)]
*  If that's going to get you ratings, your job is to get ratings. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1706.46s)]
*  Your job is not to educate the American people. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1709.46s)]
*  You can barely figure out life yourself, right? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1711.54s)]
*  You're 34 years old. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1713.9s)]
*  You've got a half a million dollars in student loans. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1714.9s)]
*  You can't believe you work for CNN. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1716.74s)]
*  What are you supposed to do? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1718.54s)]
*  You're supposed to fucking put the climate change in everybody's face because that's [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1719.54s)]
*  how you're going to sell tickets. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1723.14s)]
*  That's what they're doing. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1725.26s)]
*  So climate has that wonderful opportunity that it can actually fundamentally get us [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1726.26s)]
*  to talk about every time something out there happens. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1730.74s)]
*  And it can be news and it can be somebody's fault. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1734.54s)]
*  Every time there's a flood, every time there's a storm, every time there's anything. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1737.46s)]
*  Heart attacks, climate change. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1741.1s)]
*  I'm sure they'll come up with that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1742.1s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1743.1s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1744.1s)]
*  No, that's real. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1745.1s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1746.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's articles written about the climate change maybe causing all these sudden [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1747.1s)]
*  deaths and heart attacks. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1750.6200000000001s)]
*  And look, again, there is something to this. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1752.34s)]
*  So the idea that when you have very high temperatures, you actually have more heart attacks and you [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1754.7s)]
*  have more people dying. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1759.98s)]
*  So yes, heat deaths are bad. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1761.34s)]
*  You also have more people dying if they're not taking care of their body and no one talks [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1765.26s)]
*  about that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1769.34s)]
*  Climate change causes heart attacks. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1770.4199999999998s)]
*  A second look at the data. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1771.82s)]
*  How good is the evidence implicating climate change as a cause of heart attacks? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1774.6599999999999s)]
*  Not very. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1779.9199999999998s)]
*  Let's take a critical look at some of this research. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1780.9199999999998s)]
*  So a slew of recent studies suggested that climate change increasing the number of heart [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1783.74s)]
*  attacks worldwide. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1786.86s)]
*  The hypothesis suffers from many critical deficiencies. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1788.88s)]
*  The most important being that rates of heart disease and thus heart attacks in the industrialized [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1791.56s)]
*  world have plummeted as our ability to prevent and treat coronary artery disease has improved. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1795.28s)]
*  Studies reported a slowdown in this trend have...studies that have reported a slowdown [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1801.6s)]
*  in this trend have also detected rises in the prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1807.64s)]
*  and type 2 diabetes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1812.68s)]
*  What we were just saying. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1813.68s)]
*  All well-known risk factors for heart disease. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1815.16s)]
*  So it's not that climate change is causing heart disease. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1817.6s)]
*  It's that people are doing things that they shouldn't be doing with their body in terms [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1822.08s)]
*  of like letting their body get obese or not taking action and going to the gym and altering [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1827.8799999999999s)]
*  their diet and they need encouragement. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1832.9199999999998s)]
*  And it should be...if you really wanted to like lower costs for health care worldwide, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1835.1999999999998s)]
*  especially nationwide, a national program encouraging people. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1839.0s)]
*  Instead of just putting like a black square on your Instagram on Tuesday, how about encouraging [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1843.56s)]
*  people through one entire month to do a hundred sit-ups and a hundred push-ups and go up, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1847.6s)]
*  you know, walk 10,000 steps every day. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1853.48s)]
*  Just encouraging people and everybody have to fucking be accountable online. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1855.96s)]
*  If everybody did that, people would just shed weight. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1859.8799999999999s)]
*  They would shed weight. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1863.44s)]
*  All sorts of medical problems would go away if they're capable of doing this, of course. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1864.44s)]
*  If they're not, if they already have a health problem, it's obviously not their fault. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1868.08s)]
*  There's so many people that can improve their life and there's no encouragement to do it. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1871.76s)]
*  All they talk about is like the fear of what happens if this comes for you. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1875.0s)]
*  The fear. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1879.3200000000002s)]
*  The climate is going to make you have a stroke. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1880.3200000000002s)]
*  The climate is going to make you stay indoors. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1883.16s)]
*  The oceans are going to boil. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1885.5600000000002s)]
*  It's like, Jesus Christ, tell me what I can do to make life better right now. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1886.8400000000001s)]
*  And so you're absolutely right. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1891.52s)]
*  We can do a lot ourselves. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1892.6000000000001s)]
*  With that said, though, it's not that there is nothing to this point. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1894.72s)]
*  So can I just show the same? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1898.64s)]
*  Well, I'd imagine if it gets hotter, people are going to have heart attacks. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1900.92s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1904.2s)]
*  But that's because they're not very resilient. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1905.2s)]
*  Well, but it's especially old people. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1907.1200000000001s)]
*  It's not unreasonable to say that this is going to be an issue. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1910.3200000000002s)]
*  There is a lot of people out there telling us, oh my God, there are going to be more [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1914.16s)]
*  heat deaths because of global warming. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1917.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's scary. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1919.0400000000002s)]
*  It is scary. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1920.0400000000002s)]
*  You also have to then, if I can show B3, you also have to see. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  So what this shows, this is a new Lancet study from 2021. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1925.6s)]
*  Each year, rising temps save 166,000 lives. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1930.76s)]
*  This is kind of surprising, right? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1934.76s)]
*  You know who told me that the first time? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1937.8s)]
*  But Randall Carlson said, he goes, climate change where it gets warmer, it's not necessarily [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1939.08s)]
*  good, but climate change where it gets colder is bad. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1946.08s)]
*  That's bad. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1949.6s)]
*  He said, everybody is scared about global warming. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1950.76s)]
*  You should really be scared about global cooling. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1952.8s)]
*  He's not dismissing global warming. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1955.08s)]
*  He's saying, understand, when temperatures drop, you can't grow food, kids. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1956.6799999999998s)]
*  It gets bad. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1961.04s)]
*  And then we're really fucked. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1962.6s)]
*  So if I can just show you this one up here. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1963.6s)]
*  So if you look, there's an enormous amount of cold deaths in the world. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1965.9599999999998s)]
*  So there's about four and a half million people die from cold every year. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1969.0s)]
*  In the US, 170,000 people die from cold every year. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  Why? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  Because every winter, you actually have to keep your home heated well for six months, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1979.92s)]
*  especially up in the north. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1986.4s)]
*  Canada. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1988.0400000000002s)]
*  In order to not have arteries clogged, you have heart attacks, that kind of thing. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1989.0400000000002s)]
*  What happens when it gets colder and you get cold, the body restricts its blood flow out [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1993.48s)]
*  to the surface, and you get higher blood pressure. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=1998.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's a very well-known risk factor for getting heart attacks. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2002.0s)]
*  So you actually have a lot of people that die because they don't get enough heat, especially [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2006.72s)]
*  older people. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2011.76s)]
*  I never would imagine that many people freeze to death. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2012.76s)]
*  And this, of course, the point. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2015.0s)]
*  Do you remember the heat dome last year? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2016.48s)]
*  The heat dome. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2018.8s)]
*  The thing that killed a lot of people up in Washington and British Columbia. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2019.8s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2026.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2027.2s)]
*  So there was a huge heat wave. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2028.2s)]
*  It killed, what, 700 people. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2029.2s)]
*  Huge issue. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2031.8s)]
*  Covers of all papers and CNNs and all that for a week. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2033.8s)]
*  And that is a real problem. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2039.6399999999999s)]
*  That's certainly something that we're going to see more of from climate change. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2040.9199999999998s)]
*  But you never hear about this fact that 170,000 people die from cold every year in the US. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  I've never heard that before. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2050.12s)]
*  And this is not some quack science. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2051.72s)]
*  This is the Lancet. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2054.24s)]
*  This is the global burden of disease. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2055.24s)]
*  How many did you say, sir? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2056.72s)]
*  What's the number? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2057.72s)]
*  170,000. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2058.72s)]
*  Wasn't that what the Lancet just said? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2060.64s)]
*  What was the paper? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2062.4399999999996s)]
*  Put the paper up again so we can take a look at it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2063.4399999999996s)]
*  So that's the global burden of disease. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2065.8399999999997s)]
*  If you go to GBD. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2067.8799999999997s)]
*  I just typed in cold deaths in the US per year. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2071.3199999999997s)]
*  And it said since 1979, only 19,000 people have died from cold related diseases. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2073.3999999999996s)]
*  That's because if you ask, and there's another organization that just keeps track of how [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2078.8799999999997s)]
*  many people died from cold if you actually got in the newspaper. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2084.56s)]
*  That's of course very, very few. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2089.88s)]
*  Most of these are statistical deaths. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2091.52s)]
*  So these are deaths that happens because whenever the temperature is lower, there's a slightly [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2093.2s)]
*  higher risk of dying. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2098.0s)]
*  And that slightly higher risk is the cold death. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2099.6s)]
*  Oh, so is this like a died with COVID or died from COVID thing? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2102.7599999999998s)]
*  Are these people that are already dying and then it gets really cold and they die? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2106.72s)]
*  No, no. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2110.68s)]
*  They would not have had this problem had they not been experiencing this cold. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2111.9199999999996s)]
*  So every year you see, so if you take over the year, you see this trend. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2117.2s)]
*  So from January, it's high and then the death rate is low and then it gets high again. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2122.8199999999997s)]
*  This is basically because cold is dangerous and heat not nearly as much. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2128.8399999999997s)]
*  How are they attributing those deaths directly to cold? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2134.64s)]
*  What is the statistic that you looked up? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2138.7999999999997s)]
*  And what's the source of that? [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2140.44s)]
*  So key points. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2143.0s)]
*  So this is from, what is this from? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2145.04s)]
*  The EPA. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2147.8s)]
*  Government.climate. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2148.8s)]
*  So this is the EPA. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2149.8s)]
*  Between 79 and 2016, the death rate as a direct result of exposure to cold underlying causes [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2150.96s)]
*  death. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2157.12s)]
*  So that's freezing to death. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2158.12s)]
*  That's not like strokes and heart attacks. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2159.12s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2161.4s)]
*  Deaths actually range from one to 2.5 deaths per million people. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2164.72s)]
*  With year to year fluctuations, overall total of more than 19,000 Americans have died from [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2169.2s)]
*  cold related causes since 1979 according to death certificates. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2174.2799999999997s)]
*  So what are they putting on the death certificate of these people that are dying that you're [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2179.2599999999998s)]
*  counting with the 166,000? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2182.2799999999997s)]
*  So sorry, the 170 for the US or? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2184.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, whatever the Lancet study said, 166. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2188.3599999999997s)]
*  The Lancet study is a global study and that was an increase in the number of people. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2191.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2195.56s)]
*  So United States 170,000. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2196.72s)]
*  That's the global burden of disease. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2199.16s)]
*  So they are an international study out of University of Washington that tries to estimate [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2200.92s)]
*  all the deaths and where do they come from. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2205.72s)]
*  So people die from all kinds of things, but what was the proximate cause of this? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2208.08s)]
*  Was it too hot? [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2212.68s)]
*  Was it too cold? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2213.68s)]
*  Was it that you were in an accident? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2215.0s)]
*  All these kinds of different things and a lot of, this is the kind of thing where you [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2217.7999999999997s)]
*  say obesity causes a lot of deaths. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2221.72s)]
*  I can't remember what that is, like a million deaths. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2225.0s)]
*  But it's not on the death certificate. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not on the death certificate because it's a statistical correlation that you died [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  right after the cold or the heat snap. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2235.6s)]
*  Is there a potential to manipulate that in one way or another? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2239.48s)]
*  Look, again, does someone has a political bias to push one thing or another? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2243.4s)]
*  So yes, there is a way. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  So for instance, curiously, everybody that dies from heat die after one or two days. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2249.84s)]
*  So that's why it's such good news. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2256.88s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2259.04s)]
*  Such good newscasting. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2260.52s)]
*  When it happens, you can show the bodies right there. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2262.8s)]
*  When you have cold deaths, it typically happens after 15 to 30 days. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2265.64s)]
*  So you need to have cold for a long time because then you're starting to work that up and your [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2271.44s)]
*  body restricts your temperature. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2275.84s)]
*  That's what causes it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2278.52s)]
*  So you really need to lag these. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2279.52s)]
*  A lot of times you don't do that analysis and so you only find the heat deaths but not [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2281.08s)]
*  the cold deaths. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2285.2s)]
*  So there's a wonderful study that actually showed back in the late 2000s when fracking [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2287.12s)]
*  came on board. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2295.04s)]
*  They found that gas prices went down. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2296.96s)]
*  So about half of all Americans heat their homes with gas. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  And so what happened was you actually could show that because people could now afford [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2304.64s)]
*  to heat their homes better, especially if they were poor, that actually every year saves [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2309.68s)]
*  about 11,000 people from dying from heat, sorry, from cold deaths. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2314.6s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2318.8799999999997s)]
*  It is amazing. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2320.04s)]
*  So these cold deaths, we're talking about people who because of being in freezing cold [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2321.04s)]
*  temperatures, they have a variety of different detrimental health problems. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2326.72s)]
*  Like what is it? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2332.56s)]
*  Is it just because they're older folks? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2335.2799999999997s)]
*  It's almost entirely older people. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2339.3999999999996s)]
*  This is not because they're sitting and shivering and you can sort of see the ice. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2341.3799999999997s)]
*  It's just they're a bit more fragile when it's cold at night. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2346.7599999999998s)]
*  It's just that their homes are not all that well heated. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2349.74s)]
*  And you have to keep the heat on at night. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2352.8399999999997s)]
*  And they can't quite afford it. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2355.48s)]
*  And so they keep it like one or two or three degrees lower than they probably want it to. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2356.8s)]
*  No one thinks that kills people. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2361.92s)]
*  No. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2363.4s)]
*  And the reason why it kills people is because this is a lot of millions of people. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2364.4s)]
*  And each one of them are put into this little risk factor. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2369.96s)]
*  And the overall point that I tried to make with that graph and with the Lancet study [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2373.64s)]
*  was just that you hear all this thing about more heat deaths. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2377.66s)]
*  And that's absolutely true because of global warming. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2381.64s)]
*  But you never hear the fact that as temperatures rise, you're of course also going to see fewer cold deaths. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2384.6s)]
*  And actually right now it turns out that we're seeing many fewer cold deaths than we're seeing [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2388.6s)]
*  increasing heat deaths. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2393.24s)]
*  What's more preventable, the heat deaths or the cold deaths in terms of like medical intervention? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2394.68s)]
*  So it's actually not medical intervention. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2400.92s)]
*  It's just air conditioning. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2403.32s)]
*  No, IVs, like fluid IVs. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2404.32s)]
*  They do that a lot to people that get severely dehydrated. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2406.32s)]
*  But again, remember, these are not people that have been freezing water for 10 minutes [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2408.96s)]
*  or something. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2415.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2416.52s)]
*  These are people that are just a little too cold or a little too warm. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2417.52s)]
*  And the simple way to deal with that is air conditioning. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2420.16s)]
*  That's why as temperatures have risen in the US, we've seen declining levels of heat deaths [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2422.8s)]
*  because you guys can afford air conditioning. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2427.64s)]
*  And that's of course what we need to make sure that the rest of the world can afford. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2429.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's actually easier to deal with heat because we know how to do that. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2433.16s)]
*  Whereas cold requires you to have cheap energy for the whole heating season. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2437.08s)]
*  And that's much, much, much costlier and harder, especially for poor people. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2441.7599999999998s)]
*  So when people talk about our impact on the world with oil and how we're ruining the future [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2447.0s)]
*  of our planet and so the hysteria of these young people, what do you think is the thing [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2456.6s)]
*  to try to give them a more balanced perspective of what's actually happening? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2462.86s)]
*  Like if you think it's a problem, you think what people are doing is a problem, but it's [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2468.94s)]
*  not as big of a problem. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2472.7400000000002s)]
*  That's what kind of has to be balanced out because it's either everything or it's nothing. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2475.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the narrative that we hear today. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2480.2200000000003s)]
*  Either global warming is not an issue at all. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2481.86s)]
*  Oh, you silly goose. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2483.98s)]
*  Why are you worried about that? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2485.46s)]
*  Or it's, oh my God, we're all going to die. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2487.06s)]
*  Those are the only two options you have. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2489.6600000000003s)]
*  And I want to get people to understand that global warming is a problem, but it's actually [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2491.42s)]
*  mostly a problem in the sense that the world is getting better and better. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2496.98s)]
*  But because of global warming, it gets slightly slower, much better. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2500.7400000000002s)]
*  That's a hard one to tell. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2505.44s)]
*  Can I just show you one graph? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2506.66s)]
*  Slightly slower, much better? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2507.66s)]
*  So it gets better and better, but slightly slower. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2508.9s)]
*  Let me show you two graphs. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2511.6s)]
*  So if I can show you from A22. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2512.7200000000003s)]
*  So it's impeding our progress. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2515.78s)]
*  Yes, it's impeding our progress slightly. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2517.1800000000003s)]
*  Slightly. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2519.5s)]
*  So what kind of a percentage are we talking about? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2520.58s)]
*  Let me just first, if I can just show you A22. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2522.62s)]
*  So this one shows the deaths over the last century of all the things that you think of [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2530.86s)]
*  as climate, right? [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2536.3s)]
*  Floods, droughts, storms, wildfires, and extreme temperatures. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2537.3s)]
*  They don't do a particularly good job on extreme temperatures, but let's just leave it at that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2540.14s)]
*  This is the best data that we have for the world. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2544.1s)]
*  And what it basically shows is the complete opposite of what these guys that are gluing [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2546.4s)]
*  themselves to the Picasso, right? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2550.92s)]
*  This is fundamentally a situation of back when you were poor in the 1920s, about half [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2552.84s)]
*  a million people died every year. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2558.4s)]
*  You know what would be amazing to look at right next to that? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2561.2000000000003s)]
*  The deaths from donuts. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2564.36s)]
*  It would be the total opposite direction. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2565.36s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2567.76s)]
*  Look, look, getting richer means that you can allow yourself to go die from lots and [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2568.76s)]
*  lots of donuts. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2575.7999999999997s)]
*  But it's a decision. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2576.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's a lot of poor people as well. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2577.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, that food's cheap and it's filling, you know, but if you looked at food related [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2579.24s)]
*  deaths, let's see if there's food related deaths. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2584.68s)]
*  How many, like how would you just, how would you make that distinction of people who, would [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2587.2s)]
*  it be people who died from obesity and diabetes? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2591.0s)]
*  Like how would you say that? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2594.12s)]
*  It's obviously a lot of other autoimmune diseases that come from being obese. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2595.4s)]
*  There's not just a few. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2601.96s)]
*  So like the 500,000 from 1920, I bet we hit that every year from obesity. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2603.32s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2609.36s)]
*  In America? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2610.36s)]
*  Like what do you think it is in America? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2611.36s)]
*  Like heart disease and that's... [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2612.44s)]
*  Heart disease is probably a couple million. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2614.6800000000003s)]
*  That's a lot, right? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2616.6000000000004s)]
*  But the heart disease one can be attributed to genetics. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2617.6000000000004s)]
*  Two and a half million dead in total in the US, so it's probably one million or something. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2620.1600000000003s)]
*  And how many of that, how many of those you could attribute to sedentary lifestyle and [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2624.98s)]
*  How many of it's just unfortunate genetics? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2630.0s)]
*  Because that happens as well. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2632.8399999999997s)]
*  What do you think, give me a, is there, does anybody do an accounting on how many people [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2634.24s)]
*  die from obesity every year? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2639.04s)]
*  Oh God, yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2640.7599999999998s)]
*  Just the... [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2642.12s)]
*  Very sure. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2643.12s)]
*  That's like the bottom line, right? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2644.12s)]
*  Like you, they're attributing it to you on your death certificate, they're saying obesity. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2645.12s)]
*  That can't be that many, right? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2651.6s)]
*  How many is that? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2652.6s)]
*  I'm going to imagine that, I don't know. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2653.6s)]
*  I think all the other effects, like heart attacks, strokes, all the things that come [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2655.6s)]
*  from being obese, diseases, susceptibility to diseases. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2659.16s)]
*  But I think your point is well taken, right? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2663.48s)]
*  Because it tells you that all these protesters that are gluing themselves up there and are [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2665.36s)]
*  worried about the end of the world from climate change should be much more worried about a [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2669.08s)]
*  doughnut. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2673.04s)]
*  They should glue themselves to Krispy Kreme. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2674.04s)]
*  Krispy Kreme is damn good though, especially when it comes out warm. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2675.04s)]
*  When I look this up, it's a contributing factor. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2678.48s)]
*  I don't know that it's listed as like... [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2681.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was getting at. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2683.72s)]
*  It seems like it'd be hard to quantify. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2685.56s)]
*  Is it hard to quantify? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2687.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, because like if someone's fat and they get cancer, like is that what happened? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2688.8s)]
*  What caused it? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2694.2400000000002s)]
*  Would they have gotten cancer anyway? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2695.2400000000002s)]
*  This is what burden of disease actually does. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2696.2400000000002s)]
*  So they do this for the whole globe. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2697.44s)]
*  They would probably parcel it out for obesity as well. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2700.04s)]
*  Yeah, obviously that was one of the big things that people had a problem with with COVID [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2705.36s)]
*  deaths. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2708.48s)]
*  There was people that were already terminally ill and got COVID and they attributed it to [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2709.48s)]
*  COVID. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2711.92s)]
*  Your body is like an ecosystem. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2713.8399999999997s)]
*  If you have like a major insult coming into your body, like being obese or a disease or [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2715.7599999999998s)]
*  if you live in one of these horrible places that has massive amounts of pollution, that's [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2721.0s)]
*  something that must affect... [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2725.08s)]
*  That is a big impact on longevity, right? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2726.48s)]
*  Like people that live in those polluted cities. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2729.24s)]
*  And just being poor. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2731.52s)]
*  Bad nutrition, bad healthcare, all the above, stress, violence, all of that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2732.52s)]
*  But that's not convenient, Bjorn. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2739.4s)]
*  That's not good for our little conversation. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2742.44s)]
*  Our conversation is I have to glue myself to the Van Gogh and throw fucking soup at it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2744.0400000000004s)]
*  Can I just show you on B8? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2749.36s)]
*  I have a quick question on the climate one. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2751.32s)]
*  I was just watching a movie about World War I last night. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2757.88s)]
*  That's why I asked this. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2760.1600000000003s)]
*  Wouldn't war deaths, shouldn't they maybe be included or would they be very high in [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2761.1600000000003s)]
*  like this first area, like 1920, 1940? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2764.44s)]
*  Climate rate? [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2767.7599999999998s)]
*  War deaths? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  Comparing like millions of people died because of war and other things due to the war. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh God, yes. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2775.12s)]
*  This would be much bigger and centered around 1940. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2776.12s)]
*  But I'm only looking at... [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2781.64s)]
*  Right, but not for climate change. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2782.64s)]
*  Floods, droughts, storms and wildfires. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2784.24s)]
*  I was also... [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2786.4s)]
*  I didn't... [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2787.4s)]
*  What giant floods or... [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2788.4s)]
*  I'm not saying there weren't. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2790.4s)]
*  I've just never heard of any. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2791.4s)]
*  They killed hundreds of thousands of people. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2792.4s)]
*  No, I think what he's talking about with climate-related deaths is mostly people freezing [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2793.4s)]
*  to death. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2796.8s)]
*  Well, no. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2797.8s)]
*  So, sorry. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2798.8s)]
*  This is exactly the point. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2799.8s)]
*  I'm sasking for clarity. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2800.8s)]
*  There was huge floods in China and India in the 1920s, 1930s. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2802.5600000000004s)]
*  Huge famines. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2807.36s)]
*  Things that we just never heard of. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2809.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, we heard a little bit about it back then, but then we've forgotten it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2810.52s)]
*  And then when we hear about these things that will cause a thousand deaths... [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2814.84s)]
*  Remember, let me take an example I know a lot more about. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2819.2400000000002s)]
*  The world's biggest hurricane death was in Bangladesh in 1970. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2822.88s)]
*  It was a big hurricane that came in, killed somewhere between 300 and 500,000 people in [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2828.8s)]
*  Bangladesh. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2833.8s)]
*  This was mostly because they were totally unprepared. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  There was very bad communication. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2838.32s)]
*  It was also East Pakistan back then. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2839.32s)]
*  That was one of the reasons why they broke loose, because they felt they weren't really [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2841.44s)]
*  being taken care of. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2844.8s)]
*  Today, and this in many ways defined Bangladesh, and so they have taken great care in getting [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2846.52s)]
*  much better prevention. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2852.08s)]
*  They have information. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2853.96s)]
*  They have these centers where you can assemble up in high areas where you can actually keep [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2855.16s)]
*  everyone safe and stuff. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2859.18s)]
*  So now the same kind of hurricanes come in and they kill sort of tens or hundreds of [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2860.68s)]
*  people instead. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2865.08s)]
*  Did you see that community that they established in Florida that survived this last hurricane [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2866.08s)]
*  with flying colors? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2870.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that a word? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2873.7599999999998s)]
*  You know that expression. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2874.7599999999998s)]
*  If you go to... [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2876.64s)]
*  What was the hurricanes called? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2877.64s)]
*  The last one, the big one that just hit Florida? [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2880.84s)]
*  Ian? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2882.6400000000003s)]
*  If you go to Hurricane Ian Solar Community, Florida, I believe it's 2,000 homes. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2883.6400000000003s)]
*  They're completely off grid in the sense that they have a solar field and it powers these [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2890.6000000000004s)]
*  homes and they built homes to withstand hurricanes. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2896.6000000000004s)]
*  So this is a bad hurricane. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2900.0800000000004s)]
*  So it was a really good test for them and it nailed them. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2901.88s)]
*  And everything was fine. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2904.8s)]
*  They kept their internet. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2905.92s)]
*  They kept their electricity. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2907.1000000000004s)]
*  So isn't that wild? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2908.76s)]
*  Look how they did that. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2909.76s)]
*  They have this massive, massive field of solar panels. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2910.76s)]
*  So it's called Babcock Ranch. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2914.2400000000002s)]
*  And this community was established just to give people a safe place from a natural disaster. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2917.0s)]
*  Because a lot of the houses they built before, the engineering when they were building these [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2924.3s)]
*  houses in the 1950s, did they really know how to survive a fucking hurricane? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2928.5200000000004s)]
*  You know, they just built a good house. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  They tried their best. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2935.0s)]
*  But see if you can get some photos of what the houses look like. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2936.0s)]
*  They look like normal houses. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2938.84s)]
*  But they built these houses with very strong tolerances. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2940.4s)]
*  And they can take incredible winds and they look like a regular fucking house. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2944.36s)]
*  It's not like they're space houses. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2948.5s)]
*  They're built like a wind turbine or something like that. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2950.12s)]
*  No, they're normal houses, but they're just really robust. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2953.8s)]
*  And these people all made it through, which is pretty wild. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2957.16s)]
*  And Joe, I think it emphasizes something. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2960.04s)]
*  We know how to fix many of these problems. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2962.44s)]
*  If you just disregard the solar part, which of course kept them powered, but there's many [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2965.64s)]
*  other ways you could have done that with batteries as well. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2970.48s)]
*  But that's a great way. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2972.56s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2973.56s)]
*  But the main point is you should have better regulation for houses if you want most houses [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2974.56s)]
*  to survive. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2980.36s)]
*  This is very, very cheap. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2981.36s)]
*  There's a good study for Hurricane Sandy and also for Hurricane Andrew back in 92. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2984.32s)]
*  Had there been better regulation, so you just had clamps, for instance, on roofs, these [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2989.34s)]
*  costs what, $5 or something? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2994.58s)]
*  You could have avoided half of all the damage. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2996.5s)]
*  Because the roofs peel off. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2998.38s)]
*  Yeah, this is very, very simple stuff. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=2999.94s)]
*  And so again, because we're so worried about one thing, namely climate change and saying, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3002.48s)]
*  oh my God, we got to go to electric cars and stop using fossil fuels and all this other [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3006.62s)]
*  stuff. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3010.9s)]
*  No, actually, you need to have clamps. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3011.9s)]
*  And this is the kind of conversation that we have a very hard time getting around to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3014.86s)]
*  that just like we started off talking about with plastics. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3019.06s)]
*  A lot of the solutions are not, they're not nearly as comforting, but they're just much [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3022.66s)]
*  simpler, much cheaper, much more effective. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3026.74s)]
*  So what is the solution in terms of reducing our carbon footprint without destroying the [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3029.06s)]
*  economy? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3034.06s)]
*  Well, so I think first of all, we need to get rid of the panic because panic is just [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3035.06s)]
*  a really, really bad way of dealing with issues. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3039.5s)]
*  But it's a really good way to get people to vote. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3042.02s)]
*  And it's a really good way to get people to donate money to your parties. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3044.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3048.02s)]
*  But it also leads to us all just running around screening. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3049.02s)]
*  Screaming. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3052.7400000000002s)]
*  Because I wanted to show you this, that the progress is actually just slightly delayed. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3053.98s)]
*  So if I could show you the B8. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3058.7000000000003s)]
*  This is because of climate change. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3063.2200000000003s)]
*  Our progress is slightly delayed. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3064.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3066.46s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3067.46s)]
*  And I just wanted to show you. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3068.46s)]
*  So this is malaria death since 1900 until 2060. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3069.46s)]
*  This is obviously prediction from 2020. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3073.6200000000003s)]
*  This is the World Health Organization estimating what will happen with global warming. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3077.1800000000003s)]
*  You've heard this story, right? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3081.46s)]
*  No, I haven't heard that everyone's going to die of malaria. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3082.46s)]
*  Because of global warming, there's going to be more places where malaria can survive and [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3085.54s)]
*  that's going to give us all malaria. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3089.7400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3091.1s)]
*  Makes sense. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3092.1s)]
*  And there is some truth to this. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3093.1s)]
*  So what you see here is that you will actually, with climate, you will actually have slightly [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3094.1s)]
*  higher levels of malaria death than if there was no climate change. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3099.3s)]
*  So what we're looking at for folks who are just listening, there is a really high line [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3103.3s)]
*  in the 1900s. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3107.76s)]
*  It goes from zero to 200. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3110.1200000000003s)]
*  The line is almost at 200 in the early 1900s and it drops all the way down to what looks [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3111.82s)]
*  like two in 2060. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3117.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's pretty stable from like 2040 to 2060. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3120.4s)]
*  And from that point, and it's below what it is now, by the way, but that point above it [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3123.8s)]
*  with climate is maybe two and a half. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3128.82s)]
*  It's on top of the line. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3132.32s)]
*  It's like touching the line. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3133.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's a very, very small number. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3135.24s)]
*  Not that it's good for people to die of malaria. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3137.2799999999997s)]
*  And what this tells you is they're right when they come out and tell you there's going to [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3139.7999999999997s)]
*  be more malaria with global warming. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3143.2s)]
*  But how much more? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3144.8799999999997s)]
*  But yeah, but you're missing the greater picture, which is, look, things are going to be a lot [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3145.8799999999997s)]
*  better but slightly slower, a lot better. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3149.2799999999997s)]
*  And could that be mitigated with malaria medication? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3152.7999999999997s)]
*  Of course it could. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3155.7999999999997s)]
*  Of course it could. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3156.7999999999997s)]
*  So if you actually care about malaria, your right answer is not to say we got to change [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3157.7999999999997s)]
*  the entire growth engine of the world and stop using fossil fuels. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  No, the right answer is to make sure that people get malaria medication, that they get [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3166.24s)]
*  bed nets. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3169.92s)]
*  There's a lot of these simple things. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3170.92s)]
*  Remember, this does not mean that we shouldn't also try to fix global warming. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3173.56s)]
*  We're a smart species. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3178.56s)]
*  We can walk and chew gum at the same time. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3179.56s)]
*  But we seem to almost entirely just go to the straight answer. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3181.52s)]
*  Whatever the problem is, the answer is to cut carbon emissions. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3185.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's often not the best or the most effective way to help people first. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3188.48s)]
*  There are some real ironies. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3193.56s)]
*  One of the crazy ones is coal-fired plants powering Teslas. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3195.72s)]
*  That is one of the wildest trade-offs that we make, and that happens every day in this [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3201.64s)]
*  country. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3209.48s)]
*  Someone is getting into their Tesla thinking they're doing a really good job, and the electricity [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3210.48s)]
*  to power that Tesla is from a coal-fired plant. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3213.6s)]
*  That's bananas. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3217.48s)]
*  And a lot of that could be avoided with nuclear. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3219.28s)]
*  The problem with nuclear is if it f**ks up, you ruin that spot for a long time. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3222.92s)]
*  True. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3230.36s)]
*  That's what scares people. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3231.36s)]
*  But that's the initial applications of nuclear, like Fukushima. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3232.36s)]
*  They didn't have enough fail-safes. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3235.6s)]
*  These are older plants, and they think that they can mitigate a lot of those problems [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3238.2400000000002s)]
*  with newer plants, and there's even designs for newer plants. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3241.88s)]
*  They can actually safely shut down. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3244.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3246.08s)]
*  They should all be able to safely shut down, but clearly Fukushima was not well enough [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3247.7999999999997s)]
*  to sign because they basically put them in a place where the backup generators could [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3252.64s)]
*  be hit by... [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3256.72s)]
*  That one's nuts. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3259.72s)]
*  But even in that one, I don't believe very many people died from Fukushima. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3260.72s)]
*  No, nobody died. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3263.72s)]
*  Some people died because you evacuated everybody, but it was really not a big risk. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3265.64s)]
*  But it was a big risk to the ocean, right? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3271.92s)]
*  Isn't there a significant problem with... [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3273.44s)]
*  No, that was a very, very small bit. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3275.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3276.84s)]
*  I thought it was spilling over into the ocean. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3277.84s)]
*  There's radioactive water in the ocean. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3279.1600000000003s)]
*  It did. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3280.6400000000003s)]
*  But again, remember, the Pacific Ocean is very, very large, and there's a lot of natural... [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3281.6400000000003s)]
*  So it dilutes it enough. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3285.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and there's a lot of natural radiation almost everywhere in the world. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3286.1600000000003s)]
*  Most people don't get the idea that your vast exposure of radiation comes from living in [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3290.2000000000003s)]
*  a stone house. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3297.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you have like... [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3298.6800000000003s)]
*  Bricks. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3300.1600000000003s)]
*  Like a brownstone in New York? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3301.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, because most stone has natural radiation. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3303.52s)]
*  But it's not a negative radiation. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3309.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not a terrible one. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3310.52s)]
*  By no means this is not... [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3312.0800000000004s)]
*  Don't freak out again. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3314.2400000000002s)]
*  But the whole point here is to recognize that we don't have a good sense of proportion of [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3315.2400000000002s)]
*  what's the risks that we're really exposing ourselves to. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3319.7200000000003s)]
*  The main issue with nuclear, and this of course is why we're not getting lots and lots of [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3323.48s)]
*  nuclear, is that nuclear is incredibly expensive right now. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3327.52s)]
*  So new nuclear power plants of the current third generation just cost a lot of money. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3330.8s)]
*  So they're actually more expensive than going to solar and wind, and that's really why we're [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3336.2000000000003s)]
*  not building a lot of them. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3340.5600000000004s)]
*  How much more expensive? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3341.92s)]
*  So some of the new ones that are being done in France and Finland and the UK have ended [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3343.2400000000002s)]
*  up being two to four times more expensive than they were planned, and so they're easily [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3351.6400000000003s)]
*  sort of two, three times more expensive. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3356.28s)]
*  More than they were planned to be? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3359.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3360.68s)]
*  So they go way over budget, and the total cost of the electricity they all produce could [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3361.68s)]
*  easily be two or three times the cheapest electricity you can get. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3367.72s)]
*  How much of that is fraud? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3371.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3373.56s)]
*  Because whenever they have construction that goes way over, I think about the big dig in [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3374.56s)]
*  Boston. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3378.52s)]
*  Do you know about that? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3379.52s)]
*  No. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3380.52s)]
*  The big dig was a thing that was going on when I was a kid, and a bunch of people went [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3381.52s)]
*  to jail. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3384.64s)]
*  So we can hear where it's going, at least. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3385.64s)]
*  They were slow playing the dig in this tunnel because they didn't want the jobs to go away, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3388.56s)]
*  and they did a terrible job. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3393.16s)]
*  It took forever. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3394.92s)]
*  I think they called it one of the most corrupt construction projects in the history of the [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3396.4s)]
*  United States. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3401.32s)]
*  And that's saying something. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3402.32s)]
*  It finished more than ten years after it was supposed to be finished. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3404.08s)]
*  I got already moved out of Boston, but I came back many, many years later. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3407.44s)]
*  I'm like, this thing's still around? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3411.04s)]
*  They're still doing this? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3412.6s)]
*  $14.8 billion later, the big dig finally complete. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3413.96s)]
*  When the clock runs out on 2007, construction of the big dig, the nation's most complex [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3417.8s)]
*  and costliest highway project, will officially come to an end. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3422.84s)]
*  They were doing that when I was living in there in the 1980s. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3426.36s)]
*  They were working on it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3430.16s)]
*  They finished it in 2007. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3431.16s)]
*  So what is the, like, it was super corrupt, right? [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3432.76s)]
*  Didn't a bunch of people go to jail? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3435.96s)]
*  I'm not saying that the people that are making the nuclear power plants are doing the same [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3439.12s)]
*  thing. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3442.12s)]
*  They started at $2.6 billion and ended up at $14.8. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3443.2799999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3446.08s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3447.08s)]
*  But I think it tells a different story. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3448.08s)]
*  Certainly for... [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3451.12s)]
*  Holy shit, that's so much money. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3452.12s)]
*  Certainly for nuclear, what happens is that you want one more failsafe and then one more [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3454.52s)]
*  failsafe. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3459.3199999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3460.3199999999997s)]
*  They keep on changing the rules and making the regulations so it's going to be even harder. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3461.3199999999997s)]
*  And again, that's not a bad thing. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3465.08s)]
*  It sounds like a good thing. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3466.92s)]
*  Failsafe's not good. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3468.2799999999997s)]
*  But you also want to have a sense of, well, how safe are we going to be here compared [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3469.44s)]
*  to all the other stuff that is also risky? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3474.0800000000004s)]
*  We constantly make trade-offs. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3477.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3478.6800000000003s)]
*  We should not pay attention to this, but I see what you're saying. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3479.6800000000003s)]
*  We should give equal focus to all these other problems that the world has. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3482.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's not what we do. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3486.2000000000003s)]
*  We focus on one thing. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3488.28s)]
*  So you asked me what should we say to these guys that, you know, glue themselves to famous [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3490.1400000000003s)]
*  paintings. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3495.32s)]
*  And I think first it is to get them to realize this is not the image. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3496.32s)]
*  We should work in a coal mine. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3499.48s)]
*  This is not the end of the world. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3500.48s)]
*  For a year. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3501.48s)]
*  I would never ask that of anyone. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3502.48s)]
*  So they should realize this is not the end of the world. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3505.56s)]
*  And I think that would take away a lot of this, oh my God, we got to do something right [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3508.32s)]
*  now. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3512.1600000000003s)]
*  And then we can start talking about, okay, how do you fix things smartly? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3513.1600000000003s)]
*  Well you don't fix getting rid of fossil fuels by telling everyone, I'm sorry, would you [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3517.6800000000003s)]
*  mind being a little poor and a little colder and not be able to drive? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3522.6s)]
*  Would that be okay with you? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3526.48s)]
*  You don't win elections that way. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3529.24s)]
*  You don't actually get things done. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3530.94s)]
*  The way you fix problems is through innovation. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3533.2599999999998s)]
*  So if you think back to Los Angeles in the 1950s, it was a terribly polluted place, mostly [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3536.2799999999997s)]
*  because of cars. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3541.7s)]
*  There's special sort of geography that makes it very possible for all the pollution just [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3544.48s)]
*  to get stuck in that dome in Los Angeles. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3548.54s)]
*  And it's cars. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3552.24s)]
*  So the current way we think about environment is basically, all right, the solutions back [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3553.7s)]
*  then would have been to tell everyone in Los Angeles, I'm sorry, could you walk instead? [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3558.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3562.58s)]
*  And no, that wouldn't have worked. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3563.58s)]
*  What did work was the innovation of the catalytic converter. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3565.74s)]
*  So in 1974, this guy comes up with this little thing you put on, it cost a couple hundred [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3569.3399999999997s)]
*  dollars, and basically it takes away all the pollution from the car. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3573.66s)]
*  How cool is that? [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3578.18s)]
*  It's pretty cool, but not all the pollution. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3579.18s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3580.42s)]
*  But you can drive a lot longer and pollute a lot less, which is why Los Angeles is enormously [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3581.82s)]
*  much cleaner. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3586.88s)]
*  It's still not clean. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3587.88s)]
*  Here's a take for innovation. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3588.88s)]
*  Here's an interesting piece of information. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3589.88s)]
*  In polluted cities, some cars, like particularly Jeremy Clarkson was talking about this on [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3592.7000000000003s)]
*  Top Gear. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3598.7000000000003s)]
*  Some cars like a Porsche Turbo, which is a very efficient car and has incredible air [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3600.38s)]
*  filters. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3605.98s)]
*  The air coming out of the exhaust is actually cleaner than the air going in. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3607.62s)]
*  There you go. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3610.94s)]
*  Make sure that's true. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3611.94s)]
*  Make sure that's true, because I'd be an asshole if it's not true. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3612.94s)]
*  But Jeremy Clarkson definitely said that. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3615.06s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, wow, maybe that is the solution. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3616.7s)]
*  We should buy a Porsche to everyone. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3618.98s)]
*  No, not a Porsche, but a car that's sucking in the carbon. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3621.46s)]
*  Everyone should before they die own one of those though. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3624.8599999999997s)]
*  But if you could get a car that is somehow or another utilizing that fuel that's in [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3627.38s)]
*  the air that's problematic, and if there's some sort of a way to extract that and convert [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3632.86s)]
*  it maybe through some unforeseen technology, convert that into energy. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3638.7400000000002s)]
*  This sounds implausible. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3644.02s)]
*  Does it? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3645.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3646.5s)]
*  It sounds like it's very... [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3647.5s)]
*  So we're doing the same thing with carbon, that you're trying to suck out the carbon [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3648.5s)]
*  from the atmosphere, and it turns out to be very expensive. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3652.5s)]
*  All combustion engines require oxygen, right? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3655.82s)]
*  Would it be possible for a combustion engine at least to somehow work carbon neutral by [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3659.3s)]
*  pulling enough carbon out of the atmosphere that the... [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3666.54s)]
*  Whatever comes out the bag is actually not good. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3670.02s)]
*  This is what he said. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3671.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3672.5800000000004s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3673.5800000000004s)]
*  Jeremy Clarkson said, when you drive this car through a really polluted city, Los Angeles, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3674.5800000000004s)]
*  Calcutta, I don't know what the other one is. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3676.86s)]
*  Harrogate. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3678.86s)]
*  Harrogate. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3679.86s)]
*  I think he was joking around. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3680.86s)]
*  Something like that. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3681.86s)]
*  The gas coming out of the exhaust pipe is less toxic than the air going into the engine. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3682.86s)]
*  And I'm not joking, that's true. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3686.86s)]
*  And then... [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3689.02s)]
*  This then is like a small, efficient, easy to use vacuum cleaner. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3691.5s)]
*  Okay, so he's joking around about that. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3695.54s)]
*  But is that true? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3697.18s)]
*  Is it true? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3698.18s)]
*  Does it say it's true, Jeremy? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3699.18s)]
*  What does it say? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3700.18s)]
*  It doesn't say that it's true or false. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3701.18s)]
*  It doesn't say it's true or false. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3702.18s)]
*  So that is his quote. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3703.18s)]
*  Well, I have seen concept cars that clean the air. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3705.18s)]
*  I seriously doubt any car existing... [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3707.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's what this is. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3709.2599999999998s)]
*  But again... [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3710.74s)]
*  Except, especially the Porsche 911. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3711.74s)]
*  Oh, because this is bullshit. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3713.46s)]
*  So he's saying it's bullshit. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3714.86s)]
*  I seriously doubt any existing cars, especially the Porsche 911 Turbo, emits exhaust that [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3716.02s)]
*  is cleaner than air, even air in the most polluted cities. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3720.54s)]
*  Here's exactly what Clarkson says. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3724.34s)]
*  So this is by Autoblog. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3725.78s)]
*  So Autoblog is calling bullshit, which makes sense. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3728.54s)]
*  Doesn't make sense. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3732.38s)]
*  But it's a fun story. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3733.38s)]
*  But if it could be, is it an engineering issue? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3734.86s)]
*  Is it possible that some new invention would be able to do that with the air? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3738.1s)]
*  So I'm essentially an economist. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3741.46s)]
*  I'm sort of a pretend economist because I'm really a political scientist, but I like to [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3743.82s)]
*  pretend I'm an economist. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3747.5800000000004s)]
*  Why do you do that? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3749.0600000000004s)]
*  Because economists are smart people. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3750.46s)]
*  So anyway, economists would tend to say you can do anything you want if you're willing [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3752.5400000000004s)]
*  to pay the money. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3756.7000000000003s)]
*  So we can take people to the moon. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3757.7000000000003s)]
*  We could potentially take all of Austin to the moon. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3760.3s)]
*  It would just be fantastically expensive. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3762.6200000000003s)]
*  And it's not clear that it would be really cool either. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3764.98s)]
*  They shouldn't take everybody to the moon. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3769.0600000000004s)]
*  No. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3770.5400000000004s)]
*  Just the people with Beto signs in their lawn. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3771.5400000000004s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3772.86s)]
*  So fundamentally, you can do a lot of stuff and you could also do this, but it would just [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3773.86s)]
*  be incredibly expensive, meaning you wouldn't have the resources to do all the other stuff [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3778.6600000000003s)]
*  you also want to do. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3783.1400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3784.1400000000003s)]
*  Hence, this is a Porsche turbo. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3785.1400000000003s)]
*  This is not a Hyundai or a Fiat. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3786.1400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3788.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a very expensive car. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3789.1800000000003s)]
*  So in terms of what we can do now to slow the stem, that's one of the fear-mongering [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3790.94s)]
*  things that you hear. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3799.42s)]
*  I don't know if it's accurate, but they're always saying if we don't do this now, with [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3800.54s)]
*  every day that passes by, if we don't enact legislation, the future is doomed. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3804.06s)]
*  This is the thing that people keep harping on. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3810.38s)]
*  How much of that is accurate? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3812.9s)]
*  That's just wrong. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3813.9s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the UN climate panel reports, there's nowhere they tell you this. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3814.9s)]
*  The quote, I don't know if you remember, this was AOC and many others telling us we have [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3819.46s)]
*  just 12 years left. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3823.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3824.7000000000003s)]
*  That was the argument that they asked the UN, what will it take to stick to 1.5 degrees [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3825.9399999999996s)]
*  centigrade, which is sort of an arbitrary target and almost impossible, probably impossible [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3833.7799999999997s)]
*  to do. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3838.2599999999998s)]
*  And so the UN said, if you want to do this almost impossible, you have to do everything [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3839.2599999999998s)]
*  before 2030, which was then 12 years away. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3844.62s)]
*  That's where the 12-year time limit come from. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3848.2599999999998s)]
*  It's basically saying if you want to do something incredibly stupid and incredibly expensive, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3850.8999999999996s)]
*  you only have 12 years left. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3855.3s)]
*  But that's not what the UN is telling us. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3857.0600000000004s)]
*  We should switch and we should cut carbon emissions. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3859.54s)]
*  But there are much, much smarter ways to do this. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3862.7400000000002s)]
*  So perhaps the most obvious one is what the US did back from late 2000s, which was fracking. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3864.86s)]
*  This is basically something that was done by investment research and development from [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3874.3s)]
*  George W. Bush in the early 2000s where they spent about $10 billion working with frackers [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3881.54s)]
*  to find out how do you frack gas and then later on oil. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3888.62s)]
*  And what that meant was you ended up, this was not at all meant as a climate policy. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3892.66s)]
*  It was meant as a way to get more energy. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3897.3s)]
*  But what it meant was you ended up getting much, much cheaper gas. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3899.46s)]
*  And because you had much cheaper gas, you switched out coal for gas. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3903.7000000000003s)]
*  This matters because gas is about twice as efficient. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3907.26s)]
*  It emits half as much CO2 per unit of energy. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3909.86s)]
*  So you basically have this situation where you made a somewhat cleaner source of energy [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3913.36s)]
*  much cheaper. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3918.56s)]
*  And so the US actually cut its emissions more over the last decade than any other country [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3919.6200000000003s)]
*  has ever done. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3924.1s)]
*  But is there a detrimental effect on the environment because of fracking that has to balance that [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3925.1600000000003s)]
*  out? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3929.42s)]
*  There is. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3930.42s)]
*  How much of an impact is that? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3931.42s)]
*  So there's, thank you for asking. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3932.42s)]
*  So there's a study that tries to look at what all the damages and all the benefits from [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3934.1400000000003s)]
*  fracking is. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3939.58s)]
*  And so they find the total damage from fracking is in the order of $25 billion, mostly from [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3940.7s)]
*  air pollution. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3946.4599999999996s)]
*  Air pollution. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3947.4599999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3948.4599999999996s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3949.4599999999996s)]
*  So does that negate the air pollution that it saves? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3950.4599999999996s)]
*  No. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3953.02s)]
*  So this is local air pollution and this is mostly from the increased amount of emissions, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3954.02s)]
*  especially of methane, but also just because you have lots of construction going on where [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3958.54s)]
*  you do the fracking. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3962.3799999999997s)]
*  And because fracking is a very rapid turnover, you need a lot of wells. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3964.2s)]
*  So there's a total cost, environmental cost, about $25 billion. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3968.42s)]
*  That's not nothing, absolutely, per year. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3972.78s)]
*  But the benefit of fracking to the US is estimated by one of the Federal Reserve estimates. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3975.38s)]
*  Right, but if I could push back against that, the real problem, you please do. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3982.38s)]
*  Yes, can I just say, sorry, so it's $180 billion in increased growth for the US. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3986.02s)]
*  So you get $180 billion, but you also have environmental problems of $25 billion. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3992.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, shouldn't we be doing everything possible to mitigate the amount of environmental problems? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=3998.08s)]
*  And when you're talking about just straight money, how much money is it worth to pollute [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4002.72s)]
*  the rivers and pollute the streams and pollute the air? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4007.0s)]
*  I would say that's not a benefit at all. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4010.3999999999996s)]
*  That benefit in terms of like the negative impact of pollution. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4012.9199999999996s)]
*  And then trying to clean up that pollution is catastrophic. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4017.5s)]
*  It's very difficult and sometimes impossible. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4020.3999999999996s)]
*  When you're talking about polluting ancient waterways, that scares the shit out of people, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4022.48s)]
*  including me, especially people that like to go outside and do outdoor activities and [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4028.18s)]
*  go camping and hiking and shit. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4031.46s)]
*  They get terrified by the idea of fracking, destroying the rivers. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4033.02s)]
*  And that has happened before, right? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4035.86s)]
*  Sure. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4037.86s)]
*  And look, again, most of the impact was air pollution, but there's also some water pollution. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4038.86s)]
*  And that is definitely an issue. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4043.02s)]
*  Again, we have to remember that running the current of energy system that we have in the [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4045.2200000000003s)]
*  US causes lots of pollution and it causes lots of benefits. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4052.82s)]
*  And we make those tradeoffs all the time. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4057.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4058.6s)]
*  But if we can contain it to the areas that it's already at, that would be more efficient [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4059.6s)]
*  than spreading it out to our rivers. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4062.92s)]
*  And we have done that. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4064.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4065.84s)]
*  Remember, air pollution, certainly in the US, has come down about 90 percent over the [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4066.84s)]
*  last 30 years. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4071.6s)]
*  So because of the Clean Air Act and many others, we've actually dramatically reduced air pollution. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4073.1600000000003s)]
*  And we know how to do that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4079.36s)]
*  You can absolutely regulate fracking better and you can decide that you want to have less [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4080.48s)]
*  air pollution. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4086.46s)]
*  But it is a tradeoff in the sense of saying how much more opportunity will you have? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4087.46s)]
*  And then you also actually cut carbon emissions, which is what the US has done more than any [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4092.1000000000004s)]
*  other country, versus how much do you want, for instance, less air pollution. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4095.94s)]
*  But for the people that live around those areas where they're fracking, that's not a [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4100.7s)]
*  good relationship. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4103.66s)]
*  No. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4104.66s)]
*  Although a lot of these guys, this is one of the reasons why fracking is taken off in [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4105.66s)]
*  the US and not anywhere else, because in the US, you own your own mineral rights. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4109.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4114.22s)]
*  The guys who own the land are the ones who typically get most of the, or not most of [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4115.240000000001s)]
*  the benefit, but a substantial benefit of the fracking. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4119.240000000001s)]
*  That's not true in Europe, which is why everybody then gets annoyed about the air pollution. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4122.04s)]
*  But if you get air pollution, but you also get like $200,000, many people will say, hmm, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4125.64s)]
*  I like that. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4131.320000000001s)]
*  Now, they probably like to have less air pollution. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4132.320000000001s)]
*  Doesn't RuPaul have like some crazy ranch where they extract natural resources? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4135.04s)]
*  I remember people reading about that going, wait, what? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4141.9800000000005s)]
*  There you go with the Mountain Dew. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4144.56s)]
*  Got excited. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4146.02s)]
*  First Mountain Dew of the day. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4147.02s)]
*  It is. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4148.38s)]
*  Are cigars bad for the environment? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4149.38s)]
*  They're certainly bad for you. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4151.38s)]
*  No. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4153.18s)]
*  What about George Burns? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4154.18s)]
*  He lived forever. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4155.18s)]
*  You think they're bad for you? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4156.18s)]
*  I'm pretty sure we know that. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4157.46s)]
*  You think they're worse for you than Mountain Dew? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4159.18s)]
*  I'm certainly hoping so. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4162.22s)]
*  You're over there sucking on Mountain Dew, talking to me about cigars. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4163.22s)]
*  Cigars are natural tobacco leaves. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4166.780000000001s)]
*  You don't even inhale. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4168.620000000001s)]
*  You just puff on it. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4169.620000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4171.34s)]
*  I don't think you possibly, possibly we should have a little warning sticker that don't take [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4172.94s)]
*  medical advice from this man. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4177.28s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4178.759999999999s)]
*  Hold up non-COVID content. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4179.759999999999s)]
*  RuPaul was just on NPR Fresh Air and shared that he and his partner own 60,000 acres in [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4181.28s)]
*  Wyoming and they lease mineral rights and sell water to oil companies. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4187.679999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4193.32s)]
*  Terry Gross did not follow up with one question about the fact that RuPaul is fracking. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4194.879999999999s)]
*  Oh, so it is fracking. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4199.799999999999s)]
*  We found that RuPaul, is that true? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4202.98s)]
*  Ru's partner is true. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4204.86s)]
*  Australian rancher George Labar owns seven parcels of land in Wyoming totaling some 66,000 [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4207.219999999999s)]
*  acres, Labar's company. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4212.54s)]
*  Labar Ranch leases that land to at least three oil companies. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4214.0599999999995s)]
*  Anadarko EP Onshore, Chesapeake Operating and Anshultz Oil Company. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4218.82s)]
*  Using FracTracker, we looked at just 10,000 of those acres and found more than 35 active [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4224.459999999999s)]
*  oil and gas wells. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4231.160000000001s)]
*  But then they also say all oil and gas drilling is bad. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4232.68s)]
*  All oil and gas drilling is bad. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4236.92s)]
*  You hear me, Bjorn? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4239.84s)]
*  This is a fact. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4241.400000000001s)]
*  It's on gizmodo, you son of a bitch. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4242.400000000001s)]
*  All oil and gas drilling is bad, but these three companies are no mom and pop shops. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4246.12s)]
*  Chesapeake Energy was a pioneer of the drilling method early in the nation's fracking boom. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4251.12s)]
*  It was the second most active drilling company in the nation, closely followed by Anadarko. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4256.14s)]
*  And Anshultz owner, Philippe Frederick Anshultz made billions from fossil fuel extraction [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4262.099999999999s)]
*  that earned him the 41st spot on the Forbes 400. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4268.22s)]
*  Wow, interesting. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4271.94s)]
*  Well, RuPaul is fabulous. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4273.26s)]
*  Go get it. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4275.0599999999995s)]
*  Get that money. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4276.0599999999995s)]
*  But again, if I can just say- [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4277.0599999999995s)]
*  So if it's your land, if it's your land, do you have the right to pollute the rivers [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4278.0599999999995s)]
*  and streams? [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4284.78s)]
*  That's a good question because these all have trickle-down effects. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4286.44s)]
*  That water is connected to other waterways. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4290.4s)]
*  And we should have better regulation. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4293.2s)]
*  We have gotten a lot better regulation. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4294.48s)]
*  But I was simply trying to get you a sense of when you do anything in the world, it has [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4295.88s)]
*  negative impacts and positive impacts. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4300.759999999999s)]
*  You're a glass half full guy. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4302.88s)]
*  No, I'm a glass that you need to- no, I can't carry on that metaphor. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4304.16s)]
*  Okay, you don't have to. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4308.84s)]
*  I put you down the dark road. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4310.2s)]
*  The idea behind it is there's a trade-off with everything you do. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4313.02s)]
*  That's what Thomas Sowell said that. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4316.74s)]
*  There's no solutions. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4318.5s)]
*  There's trade-offs. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4319.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4320.5s)]
*  And what again, we talked about what should we say to these guys that are gluing themselves [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4321.5s)]
*  on paintings. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4325.82s)]
*  And not only should you not be scared witless, you should think of this as a problem. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4327.86s)]
*  But then you also need to find out what actually works. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4332.34s)]
*  Remember, Germany has been half- Germany is for many people sort of these amazing green [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4335.34s)]
*  wonder land. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4341.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4342.4800000000005s)]
*  But no, they've gone from 84% fossil fuels to now 77% fossil fuels. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4343.4800000000005s)]
*  And they spent half a trillion dollars trying to achieve that. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4350.4800000000005s)]
*  That's not how you do these things. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4354.2s)]
*  That's not how you really show yourself to the world and say, we're really amazing. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4356.04s)]
*  Is that a political posturing thing where they put policies in place because those policies [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4359.8s)]
*  are what the people have been sort of at least programmed by fear mongering to expect and [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4365.76s)]
*  want from their politicians? [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4370.12s)]
*  It's partly that. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4371.62s)]
*  I mean, obviously it's good politics because a lot of people get reelected saying, I'm [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4372.62s)]
*  going to save your world and elect me and then I'm going to put up some more solar panels. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4376.42s)]
*  But the problem is, it's incredibly expensive way of achieving almost nothing. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4381.179999999999s)]
*  And that's why, if you look at what fracking has done, fracking is sort of a dirty word. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4386.28s)]
*  Do you work for big fracking? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4391.34s)]
*  No. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4392.34s)]
*  This son of a bitch works for big fracking. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4393.34s)]
*  But I simply point out that fracking more than anything else has cut carbon emissions [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4394.82s)]
*  dramatically because you've given an alternative to coal, which not only emits a lot of CO2, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4399.400000000001s)]
*  but also kills a lot of people through air pollution. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4405.32s)]
*  And you can now do a lot less. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4409.12s)]
*  Imagine if we could make China frack, India frack, Europe would be good to frack as well, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4411.2s)]
*  because we could actually get all of these countries to switch away from coal towards [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4417.04s)]
*  gas. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4421.360000000001s)]
*  Now, this is not the whole solution, but it has the beauty of being cheaper so that you [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4422.360000000001s)]
*  don't actually have to go to all these summits where everybody promises stuff and then don't [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4427.3s)]
*  do it. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4430.74s)]
*  But you would actually have people do what's in their own private interest. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4431.74s)]
*  But that's an uncomfortable trade off to me, this idea of exploiting the environment that [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4434.5s)]
*  way, because that's what it is. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4440.82s)]
*  It's like if you're going to agree to pollute a certain amount of the water, a certain amount [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4442.42s)]
*  of the land, is there any solution to extract that pollution? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4447.259999999999s)]
*  And is that even feasible or possible? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4451.62s)]
*  Of course. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4454.38s)]
*  I mean, look. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4455.38s)]
*  Because if it's not, I don't think that should even be considered. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4456.4800000000005s)]
*  I understand that our emissions are an important issue, but our emissions are where they are [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4459.08s)]
*  now. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4463.24s)]
*  For a trade off like that, where you decide you're going to do something that's going [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4464.24s)]
*  to definitely pollute rivers and streams, and to decide the way that you're going to [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4468.16s)]
*  do that because it's going to reduce the effect on the environment in terms of the emissions [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4473.56s)]
*  increase, there's got to be a better way. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4476.76s)]
*  So look, I think we need to go back. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4478.96s)]
*  I would love to look at the study again. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4481.72s)]
*  So the vast majority is air pollution. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4484.0s)]
*  That's simply just that you have elevated levels near the fracking. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4486.38s)]
*  This is pollution from fracking, air pollution. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4492.54s)]
*  So the water pollution, it's localized, and it's mostly the people who are also getting [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4494.9s)]
*  the benefits. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4500.3s)]
*  That's why many people would accept this sort of trade off. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4501.3s)]
*  Absolutely we should not have, you're sort of switching over to this other place where [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4506.5s)]
*  if it dramatically damaged rivers downstream and cultural place and all that stuff. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4510.98s)]
*  That's much more regulatable. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  That's the kind of thing where you just simply say you can't do this. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4519.86s)]
*  We had a lot of this impact in the early part of fracking where just everybody did it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4522.419999999999s)]
*  It was sort of a wild west for everything. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4526.94s)]
*  But you can regulate a lot of this, and that's why I think it's a fairly small part of it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4529.5s)]
*  Again, I don't- [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4533.419999999999s)]
*  How can you regulate unseen water pollution? [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4534.419999999999s)]
*  So the method that they utilize in fracking is they drill holes and then they force liquids [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4538.86s)]
*  into these holes. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4545.86s)]
*  These liquids are filled with chemicals and somehow now there's a process and they use [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4548.38s)]
*  that to extract it. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4551.42s)]
*  So how are they doing that and how could you possibly regulate that if you're not even [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4552.9800000000005s)]
*  seeing where it's going? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4556.7s)]
*  So the way you regulated it was to get rid of the most dangerous parts of those chemicals. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4558.86s)]
*  As I understand it, there's very little dangerous now, the chemicals that you put in, and then [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4563.58s)]
*  you can also have the overflow so you actually get the wastewater out and that you keep that [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4567.72s)]
*  or you treat that before you release it back. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4572.64s)]
*  Is that possible to do if they're pumping it into the earth? [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4575.84s)]
*  No, no, you pump it out again. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4578.360000000001s)]
*  You pump it out again. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4580.360000000001s)]
*  You're not leaving it down there. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4583.360000000001s)]
*  The pollution, that's also why it gets back into the environment. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4585.4800000000005s)]
*  The pollution typically came, the water pollution that you're thinking of, I think mostly came [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4588.68s)]
*  from- [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4592.84s)]
*  Surface? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4593.84s)]
*  Taking this wastewater when it comes back up again and then just letting it seep in, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4594.96s)]
*  putting it in places where it wasn't quite, where if it rained a lot it would just overflow [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4601.2s)]
*  or that kind of thing. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4605.56s)]
*  This is something that we know very well how to do. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4607.52s)]
*  If you have, yes, there are always people who will cheat and stuff. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4609.92s)]
*  That's why you need some sort of follow up as well and you probably also want to have [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4613.4400000000005s)]
*  bigger companies doing this because they follow standard procedure. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4618.68s)]
*  This is fairly simple to manage, if you will. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4622.72s)]
*  That's what the EPA does in a lot of different- [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4626.52s)]
*  Did you ever see the documentary Gasland? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4628.52s)]
*  What did you think about that documentary? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4631.88s)]
*  My two cents in that was that it's a good thing to point out that there's a real issue [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4634.92s)]
*  here when you contrast it with what most of the actual operators said were the problems. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4640.84s)]
*  I think it was somewhat misleading and it was certainly alarmist. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4649.0s)]
*  But again, I think it's good that we get these stories out there, but we need to keep a sense [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4653.44s)]
*  of perspective. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4658.56s)]
*  What about the people whose water was on fire? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4659.56s)]
*  And it was a great picture. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4662.28s)]
*  And very clearly there were some of these things that needed to get regulated and they [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4666.52s)]
*  now have. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4671.4s)]
*  They have? [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4672.48s)]
*  They fixed it? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4673.48s)]
*  It's all done? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4674.48s)]
*  All better? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4675.48s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a lot better. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4676.48s)]
*  The Environmental Defense Fund and many others are saying as well. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4677.959999999999s)]
*  Do you know what the chemicals were that were really dangerous that they were using that [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4680.959999999999s)]
*  they stopped using? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4684.16s)]
*  No. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4685.16s)]
*  I kind of know. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4686.16s)]
*  I've read it, but I can't remember. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4687.16s)]
*  So there's no damage whatsoever to the waterways that are under the ground if they're pumping [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4689.16s)]
*  all this toxic chemicals in there? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4693.879999999999s)]
*  No, because they're pumping way further down than where aquifers typically are. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4696.4s)]
*  And they pump them into places that have held hydrocarbons. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4701.24s)]
*  That's why they're there for millions of years. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4705.32s)]
*  So they can extract basically everything they put down there. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4708.28s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4712.88s)]
*  Well, that's better. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4713.88s)]
*  But this idea that we should accept some amount of water pollution and river pollution scares [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4715.32s)]
*  the shit out of me because that's like one of the few amazing things about this country [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4719.74s)]
*  is that there are still unspoiled natural habitats and to fuck those up in the name [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4725.08s)]
*  of the economy. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4732.2s)]
*  I think, and I get that point, I think you're sort of imagining that we're going to frack [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4733.2s)]
*  and then Yellowstone goes down and flames kind of thing. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4738.76s)]
*  No, I'm saying even for local areas, imagine if you're a person who like your family's [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4742.36s)]
*  always gone down to this river. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4747.5199999999995s)]
*  It's near your house and it's a source of recreation for everybody. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4749.48s)]
*  Now you can't go in there because it's polluted. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4752.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4754.36s)]
*  So again, I don't know this well enough, but it's not my understanding that we're anywhere [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4755.36s)]
*  near that situation. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4760.22s)]
*  It would be something that you could measure elevated levels of some constituents. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4762.18s)]
*  That would be it. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4766.14s)]
*  See if you can Google what the, there was one river that I think that they were talking [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4768.22s)]
*  about in that documentary that got polluted directly because of fracking and the chemicals [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4772.860000000001s)]
*  released from fracking and then it was really damaging. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4779.18s)]
*  That scares the shit out of people when they start talking about extracting oil near like [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4783.740000000001s)]
*  where salmon spawn and stuff like that. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4787.38s)]
*  That, I mean, we've got to be really careful about doing stuff like that just to boost [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4790.799999999999s)]
*  the economy. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4794.82s)]
*  That seems like a short-sighted thing that's going to cost us more money in the long run [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4795.82s)]
*  if ultimately does lead to be not just more money, but like you're going to have these [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4800.0199999999995s)]
*  unfixable areas of pollution. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4804.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4806.58s)]
*  I think this is way exaggerated. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4807.58s)]
*  The point that I try to make was when you do these estimates, and that's why I think [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4812.5199999999995s)]
*  that the academics actually have a good sort of contribution. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4818.18s)]
*  They tell you that when you look at all the disbenefits from fracking, those are significant. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4820.9800000000005s)]
*  There's a net positive. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4826.62s)]
*  That's $25 billion. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4828.3s)]
*  That means that there will be some people who will be more exposed to air pollution [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4830.14s)]
*  which will lead to some diseases. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4834.64s)]
*  And that's the net worth of which is in the order of $25 billion. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4837.26s)]
*  It's a lot of other things and also some of these waterway things. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4841.22s)]
*  So that's people that are working on the fracking mines and then working in the... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4843.54s)]
*  It could also be just people who are there, who live there. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4847.58s)]
*  Well, that sucks if you're there and you... [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4850.14s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4851.7s)]
*  You don't frack. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4852.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4853.7s)]
*  And you have to... [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4854.7s)]
*  And, you know, but I think if you look at any other thing, so if you look at the fact [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4855.7s)]
*  that we have roads in the US, they kill 40,000 people every year. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4859.74s)]
*  You mean car accidents? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4864.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4865.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4866.74s)]
*  And, you know, there's a very simple way to avoid that. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4867.74s)]
*  It's setting the speed limit at three miles an hour. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4870.38s)]
*  Mm, good call. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4873.0199999999995s)]
*  And we make that trade-off and we say, look, you can have a sensible conversation should [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4875.22s)]
*  it be 55 or 75. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4879.26s)]
*  And that's a real conversation about how much faster do I get home versus how many more [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4880.740000000001s)]
*  people die. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4885.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4886.46s)]
*  But none of us would be willing to say it's going to be three miles an hour. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4887.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4890.740000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the conversation that we need to have. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4891.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of a different conversation. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4893.740000000001s)]
*  I'm seeing... [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4896.1s)]
*  Delaware's rivers and streams are the most polluted in the US, a new report says. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4897.1s)]
*  And is this directly because of fracking? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4901.34s)]
*  That's what I was trying to figure out. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4902.9400000000005s)]
*  So I just found another article that kind of contradicts that specifically and said [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4904.14s)]
*  it's particular right here. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4907.14s)]
*  So it's been cleaned up and it's now today like one of the top water quality success [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4910.5s)]
*  stories. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4915.18s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4916.18s)]
*  When was the other article written? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4917.18s)]
*  This is from New Jersey.gov and the other one was also this year. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4918.18s)]
*  It's a report from another, like PBS, so News Station wrote this and this is also from this [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4922.02s)]
*  year. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4926.900000000001s)]
*  So which one is saying... [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4927.900000000001s)]
*  This is where you got to... [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4928.900000000001s)]
*  So can I just say... [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4930.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4931.38s)]
*  You get this a lot. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4932.38s)]
*  So it's not just this particular thing, but what we know is that all pollution levels [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4933.38s)]
*  have been going down in the US. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4937.5s)]
*  So it could actually both be true that everything is getting cleaner, but Delaware's rivers [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4939.46s)]
*  are getting less more clean. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4944.06s)]
*  Do you see what I mean? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4946.3s)]
*  They're getting cleaner slower. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4948.06s)]
*  Cleaner slower. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4949.62s)]
*  So even though it's one of the most polluted, it's one of the most polluted in comparison [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4950.62s)]
*  with all the other very, very clean rivers. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4955.54s)]
*  And again, this is not untrue. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4958.14s)]
*  And certainly we want our environment to be cleaner rather than dirtier. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4960.3s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4964.58s)]
*  But it's just that we can't have this idea of saying we won't accept any damage anywhere [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4966.18s)]
*  because then we end up, and this of course is what happens in many areas, we end up sending [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4971.58s)]
*  all our pollution to China and India and elsewhere and feel all virtuous about it. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4977.06s)]
*  We do? [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4981.7s)]
*  How do we do that? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4982.7s)]
*  So there's a good chance... [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4983.7s)]
*  No, you have a Tesla, right? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4985.54s)]
*  So that's possibly produced here. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4987.02s)]
*  But most electric cars, their batteries are produced in China. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4988.9s)]
*  So all the pollution went in over in China and then we drive around and feel virtuous [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4992.98s)]
*  about them. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4998.0599999999995s)]
*  You mean involved in the construction of the cars? [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=4999.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5001.74s)]
*  And of course that's true for everything else. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5002.74s)]
*  Most of the stuff... [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5004.219999999999s)]
*  I don't know how much of the stuff in here, but probably a lot of it is from China. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5005.219999999999s)]
*  And just like everyone else, it's not you. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5010.339999999999s)]
*  There's anything wrong with... [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5013.299999999999s)]
*  But that's just how we put up our world. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5014.58s)]
*  So we actually can feel very virtuous about ourselves and make everything cleaner, but [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5017.58s)]
*  then just have the air pollution and all the other pollution impacts somewhere else. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5021.9s)]
*  Now when you look at the overall landscape of proposed improvements and the impact that [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5026.7s)]
*  will have on the environment, what stands out to you? [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5034.98s)]
*  What do you think is things that people are talking about in terms of helping the environment [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5037.0599999999995s)]
*  and reducing our carbon footprint? [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5043.42s)]
*  What makes sense? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5045.62s)]
*  So I'll tell you one thing that does know, then one thing that does. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5047.16s)]
*  So if you look at a lot of these things, oh, I'm not going to do this or I'm not going [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5050.599999999999s)]
*  to do that. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5055.16s)]
*  I'm actually a vegetarian. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5056.16s)]
*  How dare you. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5057.16s)]
*  Yes, sorry about that. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5058.16s)]
*  I knew it. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5059.16s)]
*  Moral choice. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5060.16s)]
*  Works for big fracking and he's a vegetarian. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5061.16s)]
*  This fucking guy. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5063.5599999999995s)]
*  People will tell you that going vegetarian is a great thing for the planet, but actually [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5066.44s)]
*  it's a fairly small impact overall. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5072.32s)]
*  So they'll tell you that it'll reduce your carbon footprint by 50 percent. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5075.44s)]
*  What they don't tell you, it's your food footprint, which is a very small part of your [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5079.32s)]
*  total impact. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5085.48s)]
*  So we're talking about 4 percent or thereabouts. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5086.48s)]
*  And then remember also being vegetarian is cheaper. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5088.919999999999s)]
*  So that actually means you have more money and you're going to spend that on a trip to [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5091.78s)]
*  Mexico or something. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5095.9s)]
*  So it actually turns out that when you take into account that people are going to spend [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5097.419999999999s)]
*  on something else, it probably reduces your emissions by 2 percent. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5101.280000000001s)]
*  When people talk about emissions and vegetarianism, do they take into account the difference in [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5105.64s)]
*  monocrop agriculture versus regenerative agriculture? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5110.52s)]
*  You can buy food. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5114.280000000001s)]
*  We had Will Harris from White Oak Pastures and who has this very sophisticated regenerative [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5116.280000000001s)]
*  farm that he converted his family's industrialized farm over a period of 20 years. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5121.080000000001s)]
*  Amazing story. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5126.860000000001s)]
*  Really interesting guy. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5127.860000000001s)]
*  But doing so has basically they take out more carbon than they put out in the environment. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5129.12s)]
*  Everything is natural. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5136.04s)]
*  They don't use any pesticides or herbicides. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5137.04s)]
*  Everything is done the way nature intended. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5139.5599999999995s)]
*  They've essentially recreated nature in a controlled environment in terms of utilizing [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5142.84s)]
*  the manure and the chicken shit and the chickens roam around and the pigs root around and all [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5148.0s)]
*  these animals live as if they're supposed to live, like normally in the wild. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5153.96s)]
*  Because of that, his water that runs off into the river is so noticeably different than [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5158.92s)]
*  the water of his next door neighbor. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5164.16s)]
*  It's stunning. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5166.12s)]
*  His next door neighbor runs a traditional industrialized farm and when you see their [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5167.360000000001s)]
*  property line, when the water runs off, his is clear and then it hits where the neighbor's [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5171.92s)]
*  property is and it turns brown instantly. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5177.52s)]
*  There's a literal divide line in the river. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5180.2s)]
*  It's crazy to see. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5183.320000000001s)]
*  So that's something you have to take into account when you think about vegetarianism. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5184.7s)]
*  How are you getting your vegetables? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5189.22s)]
*  Are you getting it from a place like White Oaks Pastures that raises everything in a [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5191.46s)]
*  regenerative way so it's natural, there's no pesticides or herbicides, no poison at [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5195.38s)]
*  all is getting leaked into the water supply? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5199.86s)]
*  Or are you buying your vegetables at a regular supermarket and they're, oh, it's corn, great, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5203.0599999999995s)]
*  corn's good for you. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5208.82s)]
*  But meanwhile, you're contributing to this fucking crazy eco devastation on this river [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5209.94s)]
*  and you don't even think you are. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5214.62s)]
*  So the numbers I showed you were the ones that are based on how we actually produce [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5217.139999999999s)]
*  and that's by far mostly what that other guy does. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5221.7s)]
*  By far mostly doing it industrialized. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5225.259999999999s)]
*  So you have to be a little careful though. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5227.58s)]
*  So a lot of farms that say, for instance, they're organic and they don't use pesticides [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5230.9s)]
*  and they don't use artificial fertilizer and all that stuff, they basically get a lot of [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5235.98s)]
*  their fertilizer from other farms that are not because otherwise you can't make it run [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5241.179999999999s)]
*  around. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5246.139999999999s)]
*  A curious thing that I think most people don't recognize. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5247.139999999999s)]
*  Say that again? [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5250.62s)]
*  So there's not enough natural fertilizer in the world to keep eight billion people fed. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5251.62s)]
*  There's actually only enough natural fertilizer to keep four billion people fed. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5258.099999999999s)]
*  But isn't that under current farming models? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5262.9s)]
*  Well, it's just simply a question of nitrogen. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5265.7s)]
*  There's just not enough nitrogen in the world to make it run around. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5268.82s)]
*  That's why you have to have the other four billion people or half of every person fed [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5272.5s)]
*  with fertilizer that basically comes from natural gas. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5278.5s)]
*  And so when people say, oh, I have this very, very nice environmental farm, it often means [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5284.78s)]
*  that they're actually importing basically feces from other farms that have been grown [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5290.5s)]
*  with artificial fertilizer. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5296.26s)]
*  I don't necessarily think he does that. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5298.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5301.26s)]
*  But it's not that big of a farm in terms of like the amount of humans. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5302.26s)]
*  Do you remember what he said? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5307.7s)]
*  Like the amount of humans he could feed with his farm? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5308.7s)]
*  It's not enormous. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5312.5s)]
*  No. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5313.5s)]
*  And the point is we just can't make this happen for everyone, which is one of the things that [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5314.5s)]
*  people go by organic and all that stuff. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5319.46s)]
*  It's great because it makes people feel really virtuous. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5321.9400000000005s)]
*  But the point is we just couldn't do it all of us. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5326.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5328.26s)]
*  But for the humans that do it, they are having a smaller impact, which is doing something [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5329.26s)]
*  to make them feel better. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5335.54s)]
*  It certainly is. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5336.54s)]
*  You really are buying food from white oaks pastures. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5337.54s)]
*  That's your sole source of food for your family. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5340.74s)]
*  You 100% are contributing less to the carbon footprint in comparison to buying stuff from [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5343.34s)]
*  that farm that's leaking into the river. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5349.18s)]
*  No, not that. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5351.06s)]
*  Well, it depends on whether you're talking about the carbon footprint, not the carbon [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5352.06s)]
*  footprint. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5355.62s)]
*  They typically emit about as much organic farms. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5356.62s)]
*  Again, I don't know this particular farm. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5360.3s)]
*  How is that possible though? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5362.34s)]
*  Because they're much less effective. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5364.9800000000005s)]
*  And so they use a lot more land to produce the same amount of food. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5366.900000000001s)]
*  And so what is the carbon footprint coming from machines that they use? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5370.740000000001s)]
*  Well, it both comes from the methane that leaks from the land, from the inputs that [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5373.86s)]
*  go into the individual animals. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5380.86s)]
*  It depends also a lot on what kind of animals it is and what kind of grains or whatever [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5384.38s)]
*  it is that you're producing. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5389.38s)]
*  But the point is that overall when you do these life cycle analyses, you get that they [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5391.179999999999s)]
*  have about the same impact per pound of food. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5395.46s)]
*  Really even the regenerative farm? [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5400.42s)]
*  Well again, I don't know this. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5402.259999999999s)]
*  I think the way he was describing it, he was very proud of the fact that it's essentially [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5404.3s)]
*  below carbon neutral. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5410.0199999999995s)]
*  That it's actually taking out carbon from the way they grow their food to the way they [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5412.22s)]
*  utilize the manure and the way they feed the animals. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5418.42s)]
*  That's impressive because you can't, and again I don't know how you do that because you can [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5422.9s)]
*  certainly set some land aside and make sure you generate more and more carbon in that [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5428.14s)]
*  storage area for a while, but you can't keep doing that. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5433.1s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5437.46s)]
*  As a result, white oak pastures has a carbon footprint 111% lower than conventional beef. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5438.46s)]
*  White oak pastures sequestered 919 tons of CO2 in the soil with the help of plants and [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5446.06s)]
*  compost. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5453.580000000001s)]
*  That's like switching 31,679 incandescent light bulbs to LED. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5456.46s)]
*  It shows white oak pastures versus other proteins, like how they're grown in other places. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5461.94s)]
*  You see conventional beef, which is a huge amount of carbon, plus 33. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5467.9s)]
*  White oak pastures, it gets to them, their beef is negative 3.5. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5472.86s)]
*  The only way that you can sequester CO2 and land is by not having it be productive. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5478.94s)]
*  You need to have it, you need to basically have it build up carbon dioxide in the, sorry, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5485.06s)]
*  carbon in the... [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5492.34s)]
*  But he's talking about compost and manure extracting that. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5493.34s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't use it because if you use it then you emit it again. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5496.22s)]
*  We store more carbon in the soil than our cows emit during their lives. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5499.9800000000005s)]
*  So pounds of CO2 for every pound of white oak pastures be produced. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5505.06s)]
*  This seems to contradict what you're saying. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5509.18s)]
*  Look, I don't know how this works. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5512.5s)]
*  I'm talking about how regular organic farms work and there's been lots of studies done [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5515.82s)]
*  on that. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5520.9s)]
*  And the thing I'm a little worried about here is that it doesn't seem reasonable to me that [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5521.9s)]
*  you can actually keep this up. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5526.86s)]
*  You can certainly do it for a few short years where you build up your carbon storage in [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5528.86s)]
*  your land, but eventually you have to either use it productively or keep it fenced off. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5535.42s)]
*  I don't understand what you're saying. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5541.86s)]
*  Why would he have to do that if he's rotating the crops and rotating where the animals go [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5542.86s)]
*  and moving them around? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5547.099999999999s)]
*  So if you plant a forest, so that's the typical sort of way you think about this. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5549.82s)]
*  You put up a forest, you put up small saplings, they grow bigger and bigger, they store a [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5555.0199999999995s)]
*  lot of carbon. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5559.5s)]
*  They both store it in the crown but also in the root material. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5560.5s)]
*  But eventually they've grown full and then they can't store anymore and then you just [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5563.46s)]
*  have to keep it there. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5567.099999999999s)]
*  If you cut them down then obviously you now release all the CO2 again. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5569.06s)]
*  And what they're doing, as I understand it, is they're basically building it up in their [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5573.18s)]
*  ground so they're having more roots in there, more stuff in there. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5576.700000000001s)]
*  But if you don't release it, if you don't use it, if you don't grow on it, you have [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5580.740000000001s)]
*  to keep not growing on it in order to keep it stored away. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5586.46s)]
*  Well they're growing, it's pastures, so they have grass growing there. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5590.54s)]
*  That's like the main thing that these cows are eating. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5595.9400000000005s)]
*  They're all grass fed. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5599.34s)]
*  No, I get that. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5600.54s)]
*  So that's how they're doing it. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5601.9s)]
*  Okay, yeah, no that makes sense. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5603.38s)]
*  Sorry, I was thinking about intensive farm. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5604.66s)]
*  Yeah, no that makes sense. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5607.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so his method, I think the only knock on it would be if you want to have a jack [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5609.42s)]
*  in the box on every corner and you want cheap beef to feed people everywhere, you probably [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5614.42s)]
*  can't do it that way. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5619.42s)]
*  And if you want to feed everyone. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5620.78s)]
*  But his argument was that we really shouldn't be eating that way anyway. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5622.62s)]
*  That's also a fair point. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5627.26s)]
*  So the main point comes back to saying we can't do this for everyone. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5628.820000000001s)]
*  And that was the main point I was trying to make, that we have this idea of saying we [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5634.66s)]
*  can all go organic. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5638.820000000001s)]
*  No, a few people can go organic and feel very comfortable about it, but there's just not [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5640.22s)]
*  enough nitrogen for everyone to do this. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5644.26s)]
*  And so that was the answer that I wanted to say. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5647.42s)]
*  Don't think that these sort of cheap, simple things where you vert your signal is how you're [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5650.5s)]
*  really going to switch. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5656.34s)]
*  The way you're going to switch, the way we're actually going to fix climate change is by [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5657.88s)]
*  focusing on technology. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5662.38s)]
*  So you mentioned one of them, nuclear. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5664.12s)]
*  If we could imagine that we could actually get fourth generation nuclear in some way [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5666.62s)]
*  to be incredibly cheap and safe, that could solve a very large part of it. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5670.56s)]
*  Imagine if you come up with a technology that's cheaper than coal and gas and all that. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5675.3s)]
*  Everyone is going to switch, not just because they're rich, well-meaning Americans, but [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5680.96s)]
*  also the Chinese, the Indians, the Africans, everybody else. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5685.24s)]
*  So that will basically generate a lot of cheap energy that's both good for economic growth [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5688.5599999999995s)]
*  and will cut carbon emissions dramatically. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5694.08s)]
*  Now, remember, this is not the only thing you need because you can't just run, well, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5696.12s)]
*  you possibly can run most of the world on electricity, but we don't right now. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5700.6s)]
*  Right now, only about 20% is electricity. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5704.64s)]
*  The rest of energy is industrial processes, heating, transport, all these other things [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5708.62s)]
*  that are much, much harder to switch out. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5713.88s)]
*  So obviously also steel and cement and so on. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5716.88s)]
*  So there's a lot of issues that still remain, but the technology point still remains. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5722.360000000001s)]
*  If we can come up with this technology that's cheaper than fossil fuels and does not emit [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5727.52s)]
*  CO2, we're done. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5732.12s)]
*  Now, if we don't do this and if we give in to climate fear, which is what a lot of people [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5733.4400000000005s)]
*  are using, it seems, if you want to be cynical, it seems like a political ploy. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5741.48s)]
*  Why would they want to do that? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5746.48s)]
*  What do you think the motivation is of not having a balanced, nuanced perspective and [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5747.48s)]
*  expressing a balanced, nuanced perspective to people? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5753.12s)]
*  Or you could explain things the way you're explaining them. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5756.36s)]
*  There's an economic impact to this. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5758.96s)]
*  There's a trade-off to that. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5760.44s)]
*  Here's why it's better for, actually better for the atmosphere overall if we do it this [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5762.08s)]
*  way. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5766.12s)]
*  The solution seems to be in technology and it's not in halting all use of fossil fuels [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5767.8s)]
*  immediately, which would be devastating to the economy. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5773.0s)]
*  And ultimately when the economy goes, it's devastating to almost all aspects of our civilization. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5775.44s)]
*  That's the very unfortunate reality of life. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5781.12s)]
*  So have you ever had a debate with someone about this? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5784.12s)]
*  Oh, gosh, yes. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5787.5599999999995s)]
*  Is it climate fanatic? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5788.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5789.5599999999995s)]
*  I have lots of those debates. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5790.5599999999995s)]
*  How do those go? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5791.5599999999995s)]
*  My sense is that these guys are really well-intentioned. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5792.8s)]
*  So they really want to do good. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5796.400000000001s)]
*  It's not sort of an evil ploy or anything, but they seem to believe that just by wishing [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5799.320000000001s)]
*  we can somehow make it come true. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5805.68s)]
*  And I think a lot of the conversation that, so when you're starting to see what is it [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5808.4400000000005s)]
*  going to cost to go net zero, for instance, a lot of people are talking about we should [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5813.120000000001s)]
*  go net zero. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5816.92s)]
*  You know, Biden, President Biden is talking about that. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5817.92s)]
*  This will be fantastically costly. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5821.72s)]
*  And that's what all these studies show. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5823.88s)]
*  So McKinsey shows it's going to cost nearly $6 trillion every year for the world. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5825.360000000001s)]
*  That's two thirds of the total global tax intake. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5830.84s)]
*  So basically imagine that two thirds of everything the U.S. government spends now would have [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5833.72s)]
*  to go to net zero. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5839.04s)]
*  Well, I think you said something that's very important, too. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5840.04s)]
*  You said the world. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5842.04s)]
*  And I think it's very unreasonable to assume that the rest of the world would take on this [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5843.6s)]
*  economic burden the way we're willing to take it on for the environment. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5849.24s)]
*  And that, in fact, there are countries that are not interested at all in releasing less [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5853.16s)]
*  carbon. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5857.88s)]
*  They're interested in economically becoming more and more powerful and spreading their [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5858.88s)]
*  wings. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5862.76s)]
*  And just lifting their populations out of poverty. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5863.76s)]
*  And also becoming more military, you know, more powerful. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5867.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5871.24s)]
*  Look, China is not just a good guy nation by any means, but I can understand them and [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5872.24s)]
*  I can understand why India and Africa wants to be a little bit like China. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5878.16s)]
*  Remember, China has basically lifted what almost a billion people out of poverty. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5883.12s)]
*  That's an amazing achievement. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5886.84s)]
*  And if you lived in China or you lived in India, you would want to do the same. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5888.48s)]
*  Sure. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5892.5199999999995s)]
*  But then at what cost? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5893.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5895.32s)]
*  And so the reality is even if just the U.S. tried to go net zero, there's a new study [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5896.32s)]
*  in Nature magazine that estimated that the cost per person, I actually have that graph [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5902.72s)]
*  so we can we can show that as well. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5907.68s)]
*  So the cost per person would be phenomenal. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5910.64s)]
*  It would be nice if I could find it. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5913.200000000001s)]
*  But oh, there it is. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5917.64s)]
*  So it's number 28A. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5919.0s)]
*  So the cost of reducing emissions, 80 percent. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5925.240000000001s)]
*  This is per person per year in the U.S. by mid-century. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5929.88s)]
*  Eleven thousand bucks. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5933.160000000001s)]
*  That's that's almost entire net zero. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5934.32s)]
*  And the the the modelers say they're not sure whether this is true, but it's certainly a [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5937.2s)]
*  big number. But even if you just went 80 percent towards the Biden promise, it would cost more [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5941.0s)]
*  than five thousand dollars per person per year. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5947.0s)]
*  Just get Bill Gates to me for it. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5950.04s)]
*  I don't get it. What's the problem? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5952.16s)]
*  I got a lot of money. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5953.36s)]
*  Get his wife. She's very philanthropically inclined. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5954.88s)]
*  Half a year. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5957.96s)]
*  Mackenzie Bezos. She's got a lot of cheddar. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5958.84s)]
*  She's putting in towards good use. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5961.08s)]
*  But the fundamental point is people are just not going to be willing to pay that amount of money. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5962.92s)]
*  Well, they might be. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5966.719999999999s)]
*  I mean, they might assume that the government could foot the bill for this. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5967.92s)]
*  If they can come up with so much money to send arms to Ukraine and to invade other countries [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5971.16s)]
*  and do a lot of shady shit that we don't appreciate them doing, we would think that they could [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5975.84s)]
*  fork out eleven thousand per person. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5979.599999999999s)]
*  And per year per year and crank that up. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5981.92s)]
*  What is that? What is that all told with three hundred and how many do we have now? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5984.96s)]
*  So this is a thirty twelve percent of US GDP. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5990.12s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah, that's a chunk. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5995.24s)]
*  Yes. So that's not feasible. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=5997.88s)]
*  Not currently. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6000.799999999999s)]
*  But we can work towards something like that. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6002.0s)]
*  That's why we need to get realistic and say we're not going to do this by telling everyone [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6005.32s)]
*  you have to pay up right now. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6010.799999999999s)]
*  How much we can do is to do this innovation. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6012.32s)]
*  We should be spending lots, lots more into innovation because innovation is incredibly [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6014.84s)]
*  cheap. So Craig Venture, do you remember him? [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6020.2s)]
*  He was the guy who cracked the human genome back in 2000. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6023.16s)]
*  He's sort of a crazy smart guy. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6026.92s)]
*  And he has this idea that he wants to grow algae, specific special algae on the ocean [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6030.320000000001s)]
*  surface that basically soak up sunlight and CO2 and produce oil. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6037.400000000001s)]
*  Imagine that we could grow our own Saudi Arabia is out on the ocean surface and then we [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6042.36s)]
*  just simply harvest those. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6047.5199999999995s)]
*  We process them, make oil. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6049.0s)]
*  We could keep our entire fossil fuel economy going right now. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6051.0s)]
*  But it would be CO2 neutral because they just soaked out the CO2 out in the ocean. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6054.36s)]
*  Would that have a detrimental effect on the ocean? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6058.839999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm sure that, you know, just like we've talked about before, nothing you do [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6062.04s)]
*  would have no impact. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6066.799999999999s)]
*  Most tradeoffs. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6069.04s)]
*  Yes, everything is tradeoffs. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6070.08s)]
*  But we could potentially solve a very large part of the global warming problem at fairly [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6071.8s)]
*  low cost. We can't do it right now because right now it costs a fortune and can't really [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6078.84s)]
*  be scaled very well. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6084.2s)]
*  But the point is, give this guy some money and try to investigate it because research [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6085.48s)]
*  is incredibly cheap. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6090.68s)]
*  This is how we've solved all problems. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6091.88s)]
*  If you think, you know, do you remember those Live Aid concerts and all that stuff? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6093.72s)]
*  Sure. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6097.04s)]
*  And even before then, we worried a lot about, you know, Africa, and it was especially India [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6097.36s)]
*  and Southeast Asia, not being able to feed their own populations. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6102.16s)]
*  And sort of the standard way that we think about global warming now is to tell everyone, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6105.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, could you not eat so much? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6109.719999999999s)]
*  And then we'll send it down to, you know, the poor Indians and the poor Africans. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6111.48s)]
*  And of course, that didn't work. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6115.0s)]
*  What did work was the Green Revolution. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6116.5199999999995s)]
*  We basically evolved these. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6118.92s)]
*  We innovated these new seeds that produce two or three times as much per acre. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6120.639999999999s)]
*  And that's what basically grew the world's population. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6125.4400000000005s)]
*  Sorry, the world's food production dramatically. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6128.6s)]
*  India is now one of the world's. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6131.0s)]
*  It is actually the world's leading rice exporter. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6132.92s)]
*  It's gone from a basket case to being able to feed its own population. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6135.72s)]
*  Aren't there a lot of problems with that, too, where the Indian farmers are getting [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6138.76s)]
*  fucked over and they get connected to these seeds that they don't own and they can't [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6142.92s)]
*  reuse and they owe a giant amount of money to the companies that provide them with the [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6148.16s)]
*  seeds? There's certainly some of that. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6153.28s)]
*  And there's a ton of suicides from these Indian farmers. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6154.719999999999s)]
*  So that's a pretty big trade off. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6159.16s)]
*  So, well, it actually turns out that there's less. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6160.48s)]
*  So there's there's IFPRI, who's one of these institutions that look into farmers and [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6163.12s)]
*  farming policy. They did an estimate and found that there are fewer people die from [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6169.92s)]
*  suicides. But because there's a lot of farmers in India, there's a lot of farmer [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6174.96s)]
*  suicides. But yes, there are absolutely problems in India as well. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6179.6s)]
*  But, you know, fundamentally being enthralled to big agro business because you have to [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6184.92s)]
*  buy more of the seeds or you have to pay more is probably a lot better than, you know, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6192.0s)]
*  dying from from not having enough food. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6197.400000000001s)]
*  But are they the only two solutions? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6200.280000000001s)]
*  No, no. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6201.72s)]
*  Isn't there a solution where they have a more equitable sort of relationship with the [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6202.400000000001s)]
*  people that provide them seeds and that they can both benefit from it? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6208.2s)]
*  Seems like they're getting exploited, right? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6211.8s)]
*  So, again, my my my understanding of this is that you can if you if you want to, you [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6214.4s)]
*  can buy the public seeds. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6220.96s)]
*  And so India and many other countries provide public seeds that don't have any [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6224.0s)]
*  copyright and that you can grow or you can buy the private property seeds that grow [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6229.04s)]
*  more per acre. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6235.16s)]
*  And so it's you know, it's basically a trade off just like when you go to a store and [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6237.16s)]
*  decide between a slightly less good product, which is cheaper and or a more expensive [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6242.08s)]
*  product. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6247.0s)]
*  It sounds like a creepy trade off, though, if the stuff that doesn't work as well is [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6247.5199999999995s)]
*  the stuff that you could get from the state. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6252.2s)]
*  And people are economically poor and disenfranchised. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6254.36s)]
*  And, you know, they have to take on loans to get the other seeds and they get indebted. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6258.839999999999s)]
*  Well, they don't have to get those seeds. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6262.799999999999s)]
*  Right. They can get the public seeds, but they won't be able to make it. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6264.32s)]
*  Well, they can't make it as much. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6267.2s)]
*  No. Right. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6268.88s)]
*  No. The point is barely getting by as it is, though, don't you think? [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6269.88s)]
*  So the problem is, I think we're seeing the outcome here from the people who [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6273.639999999999s)]
*  basically said, all right, I'm going to get a loan, possibly from a loan shark, and [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6278.96s)]
*  then invest this in order to get a higher payoff. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6284.24s)]
*  If it works out, if it's beautiful, if it was great weather, it works out really [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6288.599999999999s)]
*  well. If it didn't, I'm screwed and then I commit suicide. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6292.16s)]
*  I'm making a story here. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6295.2s)]
*  But the idea here is still that, you know, it's possibly not the right way to think [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6296.5599999999995s)]
*  about this if we're just concerned about, well, you know, the people who took chances [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6302.599999999999s)]
*  shouldn't have been so exposed if they made the wrong choices. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6307.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I think what we're really concerned with is predatory relationships between very [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6313.88s)]
*  poor farmers and giant multinational corporations that don't give a fuck about those [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6318.48s)]
*  people. That's what scares us. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6322.719999999999s)]
*  That, you know, there's a dehumanizing aspect to this sort of method of producing [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6324.879999999999s)]
*  agriculture. Yeah. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6330.4s)]
*  So the real issue here is, though, that most of the of the big agricultural producers [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6331.799999999999s)]
*  basically produce for rich countries because those are the ones who can pay. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6339.799999999999s)]
*  So what we're stuck with and very often don't have very good is that we need much more [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6343.839999999999s)]
*  research into getting yield enhancement in the things that you grow in many of the poor [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6349.08s)]
*  countries in the world that are also better suited for their agriculture. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6355.2s)]
*  This is a lot of what, for instance, research goes into and where we should be spending [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6358.96s)]
*  a lot more money. So I totally agree that we can do it even better. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6363.04s)]
*  But I just think we need to step back and also realize we have managed to make the world [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6366.839999999999s)]
*  and India and Africa a lot better off, which is why a lot fewer people are starving. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6371.5199999999995s)]
*  Again, you're a glass half full guy. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6376.32s)]
*  I'm a guy where it says we used to have what, seven million kids dying each year of [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6378.48s)]
*  malnutrition. Now it's less than three. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6384.679999999999s)]
*  That still means there's almost three million kids that die each year from malnutrition. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6386.679999999999s)]
*  That's terrible. But it's a much better world than seven. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6391.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. And that's a weird conversation to have with people because all people want to [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6394.5199999999995s)]
*  think about generally is the negative aspects of any story. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6400.8s)]
*  They always want to do that. And this is a big story that affects the whole world. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6404.280000000001s)]
*  I was going to ask you in the middle of all that. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6407.64s)]
*  I didn't want to forget what percentage of the CO2 emission, the greenhouse gases does [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6409.96s)]
*  the United States produce in relationship to the rest of the world? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6415.96s)]
*  What does the rest of the world produce? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6419.04s)]
*  So it's about 12 percent. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6421.04s)]
*  We produce 12 percent. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6423.360000000001s)]
*  So if we cut back to net zero, you're still dealing with an 88 percent problem. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6424.96s)]
*  Yes. And we just to give you a sense of proportion, if you actually take out the U.S. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6429.4s)]
*  emissions from the UN climate model, it turns out that by the end of the century you'll [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6434.759999999999s)]
*  have zero point three degree Fahrenheit lower temperatures. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6440.04s)]
*  So you'll have this temperature increase instead of this temperature increase. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6443.48s)]
*  So the temperature will continue to increase. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6447.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. But slightly less. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6449.48s)]
*  Do they really have an objective understanding of how much of this is a natural cycle and [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6451.28s)]
*  how much of this is being caused by human beings? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6456.88s)]
*  Do they have like can they like quantify it? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6460.84s)]
*  So we started out talking a little bit about what what do they think it is. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6463.6s)]
*  And again, my understanding is that they're saying it's a very large part is predominant [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6467.92s)]
*  part that's caused by global warming. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6472.24s)]
*  But it's also obvious that we have less good understanding of these long term cycles. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6474.0s)]
*  So there is some of that concern. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6478.92s)]
*  But fundamentally, I think you can sort of step back and say global warming is real. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6481.04s)]
*  It is made by man. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6485.28s)]
*  It is a problem that we're making. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6486.5599999999995s)]
*  It's not the end of the world. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6488.32s)]
*  And we need to deal with it, but deal with it smartly. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6490.08s)]
*  Right. So instead of us gluing ourselves to pictures and saying we've got to stop [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6492.5599999999995s)]
*  everything right now, we've got to look at how do we get innovation going so that we [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6496.0s)]
*  get better, for instance, nuclear or better of this Craig Venter guy ideas or these many, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6500.5199999999995s)]
*  many other ideas that are out there. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6507.5199999999995s)]
*  We should be funding all of those. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6509.08s)]
*  So I helped assemble together with, I believe, it was 49 of the world's top climate [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6510.32s)]
*  economists and three Nobel laureates to look at how do you best and smartest invest in [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6517.84s)]
*  green energy so better deal with climate change. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6524.04s)]
*  What they found was the long term best strategy was invest in green energy research and [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6527.12s)]
*  development. So that's the long term because there could be some innovation that would [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6533.44s)]
*  be groundbreaking. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6537.639999999999s)]
*  Basically, if you get innovation and you find a breakthrough, you will have fixed the [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6539.0s)]
*  problem. If you don't get that innovation, we just won't fix the problem. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6544.240000000001s)]
*  We'll do a little bit of it at very, very high cost and we'll end up a little bit like [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6548.4800000000005s)]
*  we talked about with Germany. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6552.080000000001s)]
*  Right. You'll you'll end up spending half a trillion dollars and cut a tiny bit of your [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6553.160000000001s)]
*  emissions to sort of shift the narrative and get people to stop being terrified of a [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6557.040000000001s)]
*  future with the climate increasing the way it is on a steady rate. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6564.96s)]
*  Like what what can you say to people that would get them to look? [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6569.36s)]
*  Is there like a real simple way of breaking this down that gives people an understanding of [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6575.04s)]
*  the perspective? Like how much this has been exaggerated? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6580.28s)]
*  How how what the danger actually is like one of the big ones is Miami. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6584.12s)]
*  Ten years. Miami is going to be underwater. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6589.04s)]
*  But meanwhile, banks keep financing people building these giant skyscrapers next to the [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6591.28s)]
*  water. What's going on? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6596.04s)]
*  Is Miami going underwater? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6597.6s)]
*  No. I mean, and the simple reason is because we know around the world that when sea levels [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6599.28s)]
*  rise, it is very cheap and simple to avoid most of those problems. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6605.32s)]
*  And Holland obviously is the great example. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6610.28s)]
*  Holland has while sea levels have been rising, they've actually gotten much larger because [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6613.2s)]
*  they know how to do this and they're very, very safe. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6619.96s)]
*  Remember, 40 percent of the country is underwater. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6622.16s)]
*  If you go to Shiphol, which is the 14th largest airport in the world, Amsterdam Airport, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6624.4s)]
*  they proudly say on their website that we're the only major airport in the world that was [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6629.8s)]
*  previously a site of a major naval battle. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6634.4400000000005s)]
*  But you don't feel it. They're fine there. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6638.36s)]
*  And so how would they do that with the total cost over the last 50 years for Holland is [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6640.92s)]
*  about 10 billion dollars. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6647.12s)]
*  The total cost of protecting Holland. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6649.240000000001s)]
*  This is not nothing. But, you know, for a rich country over 50 years, that's almost [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6651.320000000001s)]
*  nothing. It's not that bad. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6655.320000000001s)]
*  So what about Miami, though? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6656.4800000000005s)]
*  How would they protect Miami? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6657.8s)]
*  So I don't know specifically how you do this for Miami. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6659.400000000001s)]
*  The point is Miami is incredibly valuable. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6662.92s)]
*  Obviously, you find as I understand it, there is actually some problems with that. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6666.08s)]
*  It's built on coral. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6670.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's harder to. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6671.6s)]
*  Yes, it'll be harder to do. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6672.72s)]
*  I'm not saying this is going to be easy, but this is the kind of thing. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6674.4800000000005s)]
*  But you didn't say it was going to be easy. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6677.08s)]
*  Well, in general, we know how to do these things. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6678.0s)]
*  And so I don't know how specifically you're going to do this for Miami. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6681.56s)]
*  But I do know that we've done this almost everywhere on the planet. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6685.76s)]
*  Remember, if you go to New York Times took me down to the waterfront of a cafe in New [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6689.12s)]
*  York when I published my first climate book. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6695.56s)]
*  And that this is now what five streets away from the waterfront. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6698.92s)]
*  Right. Because New York has actually grown. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6702.04s)]
*  We've seen the same thing happen everywhere on the planet. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6704.28s)]
*  So even Bangladesh, which is a very poor country, has actually increased at land [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6707.48s)]
*  surface while sea levels have risen because we know how to do those. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6713.04s)]
*  Has anybody done that? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6716.44s)]
*  Like with a model for Miami? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6718.08s)]
*  Because again, what you are saying I had heard was that the problem is the ground is [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6720.24s)]
*  porous and that whenever there's like any sort of a water event in Miami, the streets [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6724.76s)]
*  are flooded and that they're worried that as the ocean level rises, this would be [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6729.679999999999s)]
*  insurmountable. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6733.679999999999s)]
*  Like, I don't know if that's a simple problem as what they're dealing with in [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6734.88s)]
*  Holland or in a lot of other places where they make dams and seawalls. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6738.32s)]
*  What they do with New Orleans. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6742.28s)]
*  Yes. And I don't. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6743.4s)]
*  So I should possibly have been less quick and say, you son of a bitch, that's what [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6745.44s)]
*  you've done. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6749.12s)]
*  Miami, I don't know everywhere else. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6749.719999999999s)]
*  We have. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6752.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6752.839999999999s)]
*  So there are good global models that look at this. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6753.08s)]
*  If I can actually show you a graph of a global model on. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6756.08s)]
*  So it's number 23 on a on the A file. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6760.72s)]
*  So this is a model for the world that looks at how many people are getting flooded. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6765.8s)]
*  And what it shows you is that in in 2000, about three million people got flooded [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6770.56s)]
*  every year. And so you can see over there in 2000, three million people get flooded [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6776.08s)]
*  and has a cost of zero point zero five percent of GDP. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6781.04s)]
*  Now, if you assume that there's going to be no adaptation, this is pretty much where [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6784.64s)]
*  all the catastrophic stories come from. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6789.0s)]
*  You end up in this situation where, you know, one hundred and eighty seven million [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6791.4800000000005s)]
*  people will be flooded. This number has been both on the cover of Wall Street. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6794.84s)]
*  Sorry. Washington Post and the New York Times. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6799.360000000001s)]
*  And there's a New York Times op-ed lots and lots of this is at 2100 year 2100 [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6801.8s)]
*  2100. If sea levels rise, we do nothing about it. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6806.4400000000005s)]
*  Then obviously this is going to be terrible. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6811.08s)]
*  So it's going to cost five percent of global GDP. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6813.16s)]
*  But this is not the world we live in. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6816.0s)]
*  We'll actually adapt. And that's where you know. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6817.4s)]
*  So that's why I said in this general thing, it's not going to happen for Miami. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6819.36s)]
*  But I don't know whether the model has actually modeled, particularly Miami. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6822.92s)]
*  It's modeled the world. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6827.28s)]
*  This seems like a real problem, though, like if there's not real adaptation [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6828.24s)]
*  ideas that are on the books that seem like they could be implemented. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6833.799999999999s)]
*  Eighty years ago by pretty quickly, if one hundred and eighty seven million people [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6837.92s)]
*  are flooded, if there's no adaptation, then you have to also think about population [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6841.04s)]
*  increase. You have to think about the increase in the amount of CO2 [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6845.0s)]
*  we release. There's a lot of other things you have to factor in along with no [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6849.88s)]
*  adaptation. But the but the point is, we will not be in this world. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6854.6s)]
*  Are you sure? Yes. And the authors themselves say this is absolutely [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6858.44s)]
*  inconceivable. Worst case scenario. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6862.92s)]
*  Everybody will actually adapt. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6864.84s)]
*  You will put up high sea sea dikes. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6867.04s)]
*  And much of this is not going to be these, you know, amazingly big structures that [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6870.52s)]
*  are going to feel overwhelming. It's just simply water management. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6874.6s)]
*  And so the realistic outcome is that by the end of the century, about [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6877.400000000001s)]
*  fifteen thousand people will be flooded. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6881.120000000001s)]
*  And the cost of GDP will be both for protection and from flood [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6883.4800000000005s)]
*  costs will be almost 10 times lower in percent of GDP. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6888.280000000001s)]
*  So this adaptation that you show on this chart, where's this chart from? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6892.200000000001s)]
*  So this is from one of the most quoted story stories. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6896.52s)]
*  This is one of the few articles that actually both look at both adaptation [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6899.4400000000005s)]
*  and no adaptation. So it's from Hinkle 2014. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6903.84s)]
*  I think it's yeah, it's I don't have internet, so I can't actually show you right now. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6907.84s)]
*  So no adaptation. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6912.88s)]
*  It drops down below the rate where it's at currently. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6914.84s)]
*  Sorry. With that, excuse me, with adaptation. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6918.32s)]
*  The the amount of people flooded drops below and much, much below. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6921.24s)]
*  Right. From three million to virtually nobody to fifteen thousand. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6925.08s)]
*  And that is but that's that that's globally. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6929.92s)]
*  That's globally. What that tells you is that this is an issue that we fix. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6932.64s)]
*  We know how to fix. And Holland is a great example of that. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6937.92s)]
*  If you're rich, you fix it. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6940.92s)]
*  If you're poor, you have a real problem. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6942.84s)]
*  This, of course, is why so many people died in China and India when there were [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6945.040000000001s)]
*  floods back in the 1920s, as we were talking about before. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6949.040000000001s)]
*  When you're poor, life sucks in so many different ways. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6952.76s)]
*  It also sucks from climate. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6956.76s)]
*  And that's, of course, one of the reasons why I think when people say and this [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6958.76s)]
*  they're right to say that climate is going to harm the world's poor the most. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6961.92s)]
*  And they sort of jump to this unwarranted conclusion. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6966.32s)]
*  So we need to do something about climate. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6969.68s)]
*  No, it's because it sucks to be poor. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6971.36s)]
*  We should do something about not being poor. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6974.0s)]
*  You know, there's a big hurricane that hit Tacloban in 2013. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6976.4400000000005s)]
*  Philippine, a Filipino city. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6981.76s)]
*  And it happened right when there was a global warming meeting, [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6984.4400000000005s)]
*  one of the big cop meetings, and everybody outpoured and said, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6989.56s)]
*  oh, this is because of global warming. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6993.64s)]
*  Of course, it was actually a exactly similar hurricane 100 years before. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=6995.12s)]
*  I have 19 know something [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7000.28s)]
*  that that happened that followed the exact same path [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7004.04s)]
*  and killed half the city's population back then. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7007.56s)]
*  It was much, much worse. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7010.76s)]
*  This time, it only killed about two percent of the of the city's population. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7012.0s)]
*  But the people who got killed and the people who got harm [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7017.599999999999s)]
*  were still, you know, essentially living under corrugated roofs. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7020.88s)]
*  Our job is to make sure that they don't live under corrugated roofs, [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7024.44s)]
*  that they actually live in good buildings, that they have those clamps [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7027.96s)]
*  we talked about, that they have all these other opportunities [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7030.5199999999995s)]
*  so that they can live well. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7033.32s)]
*  Of course, we should also in the long run [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7034.92s)]
*  find a way to actually make sure we fix climate change. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7037.28s)]
*  But it's wrong to say because these poor people are going to be [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7039.8s)]
*  focused with more climate change, we should do something about climate change. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7043.12s)]
*  No, these poor people are going to be focused with all kinds of bad things [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7046.28s)]
*  from malnutrition and bad education and from diseases because they're poor. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7049.679999999999s)]
*  If we want to help them, we should lift them out of poverty. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7055.12s)]
*  That's a solution you don't ever hear before. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7058.08s)]
*  You very hear hear very little of when it comes to dealing with the situation [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7061.0s)]
*  in terms of the amount of impact on deaths. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7064.639999999999s)]
*  And the amazing thing is, of course, this is what made our lives great. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7067.599999999999s)]
*  Of course, most of the rest of the world want the exact same thing. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7073.8s)]
*  And we should let them have it. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7077.72s)]
*  So the real challenge here is how do we find a way [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7079.68s)]
*  that means the vast amount, so the six point five billion people [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7083.2s)]
*  who are not rich can actually get a great living by the end of the century. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7087.52s)]
*  And we can also fix climate change. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7092.2s)]
*  And that's only going to happen if we find the technological breakthroughs, [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7094.12s)]
*  not by telling everyone, I'm sorry, could you do with less? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7097.64s)]
*  Not only is that not going to win any elections in the long run, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7100.44s)]
*  but it's also just not going to be possible to convince China, India, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7103.4s)]
*  Africa to do that. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7106.92s)]
*  Now, what about the impact on climate change and natural storms, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7108.2s)]
*  hurricanes and the like? [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7113.5199999999995s)]
*  Like, how much are they increasing? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7114.96s)]
*  How much is the severity of them increasing? [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7117.0s)]
*  Because that's a big point of confusion for people. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7119.759999999999s)]
*  I've heard I've heard multiple people say that those storms are worse than ever [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7121.759999999999s)]
*  and more frequent than ever. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7126.4s)]
*  And then I've heard people say, no, they're actually less frequent than ever, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7127.48s)]
*  but stronger. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7130.759999999999s)]
*  I've even heard people say, no, no, no, they're more frequent and less strong. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7131.799999999999s)]
*  So I don't know what's going on now. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7135.5199999999995s)]
*  So if the biggest point on this, I think, is they're certainly much stronger on TV. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7138.12s)]
*  I mean, you hear much, much more about them because they're such great. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7144.879999999999s)]
*  They're such great stories. Yeah, they absolutely they sell. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7148.599999999999s)]
*  But if you actually look at the data, we cannot tell right now. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7151.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's that's the conclusion from the from the government agencies of the US as well. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7155.72s)]
*  We can't still tell that there is a fingerprint from climate change on hurricanes. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7160.4800000000005s)]
*  We can't. So no, we can't. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7166.320000000001s)]
*  Why can't we? Because there is such natural variability [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7167.96s)]
*  that you can't see, oh, this increase or this decrease is because of global warming. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7171.96s)]
*  Is there an increased trend currently? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7176.2s)]
*  Well, so in the 1960s, sorry, in the 1970s and 80s, [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7178.96s)]
*  there was a lull in hurricanes that hit the US. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7185.0s)]
*  That was also when satellite coverage started. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7188.4800000000005s)]
*  So much of what you see now is if you start from the 1970s or 1980s, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7191.360000000001s)]
*  there is an increase for the US. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7196.200000000001s)]
*  But that's probably spurious, because if you go back in the 1950s and 1960s, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7199.76s)]
*  there was actually just as many hurricanes. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7206.4800000000005s)]
*  So what you do and this is by far the best estimate. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7209.12s)]
*  So I actually have that. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7212.4400000000005s)]
*  I brought that with me. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7213.48s)]
*  If you take a look at slide four on a in the A file, [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7215.28s)]
*  there we see if you look at the number of hurricanes that have hit the US, [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7220.759999999999s)]
*  because remember, we don't know about this hurricanes that we couldn't see [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7224.48s)]
*  back when we didn't have satellites. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7228.679999999999s)]
*  Now we see them because we have satellites, but that's obviously the wrong way to counter [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7230.36s)]
*  to count. So if you just look at the hurricanes that landfall on the US, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7234.599999999999s)]
*  you get this graph. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7239.16s)]
*  And this is 1900 to 2022. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7240.96s)]
*  Yeah. So 2022 is obviously not done, but it's probably done. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7245.16s)]
*  And it looks incredibly similar. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7249.04s)]
*  It's actually slightly decreasing. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7251.88s)]
*  This is not significantly decreasing from 2008. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7255.04s)]
*  Sorry. From 2004, from 19. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7258.44s)]
*  If you try to put in the best line, as you can see, that's the dotted red line. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7261.08s)]
*  You actually have slightly decreasing lines. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7265.28s)]
*  Oh, I see. I see the overall the average. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7267.84s)]
*  The overall average used to be more like two hurricanes per season. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7270.04s)]
*  What? That's down to one point six or something. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7274.68s)]
*  Sorry. What the hell was going on in 1980? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7277.68s)]
*  It looks like 86. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7279.96s)]
*  I was going to pull up it. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7282.76s)]
*  This is a contradicting chart, though. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7284.6s)]
*  OK. It specifies, though, North Atlantic, which this does not. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7286.84s)]
*  OK. So North Atlantic is where the predominant amount of hurricanes [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7293.400000000001s)]
*  exist in the United States. Is that correct? [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7297.12s)]
*  Or South Atlantic? [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7299.12s)]
*  It's South Atlantic. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7301.0s)]
*  So North Atlantic would have less of them because the water is cold. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7301.84s)]
*  Northern hemisphere, I believe, is not not north compared to the United States. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7304.5599999999995s)]
*  It's north for South hemisphere. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7307.6s)]
*  Oh, OK. OK. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7309.16s)]
*  Why Atlantic hurricanes are getting stronger faster than other storms. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7310.28s)]
*  So hurricane Ian to do 264 percent since 1980 [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7313.96s)]
*  compared to the globe, according to this chart, percentage of tropical [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7318.48s)]
*  cyclone activity with major intensity. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7322.16s)]
*  So major intensity indicates that sustained wind speeds [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7324.84s)]
*  reach a category three level or higher. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7327.84s)]
*  So it seems like there's more. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7330.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes. And notice what that happens. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7331.4400000000005s)]
*  It starts in 1980. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7333.360000000001s)]
*  And that's why when you when you do these numbers, it's very easy to get this [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7335.6s)]
*  number, this result if you start in 1980 when they were much lower. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7339.4400000000005s)]
*  If I can just show you the other graph again, [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7343.360000000001s)]
*  because I showed you for all of the hurricanes, but we also have [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7345.4800000000005s)]
*  if you take the next slide for that's just the strong hurricane. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7348.92s)]
*  So that's exactly the same as what you just showed. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7353.48s)]
*  Category three and and and higher. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7356.08s)]
*  And what you see here again is that there are fewer hurricanes, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7360.04s)]
*  not not more hurricanes hitting the US today [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7363.48s)]
*  than they used to be back in the early part of the same. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7367.32s)]
*  There's only one per year or yes. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7370.12s)]
*  That doesn't feel like that's right, though. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7373.16s)]
*  This is one major hurricane landfalling each year. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7374.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Is that usually what we get? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7378.639999999999s)]
*  And so if you go all the way back to 2006, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7381.12s)]
*  which is that year we were talking about, it looks like there was four. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7384.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that so from 80. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7387.4s)]
*  So when you're looking at that major 2005, that was Hurricane Katrina [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7389.68s)]
*  and all these others. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7393.5199999999995s)]
*  So when you're looking at that other chart that shows the increase from 1980, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7395.08s)]
*  see with 1980, it's just all those years, it's just one. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7398.5599999999995s)]
*  And then it gets up to four in 2006. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7401.8s)]
*  And that's a rough year. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7406.12s)]
*  So all that factors into the average and that kicks the average up to two [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7406.84s)]
*  hundred and sixty four percent. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7410.599999999999s)]
*  But a lot of it is from 2006. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7411.48s)]
*  And a lot of it is because you just go from a period when there is a relative [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7414.44s)]
*  low to a period when it's back up on these charts. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7419.08s)]
*  What is it differentiating as major or not major? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7422.12s)]
*  Because then we get to like we almost got through all the names, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7425.28s)]
*  I thought a couple of years ago. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7427.639999999999s)]
*  So yes. Sorry. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7428.88s)]
*  So major is category three. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7430.799999999999s)]
*  But these all landfalling. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7432.92s)]
*  Remember, a lot of hurricanes are not landfalling. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7434.759999999999s)]
*  So the reason why we run out of names is because they there we are able to see [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7437.92s)]
*  a lot more of them. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7442.96s)]
*  So they actually estimate this is a reanalysis by Noah and all those guys. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7444.04s)]
*  So they actually found that we now name about four storms more [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7449.200000000001s)]
*  than we would have named in the early 2000s every year [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7454.6s)]
*  because we're just become better at notice. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7459.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, there was a hurricane and then it dropped, dropped off. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7461.88s)]
*  Right. Because they don't hit. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7465.280000000001s)]
*  Not only because they don't hit, but typically they're just one or two days. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7467.4s)]
*  And what's the percentage of them that actually hit? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7471.28s)]
*  The problem is, like when they get strong enough on the ocean, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7474.04s)]
*  that they can carry over onto the land and devastate the land. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7477.679999999999s)]
*  So the reason why I'm looking at landfall is because in the early part of last [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7480.12s)]
*  century, you would have it's very likely that someone would have noticed [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7484.04s)]
*  landfalling hurricane anywhere in the US. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7488.04s)]
*  But if it's out in the middle of nowhere, there's a very good chance [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7491.16s)]
*  nobody would have noticed. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7494.32s)]
*  Actually, you can see in the in the data that when the [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7495.6s)]
*  the Panama Canal opened, suddenly, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7500.160000000001s)]
*  ships started going a different route. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7504.320000000001s)]
*  So there is a big part of the Atlantic that they no longer traversed. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7506.8s)]
*  And so we never so the number of hurricanes dropped in those areas [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7511.0s)]
*  because you needed to have sort of a ship to be out there and noticing. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7515.320000000001s)]
*  That's why it's a very, very bad way to look at this. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7519.72s)]
*  If you just look at how many hurricanes do we know about? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7522.52s)]
*  Because we just know about a lot more now. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7525.44s)]
*  So that's from satellite radar. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7527.32s)]
*  And that was what year they started implementing satellite. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7528.5599999999995s)]
*  This is about 1980. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7531.679999999999s)]
*  OK, so that's when OK. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7533.639999999999s)]
*  So it's not clear. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7535.4s)]
*  But your point was to basically say [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7537.84s)]
*  what people will are worried about is that there's going to be a lot more hurricanes. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7540.679999999999s)]
*  Yes. Well, actually, so the best evidence seems to indicate [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7544.599999999999s)]
*  that was one of the points that you said that there will probably be fewer hurricanes, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7548.24s)]
*  but they will be stronger. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7552.88s)]
*  And overall, stronger is worse than fewer is better, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7555.08s)]
*  which means that overall, they'll be slightly more damage. Right. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7560.16s)]
*  So global warming is bad. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7563.84s)]
*  That's one of the many things that will actually be worse with global warming. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7565.48s)]
*  But it's not terribly bad. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7570.08s)]
*  It's somewhat worse. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7572.2s)]
*  And of course, at the same time, we're getting much better at dealing with this impact. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7573.68s)]
*  What you're actually seeing, if you look at the total cost, for instance, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7578.28s)]
*  on on on on hurricane impacts and all kinds of climate impacts, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7581.92s)]
*  it's actually going down, not up in percent in percent of GDP. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7585.92s)]
*  Why? Because we now know we have much better prediction. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7590.76s)]
*  We know how to deal with these things, for instance, get [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7594.4400000000005s)]
*  a lot of a lot of stuff that can be moved. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7597.76s)]
*  We get it out of harm's way. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7599.72s)]
*  So every time there's a hurricane, you know, all all trucks will go to other states, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7601.280000000001s)]
*  that kind of thing. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7606.16s)]
*  So there's a lot of things that don't get damaged. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7606.8s)]
*  We can also build better, as you talked about. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7609.4800000000005s)]
*  With houses and so on. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7611.96s)]
*  So we have a lot of ways to reduce us. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7613.280000000001s)]
*  But what is happening is it'll reduce slightly less fast because of global warming. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7615.4400000000005s)]
*  Again, not the end of the world, but a problem. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7620.56s)]
*  So the fear mongering would have you terrified about a future [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7623.12s)]
*  that's impossible to fix and that we're doomed. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7627.320000000001s)]
*  And you're simply saying it is a problem, but it's not our biggest problem. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7630.96s)]
*  It's it's it's a problem in the sense that it slows down progress. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7635.04s)]
*  And if I can just, you know, because people talk a lot about [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7639.52s)]
*  the fact that we won't have enough food either. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7643.32s)]
*  I have I have another slide on in the B file. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7647.16s)]
*  And God, I need glasses. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7651.36s)]
*  And number six. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7654.56s)]
*  Nineteen. Sorry, I was just Googling this. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7655.76s)]
*  Twenty twenty, it says eleven hurricanes made it to land. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7658.2s)]
*  Here total of eleven named storms made landfall in United States, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7665.16s)]
*  breaking the previous record of nine in nineteen. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7668.12s)]
*  Sorry, eleven named storms or six of these were storms [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7669.96s)]
*  struck the United States as hurricane intensity. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7674.36s)]
*  They were talking about category three and above. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7676.48s)]
*  That was that that was just this one. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7678.68s)]
*  His chart, which was this is all hurricanes. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7680.36s)]
*  This is major hurricanes. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7683.2s)]
*  You know, what is it? [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7684.36s)]
*  So category one, which is the worst category one, the worst or four? [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7685.08s)]
*  No, this is four is the worst, right? [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7688.76s)]
*  Five is the worst. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7690.24s)]
*  This is four hurricanes hit us and four. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7691.5199999999995s)]
*  And then when I Google it, it says there's at least six, if not eleven. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7693.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's I mean, this this is period literature. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7697.32s)]
*  I have no doubt the updates are for the guy. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7701.32s)]
*  This is 2020, Jamie. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7704.16s)]
*  Yeah, I just was trying to pick one year. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7705.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that was all, you know. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7707.36s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7709.76s)]
*  And these and the one that this was saying, they're intensifying. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7711.400000000001s)]
*  This says that like since 1950, only [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7714.52s)]
*  nine category four hurricanes have made hit the mainland. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7718.4800000000005s)]
*  But six of those were in the last five years. Whoa. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7721.12s)]
*  That seems like a problem. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7724.16s)]
*  That's a big problem. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7727.32s)]
*  Doesn't that seem like a big problem? [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7729.68s)]
*  Me seeing that, I would see why people would freak out again. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7731.6s)]
*  And this is so we can't sit here and do period research in in real time. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7735.24s)]
*  I'm sure. But you do need contradicting. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7740.92s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. Absolutely. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7744.44s)]
*  But I am saying that so I'm happy to say that we should. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7746.28s)]
*  I'm happy to say that we should. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7750.56s)]
*  So there's very little four and five hurricanes. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7752.400000000001s)]
*  That's why they the major and that was also why the other graph [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7755.04s)]
*  showed the change in in [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7758.92s)]
*  in three, three, four and five. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7762.72s)]
*  Back to that again, please. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7764.92s)]
*  Look at that, man. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7766.6s)]
*  Andrew was even more powerful than Ian in 92. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7767.6s)]
*  That was a hundred and sixty five mile an hour. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7771.56s)]
*  What's the fucking strongest one that we've ever had? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7773.92s)]
*  Is that all of them that we've had during the last? [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7777.360000000001s)]
*  So that's the last 50 years. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7780.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think when I was like 92, I think so. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7781.72s)]
*  Ian was the strongest or Andrew, excuse me, was the strongest. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7783.52s)]
*  That was one sixty five. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7786.36s)]
*  Katrina is not even on this list. No. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7787.88s)]
*  Wow. Why isn't Katrina on the list? I don't know. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7790.44s)]
*  That was a big one, wasn't it? Yeah. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7793.88s)]
*  Wasn't it Hurricane three? [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7796.8s)]
*  It could have been big and long and just lasted for a long time. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7798.88s)]
*  Right. The devastation was big because of where it hit. Yes. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7801.8s)]
*  Wow. Also, if you look at the major hurricanes, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7805.88s)]
*  we had the biggest drought ever. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7810.2s)]
*  So there were 11 years where there were no major hurricane [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7812.4s)]
*  that hit the US recently. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7815.08s)]
*  I don't know if you noticed that was when nobody talked about hurricanes. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7817.24s)]
*  And then, of course, the hurricanes came back and then we said, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7821.16s)]
*  oh, see global warming again. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7823.84s)]
*  This is how we're not being well served with this kind of conversation. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7825.6s)]
*  What is your book called? False alarm. False alarm. Yeah. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7828.92s)]
*  Because you know, no, I don't have one yet. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7831.72s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7834.88s)]
*  I don't I wouldn't say false alarm. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7836.6s)]
*  I would say there's a lot of other shit to be worried about as well. Yes. Yes. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7839.280000000001s)]
*  But it is. But it also seems to be a problem. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7843.240000000001s)]
*  That's the other book I brought here. Prioritizing development. Yes. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7845.240000000001s)]
*  Ah, see. So this is this is basically this is what my day job really is. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7848.8s)]
*  Because as you also know, and as we talked a little bit about. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7853.84s)]
*  So look, there is a lot of problems in the world and for most people. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7858.04s)]
*  So rich people who are, you know, well ensconced in their lives and they, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7862.280000000001s)]
*  you know, they don't have to worry about their kids dying from [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7866.84s)]
*  infectious diseases or or not having enough food, all that kind of stuff. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7869.96s)]
*  They clearly can worry about what the temperature is going to be in 100 years. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7874.6s)]
*  But for most of the planet's population, so, you know, the six point five billion [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7878.64s)]
*  people here, they actually worry about their kids might die tonight. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7882.4400000000005s)]
*  They might not have enough food. They have terrible education. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7886.2s)]
*  There are all kinds of other terrible things. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7889.32s)]
*  You know, almost a billion people are extremely poor. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7891.400000000001s)]
*  So in terms of the overall impact on human health and life, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7895.16s)]
*  elevating the economy is the most important step that people can take. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7899.36s)]
*  It's certainly a very important part of it. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7904.28s)]
*  And again, when we sorry, if I could just show you the one of malnutrition, [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7906.88s)]
*  the the slide from the B set stack number six. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7910.68s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7915.12s)]
*  So what I just want to show you was that malnutrition has come down dramatically. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7923.2s)]
*  And again, what you see here, so this is the number of death from [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7927.28s)]
*  from kids that are less than five years old. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7932.08s)]
*  And again, this is very similar to the other chart, but a little bit of a [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7934.84s)]
*  difference. The difference between with climate change and without climate [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7937.48s)]
*  change, without climate change is only slightly lower. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7940.5599999999995s)]
*  But the overall trend is much, much, much lower than it was in 1990. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7943.12s)]
*  And this is because we're getting better at making agriculture. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7946.84s)]
*  This is what we talked about before. They're much better in India. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7950.76s)]
*  They're much better everywhere. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7953.32s)]
*  And the overall net benefit is positive. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7954.64s)]
*  We're moving towards a world that's going to be much better. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7957.36s)]
*  So these guys that are protesting think it's the end of the world. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7960.2s)]
*  No, it's not. It's a world that's going to be much better. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7963.28s)]
*  But they're right in saying that climate is one problem and we should definitely [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7965.48s)]
*  think about how we fix that. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7969.88s)]
*  But we should also remember a large part of this is how do we fix all the other [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7971.599999999999s)]
*  problems? There are still people, you know, there's one of the things that [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7975.839999999999s)]
*  just blow my mind. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7979.5199999999995s)]
*  We all worried about covid. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7982.0s)]
*  But remember, the world's biggest infectious disease killer over the last [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7983.92s)]
*  200 years has been tuberculosis, probably killed about a billion people in total. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7987.08s)]
*  It still kills one and a half million people every year. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7991.4s)]
*  And we know how to fix it. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7995.16s)]
*  We figured that out a hundred years ago. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7997.36s)]
*  That's why no one in the rich world died from this. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=7999.72s)]
*  But apart from covid is the world's leading infectious disease killer. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8002.52s)]
*  And we do nothing against it. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8006.68s)]
*  We could at very low cost fix most of this problem. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8008.280000000001s)]
*  And so one of the things I try to push is to say, look, for very little money, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8012.08s)]
*  we could actually so we're talking about three billion dollars a year or [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8016.4800000000005s)]
*  thereabouts. We could actually save almost everyone from tuberculosis. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8019.4800000000005s)]
*  Why don't we make that one of the things we want to do? [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8024.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's interesting. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8026.88s)]
*  That's not a sexy headline. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8028.32s)]
*  It gets people riled up and scared because they're not worried about [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8029.96s)]
*  tuberculosis over here. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8032.12s)]
*  And we're not worried about our kids getting tuberculosis. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8033.48s)]
*  So in some sense, it's because it's it's over there. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8036.92s)]
*  It's a lot of people in India and in Africa and so on. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8039.679999999999s)]
*  But in some way, it doesn't quite make it OK. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8043.32s)]
*  I see what you're saying. So what you're trying to promote is a balanced message. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8046.36s)]
*  And you're trying to counter the this the climate change fear mongering [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8050.08s)]
*  by saying it is one of our issues, but it is surmountable, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8055.719999999999s)]
*  at least in some aspects of it. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8060.04s)]
*  Oh, it's look, the world will be much better off by the end of the century. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8061.96s)]
*  But because of global warming will be slightly less, much better off. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8066.799999999999s)]
*  So what do you think if you contemplated the motivations for this [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8071.04s)]
*  fear mongering and this distorted perception of of this one [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8075.5599999999995s)]
*  very particular issue, you know, when you look at all the issues that we face, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8080.5599999999995s)]
*  you've outlined why, why that one? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8084.64s)]
*  Why that why does that one get the most heat? [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8087.04s)]
*  So as you just mentioned, it's partly because it's our kids [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8089.56s)]
*  rather than someone else's kids who are going to get influenced by this. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8093.68s)]
*  We also just love having something to worry about. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8097.96s)]
*  I think that's to a very large extent. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8100.4400000000005s)]
*  And then, of course, we have a lot of media [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8102.0s)]
*  that has an interest in pushing a catastrophic agenda about anything. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8105.68s)]
*  Yeah. So anything is catastrophic. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8109.96s)]
*  Anything is something that we should worry intensely about. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8111.92s)]
*  Is it just the media or is it also a political ploy? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8114.76s)]
*  Oh, of course, it's also politicians for a very long time. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8117.32s)]
*  This was the gift that kept on giving for politicians [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8121.4s)]
*  because they basically got to say the world is ending, but I can save you. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8124.8s)]
*  Right. I can't do that voice, but you know what? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8130.84s)]
*  I wanted to. Yeah, I got. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8132.96s)]
*  So so fundamentally, imagine being able to say, I can save you [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8135.64s)]
*  and will promise to do some stuff that will only happen [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8139.96s)]
*  long into the future, long after I've stopped being president or whatever it is. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8143.4400000000005s)]
*  Right now, of course, this is catching up with us [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8148.24s)]
*  because now we actually have to start paying for all of this. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8151.64s)]
*  And this is where the wheels come off, because most people are just not willing. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8154.92s)]
*  Most people are willing to pay something to do good for the environment. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8159.68s)]
*  They're certainly not willing to pay, you know, five thousand dollars per person per year. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8163.12s)]
*  That's just not going to happen. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8167.4400000000005s)]
*  Most people most sure a few, you know, a few very wealthy. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8168.68s)]
*  The hardcore lefties will go, we got to take the billionaires. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8172.92s)]
*  They can fix it all. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8176.0s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just not that's just not true. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8177.08s)]
*  Right. I mean, they would run out of money really quickly. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8179.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8181.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. budget is what a thousand. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8182.4400000000005s)]
*  What is it? Two, three thousand billion. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8186.280000000001s)]
*  The federal budget, a thousand billion dollars. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8188.4800000000005s)]
*  And what Elon has to three hundred million. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8191.72s)]
*  Yeah, he would run out in two weeks. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8195.6s)]
*  He's running out of it. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8197.04s)]
*  Twitter. Well, but you know, the point the point is these billionaires. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8198.0s)]
*  Sure. You know, I'm all for it that they should do more. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8202.080000000002s)]
*  And I think some of them are doing excellent work and some of them are probably not. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8204.84s)]
*  But this is not how you solve this problem. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8209.240000000002s)]
*  This is about making sure that you actually responsibly can do it [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8211.480000000001s)]
*  with the budgets that you have or with realistic tax increases. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8215.560000000001s)]
*  And, you know, increasing your tax five or 10 percent of GDP is just not realistic. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8219.04s)]
*  Do you have a fear that the fear mongering and the way [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8224.16s)]
*  concern, I should say, about the fear mongering and the way it's portrayed [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8228.24s)]
*  in the media is going to cause people to vote for things and to vote for people [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8230.64s)]
*  that are going to implement things that will ultimately be more destructive [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8235.84s)]
*  than they are beneficial? Oh, absolutely. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8238.6s)]
*  I mean, partly, if we're suggesting we should do policies [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8240.76s)]
*  because we're worried that this is the end of the world coming up [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8245.16s)]
*  that are enormously ineffective, which is what most of the world has done. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8247.96s)]
*  Then we're going to waste a lot of money. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8251.8s)]
*  But likewise, on the other side, so you could say this is sort of Democrats [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8253.560000000001s)]
*  here in the US, right? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8256.92s)]
*  But likewise, there's a lot of Republicans that are, oh, no problem whatsoever. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8258.44s)]
*  Just keep fracking, do whatever. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8263.640000000001s)]
*  And, you know, because you get sick and tired of having to pay those extra taxes [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8266.44s)]
*  from the Democrats, you might very well end up electing Republicans as well. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8270.68s)]
*  They'll just not do anything to solve the problem. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8274.6s)]
*  And so I really think this polarization, this is the end of the world, [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8277.720000000001s)]
*  it's not happening at all, is very unhelpful, both in terms [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8281.56s)]
*  that scares people witless, but it also makes it very hard to make these sensible [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8285.119999999999s)]
*  middle of the road kind of arguments, which is we're not going to solve this [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8289.68s)]
*  by huge taxation, we're not going to solve this by making lots of people pay [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8293.359999999999s)]
*  for ineffective policies. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8297.6s)]
*  What we are going to solve this with is innovation. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8298.84s)]
*  So we should be spending a lot more on innovation. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8301.4s)]
*  But the beauty of it is right now, globally, the world spends about [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8303.32s)]
*  just under 20 billion dollars per year on innovation into green energy. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8307.439999999999s)]
*  That's in percentage much less than we've done over the last 30 years [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8312.679999999998s)]
*  because politicians want to go out and open new solar panel parks or wind [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8317.279999999999s)]
*  turbine parks, because that looks like something not, you know, fun eggheads. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8321.4s)]
*  Is that part of the problem? [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8325.359999999999s)]
*  Is the perception? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8326.4s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure it is. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8327.199999999999s)]
*  And what we should do is we should fivefold increase that to about [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8328.4s)]
*  100 billion dollars. President Obama and everybody else promised that back in [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8332.24s)]
*  Paris. And I'm happy to say we had a very, very tiny, small role in that. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8336.44s)]
*  We should be spending lots more on research and development in green energy [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8340.800000000001s)]
*  because that's how we're going to fix this problem. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8344.76s)]
*  But we'll only get to that if we actually get people to sort of calm down [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8346.960000000001s)]
*  and realize problem at the end of the world. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8351.76s)]
*  And don't tank the economy. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8354.44s)]
*  Why are you trying to fix the problem? [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8356.76s)]
*  Because then you'll limit the amount of available solutions [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8358.0s)]
*  because resources and resources. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8361.6s)]
*  And one of the really depressing things that we're seeing now, [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8363.320000000002s)]
*  if you've noticed, you know, growth rates are coming down. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8367.0s)]
*  The US used to grow what per capita three percent per year. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8370.36s)]
*  Yeah. Your your your your kids would be much richer than you. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8374.24s)]
*  But in many countries, both in the US and Europe, we're seeing much, much slower growth. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8378.76s)]
*  One of the reasons this is by no means the only reason, but one of the reasons [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8384.04s)]
*  is that we have somehow realized, oh, we should be sorry for all the things we're doing. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8387.6s)]
*  We should be doing more to counter global warming. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8392.44s)]
*  And one of the ways you can do that is by having little or no growth. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8396.880000000001s)]
*  But the problem with that, of course, is that also impacts everything else. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8400.36s)]
*  It makes it much more of a distributional issue. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8404.16s)]
*  You know, if the cake is no longer growing, everybody starts bickering [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8406.720000000001s)]
*  about who gets what slice of the of the cake. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8410.08s)]
*  And it makes everything harder to deal with. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8414.04s)]
*  And of course, at the same time, we have the entire developing world [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8416.720000000001s)]
*  that still just wants to get out of poverty. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8420.2s)]
*  And we're not really giving them a chance either. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8422.36s)]
*  We're, for instance, pretty much limiting them. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8424.24s)]
*  We've been telling Africa, for instance, for a longest time. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8426.76s)]
*  Sorry, you can't have gas. You can't have coal. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8429.28s)]
*  You should just go straight to solar and wind, which, of course, [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8431.6s)]
*  can't really power an economy, or at least not right now. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8434.560000000001s)]
*  And this while Europe is then starting to grind up more coal [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8438.36s)]
*  because we're cold and because of war in Ukraine. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8443.04s)]
*  This is a very complex issue. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8447.84s)]
*  And the problem is that in sound bites on the news, [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8449.6s)]
*  you don't get to dive into all of the aspects of these complex issues. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8453.76s)]
*  Knowing what you're knowing and like, how frustrating is this for you [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8459.24s)]
*  to try to spread this message? [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8462.08s)]
*  Because I'm sure you get labeled like immediate. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8463.56s)]
*  You're a climate change denier. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8466.0s)]
*  You're you're a shill. You're a bad person. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8468.68s)]
*  What you know, how frustrating is this for you [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8472.16s)]
*  when you're trying to get this message out and you're writing these books [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8474.359999999999s)]
*  and you're giving these speeches? [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8476.64s)]
*  I mean, fundamentally, if it would be wonderful [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8479.400000000001s)]
*  if everybody just said, hey, that's that sounds smart. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8484.08s)]
*  Let's do that. But, you know, that's not how the real world works. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8486.560000000001s)]
*  I think it's it's great to have the opportunity to actually push [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8489.800000000001s)]
*  what kind of solutions work. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8494.28s)]
*  So what we're trying to do, we work with lots of the world's top economists. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8496.32s)]
*  I've worked with seven Nobel laureates in economics, trying to say, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8500.2s)]
*  where can you spend money and do the most good? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8504.640000000001s)]
*  So on climate, we should be investing green energy R&D. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8506.6s)]
*  That's the way you fix this problem. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8510.32s)]
*  And then we should realize there are lots of other problems, [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8512.640000000001s)]
*  most of which you haven't heard of. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8515.0s)]
*  So, for instance, the frustrating thing and the thing that really drives [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8517.32s)]
*  most of global productivity is education. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8521.08s)]
*  Education almost everywhere sucks, but especially in the developing world. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8524.4s)]
*  A lot of teachers just don't know the stuff that they're actually [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8528.6s)]
*  supposed to be teaching the kids. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8531.6s)]
*  How do you get kids to be better educated? [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8534.56s)]
*  It turns out that there are some very, very simple ways [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8537.64s)]
*  that we know work incredibly well. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8540.64s)]
*  So it's called teaching according to level. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8543.0s)]
*  So the basic idea, you know, if you think about a sixth grade or something, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8546.119999999999s)]
*  where I don't know, is that 12 year olds? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8549.36s)]
*  Yeah, sixth grade is 12, 11, 11 year old. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8552.4s)]
*  So say you have all these six year. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8555.16s)]
*  Sorry. All these 12 year olds in the same grade, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8557.279999999999s)]
*  especially in the developing country, but even here, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8560.4s)]
*  they have very varying levels. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8563.48s)]
*  Some of them are just hanging on and don't quite know what's going on. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8565.24s)]
*  Some of them are far ahead of what the teacher is teaching. Right. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8569.24s)]
*  So the problem is when you're in that kind of grade [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8572.56s)]
*  where we put all the 12 year olds in one in one grade, [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8574.679999999998s)]
*  you're actually having a very hard time teaching all of these kids effectively. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8578.119999999999s)]
*  What we've shown with and this is not me. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8582.439999999999s)]
*  Lots of really smart people have shown this is in experiments. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8585.24s)]
*  If you instead make sure that each of these kids are taught [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8589.16s)]
*  at their right level, at the level that they are, they can learn a lot more. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8593.84s)]
*  Now, you could do that one or two ways. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8597.8s)]
*  You could actually shuffle these guys around. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8599.759999999998s)]
*  So, you know, that some 11 year olds are going to be together [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8602.0s)]
*  with some 13 year olds and maybe one nine year old and one 15 year old and so on. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8605.16s)]
*  So they all have the same level that has some social problems. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8609.72s)]
*  But they're doing it, for instance, in India. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8613.48s)]
*  You could also do it by every one hour every day. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8615.359999999999s)]
*  You sit them down with a tablet and this tablet then finds out what is your level. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8618.44s)]
*  So it's teaching it in either your language or your mathematics, for instance. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8623.48s)]
*  And they it very quickly adapts and find out what is your level [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8627.88s)]
*  and then teach you exactly at your level. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8631.6s)]
*  The beauty is you can actually teach these kids [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8633.88s)]
*  three years of schooling in one real year at very low extra cost. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8637.119999999999s)]
*  We're talking about twenty dollars per per student per year. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8642.92s)]
*  So if you do this with a tablet, you can basically have a situation [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8646.72s)]
*  where you can educate these kids much better and teach them much more. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8651.32s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8655.48s)]
*  That's assuming they engage with the material, right? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8656.24s)]
*  So this is more difficult to get them to engage with tablets [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8658.84s)]
*  than it is to get them to engage with a teacher. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8661.68s)]
*  No, actually, it turns off out. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8664.6s)]
*  It often is the opposite. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8666.92s)]
*  They they want to have more than just one hour. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8668.199999999999s)]
*  It's probably true if you did this a whole day, it's one hour a day. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8671.16s)]
*  It's partly because so other students can also use the tablet. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8674.32s)]
*  So it becomes cheaper. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8676.960000000001s)]
*  It's also partly because we don't want to upset the teachers, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8678.44s)]
*  because if the teachers don't like this idea, if they are worried [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8681.76s)]
*  that computers are going to take over their jobs, they don't want to play along. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8684.64s)]
*  And it's also because they would eventually get bored. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8688.28s)]
*  But no, if you sit in a classroom where you're 40, 50, 60 kids, [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8691.44s)]
*  the teacher is teaching you something that you don't either [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8697.16s)]
*  you don't quite understand or you're way ahead of this. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8700.04s)]
*  That's incredibly boring. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8702.84s)]
*  This tablet is actually challenging right on the level. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8704.199999999999s)]
*  And the beauty of this is that this is research that has actually been done [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8708.16s)]
*  in randomized controlled trial studies. Right. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8712.08s)]
*  So you've done with some kids, you gave them the tablets, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8713.84s)]
*  some kids who didn't give them tablets, then you see how much they differ. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8716.88s)]
*  And this matters because they not only learn more, [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8720.92s)]
*  but then they'll go out when they become adults [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8723.64s)]
*  and become much more productive in their societies. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8725.84s)]
*  So, again, one of the things that we try to do. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8728.519999999999s)]
*  So in that, you know, that big book I showed you that I was in development [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8730.560000000001s)]
*  that we did that with with 50 teams of economists and several noble lords [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8734.44s)]
*  and trying to find out, you know, of all the different things in the world. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8739.6s)]
*  What could we do? [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8742.44s)]
*  But that's a very long book. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8743.800000000001s)]
*  You can't get most politicians to read it. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8744.92s)]
*  So we actually did also a one pager. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8746.800000000001s)]
*  So I brought that one. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8749.08s)]
*  I'm hoping we can put that up. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8750.12s)]
*  So this this basically is the whole [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8751.640000000001s)]
*  this is the whole outline of all the stuff that we did. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8754.84s)]
*  This one pager is smartest targets for the world. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8757.88s)]
*  And what is this? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8761.839999999998s)]
*  So you should look at this this this out here on this one side. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8762.96s)]
*  It has all the different things you can do for the world. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8767.24s)]
*  So this this has come about with a lot of complicated stuff. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8770.4s)]
*  And basically, there's a graph that we can see online of this. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8774.199999999999s)]
*  Yes. Oh, sorry. Yes, there is. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8777.279999999999s)]
*  Because I can barely read this. Yes. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8779.16s)]
*  Very good point. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8781.839999999998s)]
*  Social, economic and environmental benefits for every dollar to find. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8782.599999999999s)]
*  How can we direct people to it? [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8787.48s)]
*  So we'll put up the link on if that's OK. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8788.88s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of graphs, buddy. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8792.88s)]
*  Yes. Sorry about that. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8795.52s)]
*  So basically what it shows is all the different things you can do for the world. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8797.88s)]
*  And then the line shows [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8801.68s)]
*  the length of the line shows how much bang for your buck. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8804.24s)]
*  OK. And so if it's a long line, it's a great idea. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8807.48s)]
*  OK. Sorry. Yes. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8810.72s)]
*  So here it goes. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8812.56s)]
*  So what's the best bang for your buck? [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8814.76s)]
*  So trade trade restrictions reduce world trade restrictions. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8816.72s)]
*  If we actually got much more free trade, that would make everyone [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8820.88s)]
*  incredibly much richer. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8824.96s)]
*  Sorry, there is in my slides, there is a better version that you can show online [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8827.679999999998s)]
*  on the last slide on Lomborg a. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8832.76s)]
*  So 51. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8837.24s)]
*  Kind of better. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8844.76s)]
*  Yeah, because it's at least not as long, right? [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8845.48s)]
*  It fits this format. OK. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8849.32s)]
*  So basically, you know, if you if you if you spend money [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8851.24s)]
*  and basically in order to get free trade, you need to pay off the world's rich farmers. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8855.16s)]
*  But you will get an enormous amount of growth in in in the economy. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8859.96s)]
*  Freer regional Asia, Pacific trade. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8864.92s)]
*  So trade seems to be the biggest one. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8867.56s)]
*  That's one of the biggest ones. Yes. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8869.76s)]
*  And then universal access to contraception. Yeah. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8871.68s)]
*  So that's basically the idea. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8875.16s)]
*  If you get more contraception, it means two things. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8876.52s)]
*  It partly means that women give fewer births and that means they die less. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8880.96s)]
*  It also means that each kid that then gets born [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8885.52s)]
*  will get more attention from their from their parents [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8888.64s)]
*  because there will be slightly fewer kids and they will have more [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8891.68s)]
*  capital available to them. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8896.88s)]
*  That means they become more productive and that means the economy will grow more. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8899.48s)]
*  This is what's typically called the the. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8903.68s)]
*  Well, I think we should go. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8909.240000000002s)]
*  That's OK. I don't think we should go over this in charge forever. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8910.240000000002s)]
*  But the idea is that there's a lot of things that we can do for the world [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8912.720000000001s)]
*  that have great bang for the buck. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8917.240000000002s)]
*  And climate is one of them, but it's just one of them. Right. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8918.800000000001s)]
*  And if you think this is the end of the world, you think that's the only thing [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8921.880000000001s)]
*  we should be discussing. I mean, I've heard some people say, you know, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8925.800000000001s)]
*  if we only have till 2030, you know, we've got to do everything for climate. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8928.720000000001s)]
*  Then, you know, there'll still be poor people in 2030. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8932.56s)]
*  We can help. I just think it's so, you know, short [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8935.0s)]
*  time patronize patronizing. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8938.56s)]
*  Because clearly we both want to fix climate change [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8940.48s)]
*  and fix all these other problems in the world. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8943.6s)]
*  And we can do that, but only if we spend money smartly. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8946.039999999999s)]
*  So we let's spend the money smartly on climate and research and development. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8949.16s)]
*  But let's also spend money on getting tablets into the educational system, [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8953.039999999999s)]
*  making sure we deal with tuberculosis, malaria, malnutrition. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8957.88s)]
*  There's lots of other things where we for very little money [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8961.52s)]
*  can make an enormous amount of benefit. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8964.48s)]
*  Well, I think that's the most important part of your message is it's not just [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8966.32s)]
*  this idea that climate change is kind of being overblown. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8969.6s)]
*  It's a very terrifying prospect, but there's a lot of issues to deal with. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8972.720000000001s)]
*  That's great. I really appreciate that. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8977.6s)]
*  And I think that we need more of that, more of a balanced, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8979.720000000001s)]
*  nuanced perspective on all of our issues. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8982.6s)]
*  I'm glad you brought up education as well and all those other things, [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8985.08s)]
*  contraception and poverty. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8987.560000000001s)]
*  And yeah, there's a lot going on there that we need to think about as well. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8989.8s)]
*  Yeah. And if we start doing that, it can also be a real lift [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8994.16s)]
*  for for a lot of these people who are terrified. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=8997.56s)]
*  Remember, if you ask people in the in the rich world, [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9000.88s)]
*  do you think the world's civilization is going to come to an end? [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9004.08s)]
*  60 percent now are saying they think it's likely or very likely [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9007.4s)]
*  that humanity is going to end. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9011.92s)]
*  That's petrifying. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9013.64s)]
*  And that's just not what's going to happen. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9015.199999999999s)]
*  And they think this is because of climate change. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9016.72s)]
*  They think it's because of climate change. Right. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9018.36s)]
*  So we can actually both liberate ourselves and realize, yeah, problem. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9020.12s)]
*  Not the end of the world. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9023.32s)]
*  And then also start talking about all these other issues [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9024.2s)]
*  and make sure that we actually leave this planet, [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9026.68s)]
*  not just a little bit better, but a lot better. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9029.0s)]
*  I love your message. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9031.68s)]
*  Thank you, Bjorn. That was really great. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9032.84s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I81A6sG7IUU&t=9034.92s)]
