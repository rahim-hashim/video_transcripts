# Joe Rogan Experience #2180 - Jordan Peterson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_3yOQl9E4I)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Messes up my hair.
*  Good to see you.
*  What's going on your coat today?
*  Every day is a new one.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I've got this suit maker, L.G.F.G., Dimitri, the crazy Russian, and he, you know,
*  pays attention to what I'm doing and makes me the suits that he thinks are suitable,
*  and I wear them.
*  You've gotten quite extravagant though.
*  Like sometimes like one half of the suit is one color.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you're getting bored.
*  You just want to switch it up a lot.
*  He sends me these damn things and I get them and I think, there's no way I'll wear that.
*  There's no way I'll wear that.
*  And then I put it on, I think, I like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And Tammy puts up with it.
*  So is it everyday suits now with you?
*  I'm in a suit pretty much all the time.
*  Is there a reason for that?
*  Well the original reason was because probably because my father, he was a teacher and he
*  always wore a suit even in the 70s when that started to become, you know, like 1950s thing.
*  I asked him one time why he did that and he said it was to show respect for his students.
*  And then when I was a professor, well, when you start to be a professor, you're not that
*  much difference in age from your students to begin with.
*  It's a good way of laying out a demarcation.
*  And that was helpful.
*  That's useful.
*  You know, people like to know how the hierarchies are delineated.
*  Professors like to think that they're everybody's buddy, but that's not the right relationship.
*  And so that was helpful.
*  And then when I went on tour in 2018, you know, I realized that I was going to speak
*  live in front of several hundred thousand people over the course of the tour.
*  And I thought, you got to think when you have an opportunity like that, that if you had
*  the least amount of sense, you'd pull out all the stops.
*  So I bought some expensive suits.
*  And then one of the things that happened in consequence of that was that people started
*  to come to the lectures in suits.
*  And so about I'd say about 40 percent of the audience dresses formally.
*  And lots of the young guys who come, they tell me when I meet them afterwards in the
*  meet and greets, for example, that they bought their first suit to come to the lectures.
*  And so, you know, I wouldn't have ever expected that.
*  And then Dimitri showed up about two years ago with this portfolio of suits.
*  He designed one for each of the rules for my first book.
*  And he put the rule underneath the collar at the back and designed the lining, custom
*  lining on all the suits as well.
*  So I gave him a crack at it because he put so much work into it and that worked out real
*  well.
*  He's very, very creative.
*  Yeah, that two-colour suit, there's lamb's wool on one side and goat's wool on the other.
*  And it's a heaven and hell suit.
*  So, yeah, no kidding.
*  This is covered with iconography, Christian or Catholic and Orthodox.
*  I've got one of each and that's because I was out on tour with my new book for my new
*  book which is called We Who Wrestle with God, which we will talk about today, I hope.
*  So that's the suit story, man.
*  How does one wrestle with God?
*  Do you wrestle with God?
*  With every word.
*  So what does that mean?
*  Well, look, man, well, you know, look, here, part of the reason that you're so successful,
*  in my opinion, is because you actually say what you think.
*  Like you're not putting on a show.
*  Actually, you have no reason to put on a show.
*  You put on a whole bunch of shows and they've already been successful.
*  You know, and you're actually asking the questions that are genuine questions and people can
*  trust you because of that.
*  And that means that you're letting the words emerge as they come to you.
*  And each of, doing that with each word, that's a decision, you know, because you can use
*  your language to manipulate and you can use your language to, for your own, say, hedonistic
*  purposes or to gain power.
*  Or you can just say what you think.
*  Every like all of those different choices are a decision.
*  That's a wrestling.
*  That's a moral decision.
*  And it shines in every word.
*  And so it's super important.
*  That's part of the reason why in the Christian canon, the word is the basis of reality, right?
*  That's the force that, it's the process that generates the order that's good out of possibility
*  and chaos.
*  Right?
*  And so that's, and Israel, the word Israel means we who wrestle with God.
*  So that's the chosen people.
*  And so what that means at a deeper level even is that if you're genuinely wrestling with
*  your conscience, then you're someone who's chosen by God.
*  I think that's right.
*  That's accurate.
*  It's interesting what you just said.
*  One of Terrence McKenna's lectures, he talked about a very profound psychedelic experience
*  that he had where he was given this revelation that the world is made out of words.
*  That everything is made out of words.
*  He had some sort of profound understanding of what words really mean.
*  Well, how much of the reality that surrounds you has been, what would you say, has emerged
*  out of the realm of possibility because of what you've said?
*  A lot.
*  And you have this huge influence on the world that's all a consequence, all, almost all
*  a consequence of what you've said.
*  And so there's an insistence in the Judeo-Christian canon that whatever, that the capacity that
*  words have to shape possibility is akin or identical to the process that generates reality
*  itself.
*  And I think that's true.
*  That's why in the opening chapters of Genesis we're described as formulated in the image
*  of God.
*  We're like a microcosm of the process that gives rise to order itself.
*  It's a very different view than the bottom-up materialistic view, let's say, of the Enlightenment
*  in the scientific world.
*  It's a different way of looking at things.
*  It's the notion that what is in front of you is a field of indeterminate possibility.
*  It's got some implicit structure, as the scientists insist, but it's open and you grapple with
*  it like you grapple with your dawning consciousness in the morning.
*  What confronts you in the morning is a field of possibility, and you approach that with
*  a certain kind of orientation.
*  And you use your words and your linguistic capacity to think to shape that possibility.
*  And if you do that properly, then you make – this is the Genesis 1 insistence again
*  – you make the order that's good or very good.
*  And that depends on your orientation.
*  So in the Sermon on the Mount, for example, which is an instruction manual, Christ tells
*  his listeners how to orient themselves in the world properly.
*  So he says first, aim with all your heart at the highest good you can imagine.
*  Now you'll get better at that as your vision clears, but that's the orientation.
*  To do what's right.
*  Now you might say, like Pontius Pilate said, well, what is right, what is truth?
*  But most people know the difference between right and wrong.
*  You know at least step by step what would move you forward and upward.
*  So you orient yourself to the highest possible upward place.
*  Then you make the assumption that other people have the same intrinsic value that you do.
*  So that's your initial aim and presumption.
*  And then you pay attention to the moment.
*  And that's, well, that's often the statement that gets Christ confused with the hippies,
*  you know, to consider the lilies of the field who don't toil or spin.
*  But that's not the instruction.
*  The instruction is to aim up with everything and then having that firmly in mind to pay
*  attention as much attention as you can to each moment to allow the words to come to
*  you that best suit that upward aim, not to subordinate your language to your own machinations
*  or manipulations or your own hedonistic desire, but towards what's right.
*  And if you do that, then what emerges out of possibility is akin to the garden, to
*  the original garden in Genesis 1.
*  And it's the order that's good.
*  Truthful language brings about the order that's good.
*  And that's, well, that's a very accurate way of portraying the role consciousness plays
*  in bringing about reality.
*  And that viewpoint, by the way, isn't limited to the Judeo-Christian canon.
*  You see the same thing in the Taoist representation, because in the Taoist world you have a domain
*  of order, that's the black serpent, and you have a domain of chaos.
*  Sorry, I have it reversed.
*  The domain of order is the white serpent, and the domain of chaos or possibility is
*  the black serpent in the Taoist image, the two snakes head to tail.
*  And your job is to walk the line between them.
*  You can tell when you're walking that line, because that's where things are maximally
*  meaningful.
*  And so that's another element of this vision, which is that if you orient yourself with
*  upward aim, and you straddle the line between order and chaos, then things become maximally
*  meaningful around you.
*  And Musk, you know, I just did a podcast with Elon Musk, and he talked about resolving his
*  existential crisis, the existential crisis that he experienced when he was about 11 or
*  12.
*  It was a crisis of faith, essentially.
*  And the way that he resolved that and then motivated himself so intensely was by understanding
*  that if he pursued the path of the expansion of knowledge, that that would be intrinsically
*  meaningful.
*  That's the path of growth, that's the path of adventure, all of that.
*  It's aligned with what matures you and makes you more responsible and sets the world in
*  order.
*  And the instinct of meaning signifies all that.
*  And so I've written a lot about that in this new book, We Who Wrestle with God, and that's
*  what I've been lecturing about in 60 different cities, walking through these biblical stories
*  one by one, partly because we have this wrestling match going on in our culture, let's say,
*  between the nihilists and the atheists and the true believers, you might say.
*  And one of the faults of that war is that no one stops to elucidate or delineate exactly
*  what it is that we're arguing about.
*  So you have people like Dawkins, they parody the traditional conceptions of God, a superstitious
*  being, nothing more than a defense against death, anxiety, or the opiate of the masses,
*  the old man in the sky.
*  The conceptualization of God in the Old Testament and the New Testament is unbelievably sophisticated.
*  And to reduce it to that kind of parody is a stunning disservice.
*  Dawkins is an odd duck.
*  He's an odd duck because I think he knows also that there is some value in psychedelic
*  experiences but he's scared to have them.
*  He won't look through Galileo's telescope.
*  But he's had major health crises, didn't he have some sort of a stroke or something like
*  that?
*  I don't know.
*  I believe he did.
*  I believe he had a major health crisis.
*  It's like, how much time do you have left?
*  What are you going to do?
*  Are you going to just not try it forever?
*  Are you just going to dismiss everything forever?
*  I feel like people that dismiss things like that, this reductionist perspective, you're
*  essentially saying you have the answers.
*  And to dismiss the whole question of God or of whatever you want to call it, higher power,
*  a creator of the universe, the universe itself as a conscious entity, whatever it is, to
*  dismiss it just because you're trying to decipher the writings of fairly comparatively unsophisticated
*  people because we're talking about people from many, many thousands of years ago without
*  access to the information we have today.
*  And then you're also dealing with the fact that many of these stories were of an oral
*  tradition for over a thousand years before they were ever written down.
*  So to just dismiss that as superstition and silliness without any curiosity about the
*  root of these things, why they resonate with people, and to just say that this is superstitious
*  nonsense that people choose to believe in, and this reductionist perspective of the known
*  reality that we currently exist in.
*  It's a foolish way of interfacing with something.
*  It's shocking when an obviously brilliant man has a foolish way of interfacing with
*  a very complex situation.
*  Well, it's especially odd in his case because he's also the formulator of the idea of meme.
*  And a religious story is a meme that's been selected by time and crowd.
*  That's a good way of thinking about it.
*  It strikes to the heart of the matter in ways that are sophisticated beyond conscious understanding.
*  Can I tell you a story?
*  Sure.
*  Okay.
*  It's a good story for the psychedelic experience, perhaps, at least as an analogue.
*  So in the story of Exodus, there's a number of circumstances under which Moses has an
*  encounter with God.
*  And they're very useful stories to understand because they point you to how that can make
*  itself manifest in your own life.
*  So the first real encounter that Moses has with God is in the story of the burning bush.
*  And by this time, Moses is an adult.
*  He's left his home.
*  He's gone out and he's got married.
*  He's apprenticed as a shepherd, which was a very, very hard job in those days because
*  shepherds not only had to protect the weakest and serve them, but also keep the lions and
*  the wolves at bay by themselves out in the wilderness.
*  It was a very hard job.
*  And Moses has mastered this.
*  So he's grown up and he's adopted a role that's like a standard social role.
*  You know, he's a husband, he's a shepherd, he's an adult.
*  Okay.
*  And so kudos to him.
*  But then one day he's out in the wilderness by the Holy Mountain.
*  I think it's Horeb in that story, but the Holy Mountain is always the place where heaven
*  and earth touch.
*  And so there are all sorts of transformation stories that occur in the biblical accounts
*  at Mount Horeb or at Mount Sinai where God and earth meet.
*  And he's out near the Holy Mountain and something attracts his attention and he goes off the
*  beaten path to investigate.
*  Okay, so that's the first thing, that's the first bit of wisdom to derive from the story.
*  You'll have your role and you should have your role as a socialized adult, right?
*  So you're kind of a type that way, maybe even a cookie cutter type, but you've adopted
*  this mature social role.
*  It doesn't make you a full individual, but it's better than being immature and staying
*  in your father's tent, for example, which is what Abraham does until he's very old.
*  So something attracts Moses' attention and he goes off to investigate.
*  Okay, so and then he sees that it's a burning bush.
*  And so what's a burning bush?
*  Well, it's the tree of life and life is often represented as a branching tree.
*  And it's on fire because it's compelling, because fire is compelling and fire is alive.
*  And it's a symbol of life because everything that is alive burns.
*  That's what metabolism is.
*  And so a burning bush is like life itself intensified to the ultimate degree.
*  And that's what attracts Moses' attention.
*  And he gets closer and closer to it, which means he investigates more and more deeply.
*  And as he investigates more deeply, he starts to understand that he's nearing the depths.
*  He's on sacred ground.
*  He takes off his shoes.
*  And that's an indication of his willingness to transform in identity.
*  And he continues to investigate.
*  And then the voice of being itself speaks to him from the depths.
*  And it tells him that it reveals itself to him as the ground of being itself.
*  And it transforms him into the leader who invites his people away from slavery and who
*  stands up against tyranny.
*  And so that's the story of Moses' baptism.
*  And so what does that mean for the ordinary person?
*  Well, it means that you need to grow up and adopt a role.
*  You need to mature.
*  You need to become an adult.
*  You need to be a good man in your time.
*  But then you have to pay attention to see what attracts your attention, what calls to
*  you, because there's an autonomy about that, right?
*  You don't get to pick what interests you.
*  It picks you.
*  And you can respond to that call and investigate or reject it.
*  Those are your options.
*  And if you reject it, you stay in your box.
*  But if you follow it, something will call to you.
*  And then if you investigate that, that will transform you.
*  And if you investigate it deeply enough, it'll transform you into the person who can stand
*  up against tyranny and who can lead his people away from slavery.
*  And that's how God is defined in that story.
*  God is the thing that calls to you to take you out of your role that will shape the manner
*  in which your psyche transforms itself as a consequence of your diligent investigation
*  into what calls to you.
*  And so that's the God that's portrayed.
*  That's one image of the God that's portrayed in the Old Testament.
*  Are you aware of some of the more recent work that's been done by scholars in Israel where
*  these guys have now come up with this hypothesis that the burning bush was actually, it was
*  a DMT experience.
*  And that the burning bush was most likely an acacia tree.
*  That the acacia tree is apparently rich with DMT.
*  And they think, you know, the way you get a DMT experience is you smoke it, right?
*  And that they had some method of achieving psychedelic states through this.
*  And this is where Moses is encountering God.
*  Well we have one of the things-
*  I know about the theorizing and it's certainly the case that people have been using psychedelic
*  experiences for we don't know how long.
*  Hundreds of thousands of years, no doubt.
*  And they've had a profound cultural consequence.
*  One of the things that a psychedelic experience does is amplify that sense of intrinsic interest.
*  So it strips your perceptions of their inhibition by memory.
*  That's a good way of thinking about it.
*  So that you see what's there instead of your habits of perception.
*  And so it's a way of amplifying, you could think of it as a way of amplifying what's
*  represented in the biblical corpus as a calling.
*  And the thing that's odd about the calling, well you know, when you're- you can think
*  about it this way.
*  When you're laying out a podcast, when you're participating in a podcast, you're following
*  a golden thread, right?
*  You're following where your interest takes you and your curiosity takes you.
*  And that's not something you can pre-plan, right?
*  It's something that happens in the moment.
*  So imagine that you're focused on your goal of having the most interesting conversation
*  possible and communicating what's derived to the broadest number of people.
*  So that's the overarching goal.
*  Okay, now you focus on the moment and a spirit arises within you.
*  That's a good way of thinking about it.
*  That's the logos.
*  Spirit arises within you that leads you on a pathway that's an investigation into the
*  truth.
*  That's part of that calling.
*  The psychedelic chemicals, they heighten that, they heighten the manifestation of the underlying
*  mystery.
*  That's another way of thinking about it.
*  They do that neurochemically.
*  And so now what's the association between that and religious revelation in the Bible?
*  We don't know.
*  We don't know.
*  Have you read any of Marco Allegro's stuff?
*  No, no, no.
*  John Marco Allegro wrote a book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross?
*  Oh yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I read that back, oh my God, 1974.
*  So you probably read it before it was bought up by the Catholic Church.
*  Oh, I didn't even know about that.
*  Yeah, it was bought up by the, like you used to have to get old copies of it if you wanted
*  to buy it.
*  And then it was recently republished.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  I read that a long, long time ago.
*  I had no idea what to make of it.
*  When I read it, I thought, oh, huh, I have no idea what to do with this.
*  It's a problem because to really understand what he's saying, you'd have to have a deep
*  understanding of those ancient languages.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yeah, it's a very difficult book to evaluate.
*  Because there's very few people that are even qualified to, like many people have disputed
*  some of his, like he has one claim that the word Christ can be traced etymologically,
*  how do you say it?
*  Etymologically to an ancient Sumerian word that means a mushroom covered in God's semen.
*  And so it was his assertion that the idea was that they thought when it rained that
*  rain was the giver of life and it was literally God's semen that made things grow and that
*  these mushrooms, because they would show up so quickly, you know, if it rains, if you
*  go to bed, you could look out at just your lawn and it's complete grass, not a mushroom
*  and you can go to bed and then wake up in the morning, there'll be big mushrooms there.
*  It's really weird.
*  And that these things when they would eat the psilocybin mushrooms that would appear
*  out of nowhere, they genuinely were referring to them as God, that this was like a gift
*  from God and that that was tracing back to the origin of the word Christ.
*  But it's very tortured, like to really understand and to be able to dispute it.
*  You'd have to have a deep understanding of Aramaic.
*  You'd have to have a deep understanding of Aramaic.
*  You'd have to have a deep understanding of the original doctrines.
*  Like what is the actual translation?
*  What does it mean?
*  You'd have to understand the ancient Hebrew version of it.
*  How does it differ?
*  All the webs of associations.
*  Oh God, it's so crazy.
*  When we read it in English, I mean, what was the original version?
*  The original version, all the ancient letters in ancient Hebrew also doubled as numbers,
*  right?
*  So words had numerical value, like the word God and the word love apparently have the
*  same numerical value.
*  That is a bizarre concept for us to try to wrap our heads around a language, which you
*  know that words also have numbers in them, that your letters also mean numbers, and that
*  there's value, certain numerical value to certain words, and that you would use them
*  in the context of these conversations you would understand.
*  Where I don't understand, I don't have that.
*  I have English.
*  It's like we have math, we have language.
*  They're separate, and you're missing something in what they're trying to say.
*  So what John Marco Alegro is doing, he's taking the oldest version of these stories on record,
*  right?
*  He's taking the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  He's taking stuff that's literally written on animal skins, and one of the ways that
*  they deciphered it to try to put it all together, they had to take the DNA samples of these
*  parchments to try to figure out which ones are from which cows, if they're from different
*  cows.
*  And that's part of the way they figured out how to put all the stuff together.
*  This guy studies this for 14 years, and he was the only ordained minister that was a
*  part of this deciphering committee.
*  I think there was 14 people.
*  I don't remember how many people.
*  It might have been 20, but it was the only one of them that was agnostic.
*  So he had become, when he had started studying theology, he kind of lost his faith apparently.
*  You know, he started realizing there's so many versions of these stories that are coming
*  from different places.
*  He became sort of like, hey, I think I'm agnostic.
*  I'm just going to like step back and have this approach of not knowing, not having a
*  doctrine, not having an ideology that I'm attached to myself to.
*  And so then when he goes through all of this, this is a straight lay scientist, by the way.
*  It's not like some guy looking for psychedelics to be a part of everything.
*  It's a very serious book.
*  Right.
*  And there's a lot of those people that are doing that.
*  They're looking for psychedelics to be a part of everything, sort of to validate or justify
*  their own use of these things.
*  He wasn't doing that at all.
*  You know, and he wasn't like Watson, where a guy who went down and experienced the psychedelic
*  experiences in Mexico and then came back and described them for mainstream literature.
*  This guy was doing it like a scholar.
*  His whole purpose was just to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls.
*  But it was so compelling to him when it was over.
*  He like had to break ranks and he had to write this book.
*  And then they they took that book out of circulation, I believe.
*  Find out what happened with the sacred mushroom in the cross, how it was because he published
*  another book shortly afterwards that was the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth.
*  And I think it felt to me when I read that one, it's almost like he has to write a book
*  because they took the other one away because it's kind of like saying most of the same
*  stuff.
*  But he believed that it was that what they were writing about a lot of it was fertility
*  rituals and psychedelic experiences and that he would that they were hiding a lot of these
*  stories like they're hiding the knowledge underneath these stories to try to in parables
*  and all these different ways to try to obscure it from the Romans and obscure it from the
*  people that conquer them so they wouldn't know the secrets of this thing, this ritual
*  in which they would experience God.
*  So why is it that psychedelic use has played the role that it's played in your interests
*  and your pursuit of knowledge?
*  What do you think it's done for you that's been valuable?
*  I think we're in a weird place in society where the term drug is a blanket and it covers
*  things that have vastly different effects.
*  It covers caffeine, it covers nicotine, and it covers dimethyltryptamine, which is crazy.
*  It's crazy that all those things are drugs.
*  Adderall is a drug.
*  Zanix, there's a million of them.
*  They're all different and they're all drugs.
*  And the idea that psychedelics are a drug, for lack of a better term, that's what we
*  use.
*  I don't think that's what they are at all.
*  I think they are probably why we became people.
*  I think they are probably why society advanced.
*  And I think every great ancient culture probably celebrated them and used them.
*  It seems like there's so much evidence out of Egypt of the use of psilocybin, various
*  different drugs, various different psychedelic experiences.
*  The iconography of the pineal gland seems to be a big part of multiple cultures, not
*  just Egyptian, but even Catholicism.
*  If you go to the Vatican, there's this enormous pine cone that is a statue there.
*  And I was very lucky when I went to the Vatican.
*  We got a guide.
*  We hired a private guide that was a scholar from France.
*  When he's not working on the summers, he gives these tours and they're very thorough.
*  And he was a brilliant guy.
*  Wish I could remember his name.
*  I should probably find it out to give him credit.
*  Brilliant guy.
*  So he takes us through showing us all this artwork.
*  It's incredible.
*  He's explaining why they had little penises and he's explaining the whole thing, that
*  big penises were thought to be barbaric and it was not representative of somewhat of class
*  and dignity and education.
*  So we get to this pine cone and he says to me, he goes, do you know what this represents?
*  And I said, is it the pineal gland?
*  And he goes, yes.
*  And then we start this conversation of why these Catholics would have this enormous representation
*  of the pineal gland, which they reference as the seed of the soul.
*  And that this gland, which is in the center of your brain, is thought to be literally
*  a third eye and on reptiles, it actually has a cornea and a lens, this gland.
*  Like literally, it's exactly where the third eye of Eastern mysticism is.
*  And they've got a representation of it right here.
*  And it's thought to be where dimethyltryptamine is produced.
*  And this whole connection to it is so old that it seems like you go back to the John
*  Marco Olegra stuff, you go back to the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are the oldest version
*  of the Bible, the only version that I believe the only version they have in Aramaic of all
*  those stories.
*  And if he's right, if John Marco Olegra was right, it all kind of makes sense that these
*  people were having these experiences much like the Greeks were with the Illusinian mysteries,
*  much like multiple different cultures in the Amazon, all over the world have experienced
*  these profound ceremony experiences that lead to these journeys into the spirit world, these
*  connections with higher consciousness, this something that when you're experiencing it
*  seems very, very real, but also very preposterous when you try to explain it to people that
*  aren't experienced.
*  You know, it's like Hendrix, like, are you experienced?
*  Have you ever been experienced?
*  Well, I have.
*  It's that, like, with that understanding that that's possible, the world changes, because
*  now you know that that's possible.
*  You could live your whole life and not know that the most shocking, profound thing in
*  existence is three hits away, three hits away.
*  And all of a sudden you're in a completely different universe in 20, 30 seconds.
*  That's nuts.
*  The fact that that is dismissed, that people look at it as like, oh, you're just escaping
*  reality and you're like, it might be the source of civilization itself.
*  It might be the source of language.
*  It might be the source of the expansion of the human mind over a period of two million
*  years, the doubling of the human brain over a period of two million years, which Terence
*  directly coincides with the shifting of the tropical rainforest turning into grasslands,
*  which would force these primates to experiment with new food sources and these undulate cows
*  that were everywhere that would shit.
*  And then these psilocybin mushrooms would grow and they're shit.
*  Observed primates flipping over these cow patties looking for beetles and grubs and
*  things to eat.
*  It's everywhere.
*  Like, you could see it all over Africa.
*  If there's something on that, they're going to try it out.
*  And if these things are trying it out and they're doing this over a period of two million
*  years and they develop language and culture and weapons and they start thinking about
*  things and they become different than every animal around them.
*  And this was McKenna's stone-dape theory, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
*  And Dennis McKenna, who is a legitimate scientist, Dennis explains it even better because he
*  explains it with the actual mechanisms that your brain, the things that fire up when you
*  encounter high dose psilocybin experiences that would lead you to the development of
*  language.
*  Glossolalia, the connection of sounds and objects and bringing things together in a
*  manner of communication.
*  Also, they realize that in low doses it increases visual acuity.
*  It makes people more amorous, makes people hornier.
*  They're going to have more sex.
*  They're going to be better hunters because they could see better.
*  They're going to be a little more sensitive to the environment.
*  They're going to be more aware.
*  Edge detection is different.
*  There's like so many different things that happen that if you're thinking about what
*  made people people, it's a mystery.
*  We want to pretend that we understand things because of the fossil record and this and
*  that.
*  Sure, we kind of understand.
*  But every now and then we find a new human that we didn't even know exists like Dennis
*  Ovens.
*  What was that?
*  Not even 20 years ago, I don't think.
*  So now there's a whole other branch of human beings that they weren't even aware of 20
*  years ago.
*  Whatever the fuck happened that took us from all the other primates that are still here
*  and made us this, it's pretty profound.
*  And I have a feeling that psychedelics were at least involved in that process.
*  That's my belief.
*  My belief is that the sweeping psychedelics act of 1970 that they passed essentially to
*  target civil rights activists and anti-war activists.
*  That's what they did.
*  They wanted to go after the hippies and they went after the hippies with MK Ultra, with
*  Tom O'Neill so brilliantly outlines in his book Chaos.
*  They went after it and they created the Manson family.
*  They created that family.
*  They taught that guy how to do that so that that guy would kill people and he would be
*  a psychopath and now hippies would be psychopaths.
*  And then all this anti-war shit would just get stopped by sensible people.
*  Then schedule oneed everything.
*  Everything.
*  Psyllicide and marijuana all down the board.
*  Everything becomes schedule one.
*  The most illegal of illegal things.
*  So all these people who are experienced, all these Ken Kesey people and all the LSD people
*  of the 60s, all those people become criminals instantly.
*  And they just threw water on the whole movement and it worked.
*  It really worked.
*  It was Nixon and all the people that were in charge back then.
*  If you look at what happened from 1960 to 1980, this confusing era of the 70s where
*  the effects are wearing off and then you get into the 80s and everybody's doing coke and
*  they have makeup on and they have big hair and the music sucks.
*  It's like something happened.
*  Something happened.
*  What happened was they completely removed the very thing that had changed culture so
*  radically from the 50s to the 60s.
*  I'm a gigantic fan of 1960s automobiles.
*  I love them.
*  There's something about the shapes of them, the way they sound.
*  Part of it is that I grew up in the 80s and those are the cars we all wanted.
*  When we were kids, if a guy drove by in a 1969 Camaro, we would all be like, whoa, look
*  at it.
*  Look at that thing.
*  But there's something about those shapes.
*  There's something about the designs of those cars that resonate so strongly today.
*  A 1990 car ain't worth shit.
*  Nobody wants your fucking 1990 car.
*  1990 Camaro, get the fuck out of here with that thing.
*  But if you have a 1968 Camaro, people will stop in a parking lot and stare at it.
*  What is that?
*  I think those guys were on drugs.
*  I think all those guys were on drugs.
*  I think the guy who created a Corvette had to be on drugs.
*  These guys felt something the same way Hendrix felt something when he was on stage playing
*  guitar in a way nobody had ever heard before.
*  That guy came out of nowhere and everybody was like, what the fuck is he doing?
*  It was so different that Eric Clapton watched him for the first time and was like, I should
*  quit playing guitar.
*  Like, what the fuck am I doing compared to this guy?
*  Like Jesus Christ, everybody was like humbled and confused by it.
*  Psychedelic inspired 100%.
*  One hundred percent.
*  And there's something about throwing water on that in the 1970s that I think has done
*  a massive disservice to our civilization, a massive disservice, because it's equated
*  these things with people that have poor discipline and bad social skills and ne'er do wells
*  who fail in society.
*  And that's not true.
*  So in all these people that I know that are billionaires, I know people that are like
*  super rich people that run these financial institutions.
*  And I know a lot of like brilliant venture capitalist guys and brilliant tech guys.
*  And almost all of them are enthusiasts.
*  Almost all of them have had these experiences and they're all kind of quiet about it.
*  And it's very unfortunate.
*  It's very unfortunate because of these stupid laws that were passed 50 years ago, we've
*  gotten ourselves in this weird crunch where we've made things illegal that could massively
*  help people progress in life and sort things out if we could figure out how to manage them
*  correctly.
*  Should we run proper studies about what is the correct dose?
*  Is there a person that has a certain sort of biological makeup that makes these drugs
*  problematic?
*  Should we find out who's, maybe someone's allergic to them.
*  There's many medications and many different compounds and many plants and natural things
*  that people are allergic to.
*  Let's avoid that.
*  Let's try to figure out what works for some people, what doesn't work.
*  Let's have legitimate counselors that could guide people through experiences.
*  People that have experienced it themselves and can understand how to do this with intent
*  and possibly aid your life.
*  They have been shown to be hugely beneficial for soldiers, for our military men and women
*  coming back from overseas experiencing horrific trauma to help them get past that.
*  And yet they're illegal still.
*  We're both middle-aged men, right?
*  So who is telling us what we can and can't do?
*  This is preposterous.
*  This is other men our age that haven't had these experiences maintaining this control
*  on them in a completely ignorant way.
*  They don't even know what they are.
*  They don't know what these things are.
*  They don't know what the experience is.
*  And yet they want it to be kept out of the hands of kids.
*  We've got to keep it off the streets.
*  We've got to keep drugs away from our society.
*  And you don't know what you're talking about.
*  It might be why we're here.
*  And it also, the absence of it, might be why we're so fucked up.
*  It might be why we're so disconnected, why we're so disjointed.
*  And our society is so hypocritical.
*  The most pro-life people are also pro-death penalty.
*  It's like across the board, everything.
*  The people that want no crime but don't want to stop the emergence of crime by funding
*  programs to try to fix the inner cities.
*  Our whole thing is disconnected.
*  And I have a feeling that a big part of that is that we have not been given access to tools
*  that have helped people literally become what we are today.
*  And if you read Brian Murrow, Rescue's work, and if he's correct, and these people that
*  are studying the hallucinian mysteries and the literal emergence of democracy as we know
*  it, probably all of it came out of psychedelic experiences.
*  So I had Timothy Leary's old job at Harvard.
*  That comes with a lot of weight.
*  Yeah, and I knew some of the people that knew him.
*  And so you could say that what happened in the 1960s, and this is relevant to the psychedelic
*  experience, let's say, is that the emergence of mushrooms in particular, and then LSD,
*  indicated to a swath of the population like Leary and like Ken Casey that our perceptions
*  were locked in kind of a box, in a box that we weren't even conscious of.
*  I suppose that's the box of conformity.
*  And the psychedelics released a wave of nonconformity.
*  And Leary crystallized that with his tune in, turn on, and drop out.
*  Now there was a major problem with that, and that was partly what led to the kickback.
*  So you might say that the first stage of something approximating a religious revelation is the
*  understanding that your perceptions have been constrained by forms of conformity that were
*  so extensive that you didn't even understand them.
*  You didn't even know they were there.
*  And so you're freed from that.
*  And then maybe the first response to that is the celebration of an unlimited hedonistic
*  freedom.
*  But the problem with that is that freedom from constraint and hedonism is not freedom.
*  It's just subjugation to a kind of instinctive chaos.
*  And that emerged with the hippie culture.
*  And Leary in particular made a huge mistake when he said tune in, turn on, and drop out.
*  He should have said tune in, turn on, and grow up.
*  I'm dead serious about that, because there's a different form of responsibility that emerges
*  once you realize that you were constrained by a conformist box, let's say like Moses
*  when he was being a normal shepherd, that you can step outside of that.
*  But you don't step outside of that into worship of the golden calf like in hedonistic orgies.
*  You step outside of that with a more conscious upward aim.
*  And if the use of transformative technologies like psychedelics isn't accompanied by that
*  framework of enhanced responsibility, then it can degenerate into a kind of hedonistic
*  chaos.
*  And that's what the Nixon types were reacting to.
*  They were terrified by it.
*  And they had the reasons to be terrified, because as you're intimating, these technologies
*  are unbelievably potent and destabilizing.
*  Now that destabilization can be used for better or for worse, and it should be used for better.
*  That's complex.
*  It's a very complex thing to manage.
*  And so Carl Jung said that one of the main functions of religion was to stop people from
*  having religious experiences.
*  And what he meant by that was that a direct experience of the transcendent is enough to
*  shake you to the foundation and to destabilize not only you but your culture.
*  This is why there's another scene in the story of Exodus.
*  But could you explain further, like expand on what he was meaning by that?
*  But keep you from having religious experiences?
*  Well, if everybody goes their own enlightened way, let's say, there's no social cohesion.
*  There's no unity of purpose.
*  There's nothing but fragmentation.
*  And part of the danger of the hippie movement in the 1960s was a counter social fragmentation.
*  So you can imagine, things get so constrained that everybody's exactly the same, and that's
*  a complete totalitarian catastrophe.
*  But you can imagine the opposite catastrophe, which is that everyone's letting it all hang
*  out and doing their own thing.
*  And that's equally dangerous.
*  And so there's some balance in the middle.
*  Well, that's that balance between chaos and order that we were referring to earlier.
*  It's also an ignorance of the structure that's involved in maintaining a society.
*  Definitely.
*  You need discipline and people need to work to maintain the society that you enjoy to
*  be so free and to be a hippie.
*  Yeah, well, you can imagine that that complex social order can be maintained by something
*  like mindless obedience.
*  That's suboptimal.
*  What you'd really want is enlightened responsibility.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  That's a great way to put it.
*  Right.
*  That's a very hard thing to pull off, though, because it means that you have to leap out
*  of the box of social constraint, and you have to take the responsibility onto yourself.
*  Now that's a hell of a lot better if you can manage it, but that is definitely not what
*  Kesey or Leary, for example, were preaching to the masses.
*  But what you're saying is like an admirable thing that people should aspire to.
*  It's the best possible...
*  Yeah, it's the highest goal.
*  Let me give you another example of this, if you don't mind.
*  I'm going to use another biblical story.
*  Why are you biblicaling?
*  The lights are flickering behind you, almost like God is interacting with us.
*  There's spirits in the room, Jamie.
*  Have you noticed the light flickering?
*  If you haven't noticed it, keep an eye on it.
*  Hopefully they're the right spirits.
*  Well, I think they always are.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  So, in the story of Abraham, Abraham is a...
*  He's an old man when the story starts.
*  As soon as you start talking about Abraham, start flickering again.
*  It's going out, see?
*  It's one of my tricks, man.
*  I'm telling you, dude, it's never happened before.
*  This is wild.
*  So Abraham is like 70 years old when the story starts, and we don't know anything about him.
*  He's completely nondescript.
*  He's a case of failure to launch.
*  So he has rich parents, and he has everything he needs at hand.
*  So he can live the life of a satiated infant.
*  Like he's in the throes of what would you say, materialistic plenty.
*  Okay, and the voice of God comes to him.
*  But it's characterized in a very particular manner.
*  So God comes to Abraham as the call to adventure.
*  And that's a very useful thing to know.
*  So in the Moses story, God comes to Moses as that which attracts his interest and takes
*  him off the beaten path.
*  In the story of Abraham, God comes as the spear of adventure.
*  And God makes Abraham a deal.
*  It's a very specific deal, and it's the best possible deal.
*  This is the covenant, by the way.
*  This is the covenant.
*  So God tells Abraham, if you leave your zone of comfort, if you remove yourself from your
*  father's tent, if you move away from infantile materialistic satiation and go out into the
*  terrible world, and you do that voluntarily, you have the adventure of your life, this
*  is what will happen.
*  You'll be a blessing to yourself that's genuine.
*  So instead of being wracked with self-doubt and being self-conscious and taking yourself
*  apart with guilt and shame, you'll ride the wave of adventure and you'll feel that your
*  life is a blessing.
*  Not only will you feel that, it will be a blessing.
*  That's the first thing that will happen.
*  The second thing will happen is that other people will notice and your name will become
*  renowned and that will be valid.
*  You'll be a blessing to other people in that regard.
*  Your name will be upheld.
*  So you'll stand out among your peers but in a justifiable manner that's a consequence
*  of your own intrinsic merit.
*  The third thing that will happen is that you'll have the opportunity to establish something
*  permanent.
*  For Abraham, it's a dynasty, right?
*  He's offered the possibility of being the father of nations.
*  And the fourth thing that happens is you'll do it in a way that's of cardinal benefit
*  to everyone.
*  And so what happens in that story, this is so cool, it's so remarkable, it's the answer
*  to the selfish gene, by the way, as well.
*  So what this story does is it takes the call to adventure, which is the instinct that makes
*  children move out into the world.
*  It's the spirit that you encourage if you're a good father.
*  It lines that up and it says if you follow that and let it pull you out of your zone
*  of comfort, your life will be a blessing to you.
*  Your reputation will grow.
*  You'll establish something permanent and you'll do that in a way that's good for everyone,
*  right?
*  So that's a hell of a good deal.
*  And that's the story of Abraham.
*  Okay, so why is that relevant to the psychedelic debate?
*  Because if you're going to move into the razon of the transcendent, you have to take on the
*  requisite responsibility or the process of transcendence turns into something like a
*  descent into unstructured chaos.
*  And that's not an improvement.
*  It's just a movement from tyranny into the desert.
*  That's a good way of thinking about it symbolically.
*  So what happens in the Exodus story, because it also details out how this should be structured,
*  is that Moses has a vision of individual responsibility and social organization that's
*  maximally responsibility based.
*  So Moses tells the Pharaoh to let his people go, but that's not the phrase.
*  The phrase is God tells Moses to say this.
*  He says, let my people go so they may worship me in the desert.
*  And so you move out of the tyranny.
*  That's what happens, let's say, in the throes of a psychedelic experience is that the preconceptions
*  are shattered.
*  Now you're somewhere unstructured.
*  Okay, well, you can't worship what's unstructured.
*  You have to find the proper structuring for your new freedom.
*  The vision that's put forward in the book of Exodus is a vision of multi-dimensional
*  responsible identity.
*  So you take on responsibility for your own life.
*  You take on responsibility for the life of your wife or your husband.
*  You take on responsibility for your family.
*  You're a model for your community.
*  You serve your state.
*  You do what you can for your nation, and that's all united under your highest upward orientation.
*  And that's ordered freedom.
*  That's ordered freedom.
*  It's not the same as the hedonistic freedom that the people like Nixon and the sort of
*  right-wing conservatives of the 1960s were terrified by, that kind of hedonistic anarchy.
*  It's not freedom.
*  It erupted out of nowhere.
*  I mean, we're right now in 2024.
*  I want you to imagine 2014.
*  It's the same.
*  It's the same.
*  There's nothing different other than the threat of AI and war and socially.
*  The world's the same.
*  You go from 1956 to 1966.
*  You have a completely different world, a completely different world.
*  Everyone's going crazy.
*  The opposition to the Vietnam War has got people in the streets.
*  Ken Kesey, Tim Leary, tune in, drop out, all that.
*  This world is changing in this radical way.
*  There had been nothing like it.
*  And in a lot of what you're saying about these experiences happening and people just disconnecting
*  and not having discipline and structure and just experiencing these things and just disconnecting
*  completely from society was the problem.
*  That was the problem.
*  It's a major problem.
*  Well, it's still a problem now to some degree because people who are pursuing, let's say,
*  non-conformist freedom don't understand that the replacement for freedom isn't hedonistic
*  anarchy.
*  And that's partly because it's self-defeating.
*  It's also pointless.
*  It's also pointless and meaningless.
*  It's partly pointless and meaningless because imagine, and this is part of the implication
*  of the story of Abraham, is that the instinct of meaning comes to you when you pursue a
*  pathway that specifies, what would you say, the limitless development of your integrated
*  psyche.
*  But it's not just the psyche.
*  It's the integration of the psyche with all the different levels of society.
*  For example, insofar as you're well put together, you're going to be a highly functional husband
*  to your wife.
*  Right?
*  Like, your own psychological organization, integration, cannot be divorced from the union
*  that you make with your wife.
*  They're the same thing.
*  And then you can extend that to your kids.
*  For you to get your act together means simultaneously that you establish the proper relationship
*  with your wife and with your children.
*  Those are the same thing.
*  And then if you can manage that, you do the same thing with the broader community.
*  It all stacks up musically.
*  And so then mental health doesn't become how your psyche is organized internally, which
*  is what the clinical psychologists misled people into believing.
*  It's more like the harmony that obtains from the psyche upward through society when everything
*  is stacked up properly to the highest level possible of being.
*  And that's another definition of God.
*  So one of the things I tried to do in this book is to actually define what it is that
*  we're arguing about.
*  Because the old man in the sky superstition doesn't cover the territory.
*  So for example, if you look at God in the story of Abraham and you say, do you believe
*  in that God?
*  What you're asking, even though you might not know it is, do you believe that there
*  is a call to adventure?
*  And that following that call will not only integrate you, but serve society in the highest
*  possible manner.
*  And that's a pretty straightforward question.
*  It has very little to do with anything that's even vaguely superstitious.
*  Like is that call there?
*  You certainly reward it in your children if you have the least bit of sense.
*  And so I've been trying to define what it is that we're arguing about.
*  And so there's another definition too that you see this in the story of Adam and Eve.
*  So in the story of Adam and Eve, one of the ways God is characterized is as the spirit
*  that calls you on your pride and presumption.
*  So then you ask yourself, well, do you believe that exists?
*  It's like, how often in your own life has pride gone before a fall?
*  Is there some spirit that's operative in being that shows you the error of your ways
*  when you get ahead of yourself or not?
*  And if the answer to that is no, you say, well, you have no conscience.
*  Nothing calls you on your moral impropriety, your overreaching.
*  No one wants to be near you if you're one of those people.
*  That's for sure.
*  And is that real?
*  So one of the ways God is presented in the Old Testament is this dynamic between calling
*  and conscience, right?
*  So there's the calling that is indicated in the story of Abraham and Moses that pulls
*  you forward to the adventure of your life.
*  And the other side of that is the constraint of conscience that tells you when you're wandering
*  off the straight and narrow path.
*  That's more the voice of negative emotion and threat detection.
*  The calling is more like the voice of positive emotion that pulls you forward and invites
*  you.
*  But you need the dynamic between those two.
*  That's the pillar of light and the pillar of darkness that guides the Israelites across
*  the desert.
*  Jonathan Pazio helped me figure that out.
*  Just flattened me when he laid it out because I could see the Taoist view of the world and
*  the ancient Jewish view of the world stack on top of each other.
*  And the implication of the story is very straight.
*  It's like you leave a tyranny and you're lost.
*  What guides you when you're lost?
*  The interaction between what calls you forward and upward and the constraints of your own
*  conscience that warn you when you're deviating from the straight and narrow path.
*  That's the definition of God that emerges from Exodus.
*  And the balance of the mind to be able to figure out which is which and how to apply
*  them.
*  And the balance of the mind, this is why you have to have the least amount of problems
*  in your life and keep your body as healthy as possible.
*  So you don't have all these other things that are influencing the way you interact with
*  the world.
*  You got to have a balance of everything.
*  All of it has to be kind of balanced together in order for you to have the judgment.
*  Yes.
*  Otherwise you can't see.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to be able to see it.
*  And it's hard.
*  And you have to want to see it.
*  Yes.
*  So why do you want to see it?
*  Me?
*  Yeah.
*  It's just my instinct.
*  I have instincts with everything.
*  I always have.
*  Why?
*  I don't know.
*  I think because I didn't have a lot of guidance when I was young.
*  And because I was a latchkey kid and parents divorced, split apart, a lot of moving.
*  I think I developed my own appreciation of my instincts, of my thought.
*  And I had seen enough people by the time I was a young boy ruin their lives and make
*  poor decisions.
*  And I'd seen these poor decisions right in front of me.
*  I'd seen poor thinking and excuse making and laziness.
*  Right.
*  So you could see the negative consequences.
*  Yes.
*  I'd seen all these things.
*  And because I didn't feel protected, I genuinely felt like I was on my own and I had to figure
*  things out on my own.
*  I developed a very early trust and recognition of the importance of that.
*  And it's led me through my entire life.
*  Everything that I ever did that was like a big risk was like a calling to me.
*  Every single thing that I ever did, from getting into martial arts, I went from not doing it
*  to doing it every day, all day, seven days a week.
*  It was a calling.
*  It was like my mind interfaced with whatever that was, martial arts was, and said, this
*  is my ticket out of here.
*  This is my ticket to be a different person.
*  Was that discipline?
*  What was the ticket, do you think?
*  I don't even know if you call it discipline back then because it was more of an obsession.
*  So when you're obsessed with something, it doesn't require discipline because you can't
*  wait to do it again.
*  Discipline, Mike Tyson said best.
*  It was a real calling for you.
*  Mike Tyson said best.
*  He said, discipline is doing something you hate, but doing it like you love it.
*  When you're in training camp, like Mike Tyson was for a big heavyweight fight, you're pushing
*  the limits of your physical endurance and recovery because you're trying to achieve
*  an adaptation.
*  You can't maintain fight ready fitness all year round.
*  One thing that people don't understand about like fight ready, feel like when a guy like
*  Islam Makachev, who is the UFC lightweight champion, the pound for pound best fighter
*  on earth, when that guy's fighting, when he gets into the cage on the day, whatever it
*  is that Saturday night, this is a peak of performance and training that cannot be maintained.
*  He wants to catch it right when he's right there, when the body hasn't broken down yet,
*  the immune system hasn't broken down yet, the endocrine system isn't fried, the adrenals
*  aren't fried.
*  You're getting it to right when your body can recover and is forced to maintain this
*  insane level of fitness and then you have to take a break.
*  You cannot maintain fight camp all year round.
*  You will not be able to do it.
*  Your body will break down.
*  My point is that requires discipline because you're no longer in the inspiration realm.
*  In the obsession realm you are, I'm sure, as well, but you're also in there's no fucking
*  way you want to do it.
*  There's no way you want to do more sprints.
*  There's no way you want to do all this stuff.
*  You must do it though.
*  You must do the calisthenics.
*  You must do the live wrestling drills.
*  You must do the shark tank where they throw in a new fresh opponent every round for five
*  rounds so you're dealing with rested killers and you're exhausted.
*  You have to do that.
*  That's pure discipline and generally enforced discipline by coaches because it's so rigid,
*  it's so hard to do that you need someone over you with a stopwatch.
*  Let's go, let's go, let's go.
*  They ask to get up and go at it because even the most disciplined, their body recognizes
*  they need a break.
*  That's pure discipline.
*  What I had was this obsession that made that hard work easy.
*  That's a key thing.
*  Now imagine that underneath that there's an implicit or unconscious goal.
*  I'm saying this for a very specific reason.
*  The positive emotion that motivates people is always experienced in relationship to a
*  goal.
*  Now this is a very important thing for everyone to understand because it means that if you
*  don't have a goal, you have no positive emotion.
*  It also means that the higher your goal, the more positive emotion you experience when
*  you're moving towards it because positive emotion signifies progress towards a goal.
*  You need a goal.
*  of the deepest religious traditions is the ultimate goal by definition.
*  So the idea is that you need a goal and so you should pick the utmost possible goal.
*  That's another good definition of something like the kingdom of heaven or the realm of
*  the divine, the ultimate goal.
*  Now you have a goal and every time you see movement towards it, you're going to get,
*  You're riding on the energy that's associated with movement towards that goal.
*  That's dopaminergically mediated.
*  That's the same systems that are affected by cocaine and methamphetamine and so forth.
*  All the positive emotion drugs.
*  So you need a goal.
*  That goal, now you can imagine this, that if you're attentive to the action of your
*  own instincts or the divine voice, I don't think those are distinguishable, then a goal
*  is going to emerge that catalyzes a series of transformations.
*  This is what happens to Abraham.
*  So he has a series of adventures after he decides that he's going to go out in the
*  world and every adventure is marked by the erection of a sacrificial altar and a recommitment
*  of his upward aim.
*  Now there's two reasons for that.
*  One is that he reminds himself that he's aiming upward and he's on an adventure and the second
*  is he admits to himself that with every transformation of character, something has to be sacrificed.
*  So you know, so now I'm curious about this in your own life, right?
*  So you started obsessively committing to martial arts.
*  What did you have to give up to do that?
*  Social life.
*  Okay.
*  What else?
*  That's basically it.
*  I was a kid.
*  Okay.
*  Social life.
*  I didn't really have responsibilities other than school.
*  So to leave from school and go right to training.
*  Okay.
*  So there's an emergent idea in that story of adventure led transformation that with
*  profound transformation of character, something that's not appropriate has to be let go of.
*  That's why, by the way, that's why Abraham's story culminates in the sacrifice of his son
*  because the sacrifices get higher in value as the developmental progression upward continues.
*  And that's basically the story of individual development, right?
*  Follow the call of adventure.
*  Aim upward.
*  Really remind yourself of your fundamental goal and then let go of everything that isn't
*  appropriate as you transform forward.
*  So Abraham ends up with a new name because of doing that.
*  That's how different he becomes in the course of his adventure.
*  It's like Jacob.
*  Jacob becomes Israel and Abraham becomes Abraham because the consequence of him following the
*  pathway of adventure, the calling, is a transformation that's so complete it's as if he's a different
*  person.
*  And now those stories are maps of that transformative process.
*  So they culminate in the Christian view of things with the ultimate sacrificial offering.
*  So that's the idea that lurks in the New Testament is that the ultimate in transformation is
*  brought about by your willingness to put absolutely everything on the line no matter what.
*  Right?
*  And that's a very different view of the religious enterprise than something like defense against
*  death anxiety.
*  Right?
*  And that's the ultimate adventure and that's the willingness to welcome everything about
*  life that's terrible and painful and malevolent.
*  To welcome that with open arms.
*  To accept that.
*  And that's predicated on a deeper idea even which is that sacrifice is the basis of community.
*  Which is exactly right.
*  Because you have to give up something to be in relationship to the future and to other
*  people.
*  Right.
*  The biblical corpus is an examination of what would you say levels of sacrifice moving downward
*  to the ultimate possible level of sacrifice.
*  So in the Abrahamic story Abraham is requested by God to offer up his son.
*  Right now he does it.
*  He gets him back.
*  The threat isn't carried through.
*  And what does that mean?
*  It means first of all that everything in your life no matter what it is including your relationships
*  should be made subservient to the highest possible aim.
*  It also means that a good father sacrifices his children to what's highest.
*  That's the offering of your child to the world.
*  The faithful offering of your child to the world.
*  That's what Mary does.
*  There's a famous statue of Mary in St. Peter's in Rome.
*  Michelangelo made it when he was like 23 some ridiculous early age brilliant statue.
*  Mary is holding the body of her son broken in her arms looking serene.
*  He's an adult off the cross.
*  It's like the female crucifixion.
*  And the idea is that the good mother, the proper father offers their children to be
*  broken by the world in the pursuit of what's highest.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah yeah.
*  He was 23 when he made that?
*  That is insane.
*  What were you doing when you were 23?
*  Telling shitty jokes.
*  Single block of marble.
*  Isn't that insane?
*  Yeah and so see that's an indication of sacred femininity because see the psychoanalyst
*  said in the early part of the 20th century that the good mother necessarily fails.
*  And so what does that mean?
*  Well every woman who brings a child into the world knows that the child is going to be
*  broken by death and malevolence.
*  Right and so motherhood in the highest in its highest aspect is the offering of the
*  child to the world to be broken.
*  That's what's portrayed in the Abrahamic story too with regards to Abraham.
*  To get your child back you offer them to the world.
*  That's a profound indication of faith right that life is worthwhile despite its suffering
*  and its evil.
*  And it's so good.
*  The work, like look at his foot.
*  Just look at the detail on the way the toe bends, the heel.
*  It's insane how good it is.
*  He was so good.
*  The fact that he figured out how to be that good at 23 years of age is just so shocking.
*  Well also so inspiring.
*  So inspiring but stunning.
*  Like stunning how good it is.
*  Yes and stunning what it means and where it's placed.
*  And the understanding of anatomy.
*  Did he really?
*  Wow insane.
*  I mean that guy left behind so much.
*  Like what is that about?
*  What is it about these unique individuals like him that their work transcends time?
*  That's life eternal.
*  That ability to transcend time.
*  Yeah.
*  Thousands of years later people will look at those.
*  So what happens in the Abrahamic story because it's relevant to your question.
*  So God offers Abraham the opportunity to be the father of nations.
*  Okay so imagine this as a father.
*  So we use father as a generic word.
*  Everybody has a father so there's a generic aspect to it.
*  There's a role that you play if you're a father.
*  And then you could imagine there's a role you could play as a good father.
*  And if you're a good father you're radically encouraging.
*  And you encourage your children to go out into the world and prevail.
*  You teach them to handle serpents.
*  You don't protect them.
*  You don't shelter them.
*  You push them out and you say no matter what comes your way kid I've got confidence that
*  you can handle it.
*  No matter how terrible it is.
*  No matter how challenging or daunting or malevolent it is you've got it.
*  And when you see your children doing that if you're a good father it fills you with
*  what?
*  It fills you with gratitude and love to see your children acting that out even at an early
*  age to take taking the risks of their first steps or climbing their first play structure
*  or going out in the playground to make new friends when they're strangers or going off
*  to school alone.
*  All of that you think.
*  It's dangerous out there.
*  It's like good go.
*  I know you can handle it.
*  Okay so that's what Abraham plays out.
*  He plays out that archetypal role.
*  And the idea there this is why I made reference earlier to the idea of the selfish gene.
*  Dawkins characterized human reproduction as selfish.
*  That's wrong because the human reproductive pattern is multigenerational.
*  And if you want to establish the pattern of fatherhood that's going to cascade down the
*  generations that will make your descendants successful in the multigenerational manner
*  then you follow the spirit adventure and you imbue your children with that confidence.
*  And that's how that pattern that establishes the dynasty so Abraham is the father of nations
*  is established.
*  So human reproduction is way more complex than just sex.
*  Far more complex.
*  It's a multigenerational commitment.
*  So now the promise that God makes to Abraham in part is that if you fall into that pattern
*  of maximal adventure and courageous movement forward that your life is imbued with a meaning
*  that transcends time and that you embody something like an archetypal and eternal spirit.
*  And that's the spirit of the father.
*  That's why Abraham understands that he's made contact with the God of his ancestors.
*  And if you're a good father you have that spirit dwelling within you.
*  And the Christian insistence is that that spirit is identical to the logos that bears
*  the weight of the world on its shoulders voluntarily.
*  And that that's what brings everything into being.
*  Stunning.
*  It's a stunning conceptualization.
*  And I think it's right.
*  It looks right to me.
*  And the idea that sacrifice is the basis of the community, that's just obvious.
*  Like the fact that you're married.
*  So what's the sacrificial gesture there?
*  Well, all other women.
*  That's sacrifice number one.
*  Then it's not about you.
*  It's also not about your wife.
*  It's about the stability of your union across time.
*  And it's about the stability of that union insofar as that's a reliable foundation for
*  your children.
*  So that's sacrificial too.
*  You give up your whims in the present so that the future is stabilized.
*  You give up your immaturity so that your children can thrive.
*  That's all sacrificial gesture.
*  And we figured that out.
*  That's why we put the crucifix at the center of our society.
*  Because we figured out, even though we didn't know it, we figured out that the stability
*  of the community is predicated on the willingness of the individual to sacrifice.
*  And the exploration in the New Testament is the limits of sacrifice.
*  Right?
*  So do you think that that's what people think of when they think of the cross?
*  It's very hard to think about.
*  It's very hard to know what people think about.
*  I would say it depends on their level of sophistication.
*  Right.
*  That's what I'm getting at.
*  I don't think it's ever been explained to me that way.
*  And I don't think most people think about it that way.
*  When they think about it, they think Jesus died for our sins.
*  There he is.
*  Praise Jesus.
*  Right, right, right.
*  It's a very formulaic, surface level understanding of what it is we're talking about.
*  It's partly, and there's a merciful element of it, and this is what Jung was referring
*  to when he said that religion helps protect people against religious experience.
*  The full revelation of the significance, let's say, of the imitation of Christ, which is
*  supposed to be the foundation of Christian belief, is in fact the demand that you walk
*  the same pathway.
*  And that's a terrible, it's the most terrifying demand because, so Jung described the Christian
*  passion as an archetypal tragedy.
*  Now there was a reason for that.
*  So think about it this way.
*  Think about it technically.
*  So imagine that a hundred great storytellers told the most painful possible story.
*  And then imagine that you aggregated all those stories and you distilled them into one story
*  where all the terrible elements were present.
*  Okay, so now you have a representation, you have a representation of the worst life can
*  throw at you.
*  Okay, so let's take that apart a bit.
*  So the first thing that makes a tragedy tragic is that the tragedy befalls a good person.
*  Because if a tragedy befalls a villain, it's just justice.
*  It's not a tragedy.
*  So it has to be a good person.
*  So then to amplify that, you would not only have the tragedy befall a good person, you'd
*  have it befall a good person that everyone knew was good, but was not only good, was
*  the best, and that was persecuted because he was good.
*  That sort of limits it out in that direction.
*  Then you might say, well, what does he have to face?
*  Well, and the answer would be, well, the worst life has to offer.
*  Okay, early death, early painful death, early painful, humiliating, unjust death at the
*  hands of his friends, at the hands of the mob, under the thumb of a tyrant.
*  Right.
*  Brought about by people who knew that he was not only good, but the best of men.
*  That's an archetypal tragedy.
*  And then it doesn't limit out.
*  So then you have the death that occurs in consequence of that and its voluntary acceptance.
*  But that's not where it ends because the mythology surrounding the crucifixion story
*  insists that Christ harrowed hell after the crucifixion, which meant that he confronted
*  not only death, but malevolence itself, and in consequence, transcended both.
*  And so what's the underlying psychological message?
*  It's something like the calling and the voice of conscience informing people that in order
*  to thrive properly in life and to become who you could be, if you could be everything you
*  could be, you have to voluntarily take on the weight of the worst life has to offer,
*  including the depths of malevolence itself.
*  And you think, well, obviously, Joe, you know this.
*  How are you going to adapt to a situation you won't even admit to?
*  Right.
*  Well, so how could it be otherwise than for you to become everything that you could be?
*  You have to embrace all of the catastrophes that life has to offer.
*  How could it be other than that?
*  You're going to hide?
*  You're going to pretend?
*  Right.
*  How is that going to work?
*  No one thinks that'll work.
*  And you're right.
*  There is this defensive element to the, particularly the Protestant religious tradition, although
*  I don't want to single out the Protestants specifically, that insists that, you know,
*  the work has already been done.
*  But there's a lot of ambivalence about that in the Christian canon because there's an
*  equal insistence that, no, you're supposed to take all this on voluntarily.
*  And that not only that, not only that, that that's such an interesting idea because it
*  makes so much sense psychologically.
*  So imagine that as your courage grows so that you can confront more and more of the horror
*  of life, that a spirit begins to develop within you that gives you a strength that's commensurate
*  with your daring, that's walking with God.
*  That's the same thing.
*  So the promise is that if you had the courage, something would be with you to allow you to
*  bear up nobly under the burden.
*  And all the clinical evidence supports that proclamation because what you see in people,
*  in the therapeutic transformation, is that insofar as they're willing to confront what
*  terrifies them voluntarily, they get stronger.
*  And then imagine that there's no, there's nothing but a metaphysical limit to that.
*  And I think that's right.
*  I can't see how it cannot be right.
*  It makes sense.
*  It resonates with how we know people that have overcome great things in their life and
*  become these very unusual and unique people.
*  I got to pause because I have to use the restroom.
*  But let's jump right back into it.
*  Where were we?
*  Well, we were kind of bringing We Who Resa With God to a close, I would say.
*  I've got other projects I want to talk to you about.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Sure.
*  We're launching Peterson Academy today.
*  So Online University, we hope.
*  We'll see.
*  We've got, we're launching with 20 courses.
*  Best lectures in the world.
*  Very very high quality production.
*  We invited the best lecturers I could find down to Miami.
*  Eight hour courses on the topic they really want.
*  Highest possible production quality.
*  And we're hoping we'll make a high level university level, university equivalent education available
*  to everyone for approximately one twentieth the cost.
*  So that's the plan.
*  You want to see the opening, the opening, Salvo?
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Put it up.
*  Put it up, Jamie.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's take a look.
*  I ran this before my lectures this last tour.
*  You got to put the headphones on if you want.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So Online University.
*  Well.
*  There is a crisis now in higher education.
*  The president of Harvard University resigned today.
*  He's calling for the genocide of Jews violate.
*  Pen so code of conduct.
*  We have a problem of affordability and cost spiraling student loans.
*  We have a group think emerging and that warps the entire academic enterprise.
*  I experimented with putting my lectures online and found that I could teach far more people
*  at very low cost than I could at the university.
*  And I thought, well, why not scale that?
*  What I'm hoping to do is to find the best lectures in the world and to bring them to
*  as wide as possible an audience.
*  He came to me and he basically said, I want you to do the best course that you've always
*  wanted to do.
*  We want to bring you the highest quality education possible at the lowest possible price.
*  It's extremely high level content that anybody can use to educate themselves and it's available
*  to everybody.
*  Well, that would be good.
*  I think it's funny because I got cancelled at the university so I could try to return
*  the favor.
*  I think they're doing that to themselves, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, we couldn't have a better marketing campaign than the universities themselves.
*  It's similar to what's going on with mainstream media.
*  Yeah.
*  It really is kind of the same thing.
*  Yeah, well, it all derives from the same source, right?
*  Is the capture of higher education by this God forsaken ideology that's...
*  Bizarre.
*  Yeah.
*  Bizarre how successful it is and how many people just are compliant.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very strange.
*  That's for sure.
*  That's for sure.
*  Yeah, well...
*  Do you see it turning around though?
*  It seems like it is a little.
*  It seems like more people are pushing back against it now than ever.
*  When you have institutions that are thoroughly captured, it's very difficult to retrieve
*  them.
*  You know, we've been arguing about this.
*  I've been arguing about this with my team, Fort Peterson Academy.
*  Is it possible to rejuvenate the bricks and mortars institutions of higher education?
*  Well, one answer to that is things that are dead rot and the universities seem to be rotting
*  everywhere.
*  Maybe that's because they're dead.
*  Maybe it's because their time has come.
*  It could be that that's the case.
*  I hope not.
*  I loved working at Harvard in particular.
*  It was an amazing institution.
*  I had a very good time at McGill.
*  I had a good time at the University of Toronto.
*  It's a real pain to see these institutions degenerate.
*  But they're ideologically captured.
*  That's not good and thoroughly.
*  And it's a very rotten ideology.
*  It's the spirit of Kane, the resentful spirit of Kane.
*  It's not good.
*  They're unbelievably expensive.
*  They take terrible advantage of their students.
*  Plus the average quality of the educational experience is actually very low at most places,
*  not everywhere.
*  Hillsdale College, I think, is a marked exception.
*  But most places, the lectures aren't good.
*  We're in a situation now, it's kind of like what happened with YouTube in a way.
*  You know, YouTube enabled you, for example, and Spotify as well, to emerge as an independent
*  commentator.
*  And you know, you've cornered the market in some ways on that.
*  There's no reason.
*  The universities could have seen this coming 20 years ago.
*  They could have found their best lectures and they could have filmed their courses in
*  the highest possible quality manner and taken advantage of this new communication technology.
*  And they didn't.
*  And that's not a good sign.
*  You know, it's so funny, we bring our professors down to Miami, you know, professors from Oxford
*  and Cambridge, and they're so relieved to come there.
*  And the reason they're relieved to come there is because they're treated badly by their
*  own institutions, these great professors.
*  They're treated with contempt.
*  They're paid miserably.
*  That's especially the case in the UK.
*  All we have to do is appreciate them.
*  I tell the professors who come to Peterson Academy, like, here's the deal.
*  You can say exactly what you want in exactly the way you want.
*  You can teach what you love.
*  We'll put a studio audience together that actually wants to listen to you.
*  That's the only reason they're there.
*  We'll offer you a financial deal that's better than you can get with any book.
*  We'll give you more reach than you could ever also hope to get with any published manuscript.
*  You can bring what you know to the world for next to nothing.
*  We figure we can offer a university quality, high-level university quality equivalent for
*  about $2,000 over four years.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, yeah, we have a great social media platform.
*  So I don't know, you tell me what you think about this.
*  So we've been wrestling with price, right?
*  Because pricing something is very difficult.
*  And part of the problem with social media platforms is that they're free.
*  And you might say, well, that's not a problem.
*  It is a problem because things that are free get overrun by parasites instantly.
*  And so you get the trolls, you get the bots, you get the bad corporate actors, you get
*  the scam artists, because there's no barrier to their participation.
*  And so we put a $450 cost on our offering per year for the early adopters that's available
*  now.
*  We're hoping that the fact that there has to be a bit of a financial sacrifice in the
*  front end will make our social media network high quality and clean, because there's a
*  little bit of skin in the game to participate.
*  So we've taken the best elements of the popular social media networks and amalgamated that.
*  And we're hoping that we can produce a community of people who are responsible and achievement-oriented
*  and upwards-driving and intellectually curious and bring them together so they can form their
*  own communities as well as participating in the lectures.
*  And so I'm extremely excited about this.
*  The courses, we got lucky too, because we set up a production studio in Miami, and we
*  have state-of-the-art film crew and editors.
*  But just when we started to film, the AI illustration capacity came online, and we filmed everyone
*  against a white background.
*  And so we can fill the whole background with imagery and graphs and comments.
*  Can you run a trailer for, just pick one of the courses at random, because this is actually
*  how the courses look.
*  So the trailers are very tightly edited, but so are the courses.
*  And so let me show you one of them so you get a sense of what we've managed to accomplish.
*  A lot of fascinating questions.
*  Where did we come from?
*  Where are we going?
*  What is the universe made of?
*  How can we possibly understand the grand landscape of the cosmos?
*  When you look back in space, you look back in time.
*  It's amazing we've been able to do this, to study the properties of the cosmos, the
*  time scales of billions of years, size scales billions of times bigger than our own.
*  And now the question is, can we go back to time equals zero?
*  Can we go back to before time equals zero?
*  And what does that even mean?
*  I hope in this course to keep striving and asking these great questions, because without
*  great questions, there can be no great answers.
*  And without great answers, there can be no understanding.
*  Wow.
*  Brian Keating.
*  Fanjio.
*  Pretty badass.
*  Yeah, well, and I was so happy when I saw the trailers, you know, because Michaela and
*  her husband Jordan Fuller, they've been working very diligently on this for about three years,
*  and they basically built it from scratch, you know, and I didn't have any idea how the
*  courses would look, you know, because that's actually a pretty difficult thing to pull
*  off.
*  But I'm very happy with the trailers.
*  They're extremely engaging.
*  Every course has its own style sheet, like, so each course has its, there's an overarching
*  style to the platform.
*  But every single course has its own illustration, ethos and quality.
*  Yeah, well, you can see them.
*  Now, would you be, is this just for personal education?
*  Or will you be giving degrees?
*  We're going to, we're going to, we're going to approach that in two ways.
*  So we'll offer certification at different time spans.
*  So you know, generally it takes you four years to get a degree, but you can imagine that
*  it would be useful to have a one year certificate, two year certificate, three year certificate,
*  four year certificate.
*  Like there's no compelling reason why it has to be four years.
*  They'll keep very detailed records of our students' academic progress and they'll
*  be able to offer them directly to employers.
*  So we want to be able to assure employers that anybody who's gone through the certification
*  process that's part and parcel of Peterson Academy has done the work and met the standards
*  and the standards will be high.
*  Now simultaneously, we're working on technical accreditation, right, so that we can pull
*  this, so that we can have this operate as a standard university.
*  Now there's trade-offs in that because the accreditation processes themselves are captured
*  by the same forces that have captured the universities and we're not going to compromise
*  the quality of the offerings by kowtowing to accreditation processes that are producing
*  the same problem that we're trying to address.
*  Now I'm in discussion with a number of different jurisdictions to move accreditation forward
*  and if that happens, it can also be applied retroactively.
*  So if we can figure out how to do it with an administration or a jurisdiction that's
*  willing to do it and we don't have to compromise the quality, then we'll go the classic accreditation
*  route.
*  Otherwise, I'm just going to go directly to employers and say, look, we're going to be
*  very, very careful about who we grant certification to and you'll be able to rely on the certification
*  from Peterson Academy as an indication of intellectual ability and also work ethic and
*  we'll document that by the record keeping process that we use as part and parcel of
*  the platform.
*  So I think we can do it.
*  We're going to do it one way or another.
*  How are you going to be able to assure that these students, because it's all remote, right?
*  How are you going to be able to assure that they're actually doing the work, that they're
*  not utilizing AI?
*  Like, are you going to have them write things?
*  I can't tell you how, but we are going to.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah, well, look, I've tested tens of thousands of people online.
*  So I set up an online testing service that was used primarily by a company called the
*  Founder Institute and we tested 50,000 people, 60,000 people over five years in about seven
*  different languages and we built and developed technology to capture people who are cheating.
*  So they don't know how we're capturing them and I'm not going to tell you, but we know
*  how to do it.
*  Of course.
*  And that's obviously a problem, but it isn't an insoluble problem and I think we've already
*  solved it.
*  So and then once we move towards more formal and stable accreditation, there are lots of
*  companies have emerged as a consequence of the COVID lockdowns to make sure that remote
*  compliance with testing requirements can be achieved.
*  So there's lots of ways to solve that problem.
*  So it's very exciting.
*  It's really exciting and it's, you know, there's all sorts of weird possibilities that emerge
*  from this too, because the technology now exists and we've had some of the videos converted
*  already to have the lectures translated into the world's major languages and the technology
*  that's cutting edge uses the professor's voice and intonation in the second language and
*  matches the mouth movements to the language.
*  Yeah, they're going to do that at Spotify.
*  Yeah, it's seamless, man.
*  It's seamless.
*  They're doing it with podcasts.
*  I think they're they're initially going to do Spanish, German and French.
*  I believe those are the first three languages, but they eventually will scale out.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's just like that.
*  It's unbelievable.
*  Have someone teach a lecture in Russian and actually make the mouth movements and everything.
*  Well, it's extremely exciting, especially in regard to the developing world, because
*  there's a, you know, there'll be more people in Nigeria by 2100 than in China.
*  And the median age of African is 19.
*  So there's an immense opportunity in the developing world to capture the market for higher education.
*  And it would be a wonderful thing to be able to bring this to the world.
*  And I just can't see why not.
*  You know, the courses are very efficiently taught.
*  We have AI mediated testing services and we can use the tests themselves as educational
*  tools.
*  You know, so you can imagine you have a test, you get a question wrong and you get feedback
*  that it's wrong and it'll tell you where in the lecture and the reading material that
*  you made the mistake.
*  So you can go back and review.
*  And so even the testing itself will be educational.
*  And you know, we're hoping to develop a community that is composed of people who want to engage
*  in lifelong learning.
*  And it also means that you don't have to be like 18 to 22 to attend this university.
*  You can stay a part of it for the rest of your life.
*  And we're hoping that spontaneous communities will develop and that we can bring people
*  together for conventions.
*  So you know, if we can get enough people on the platform, we'll have conventions in different
*  cities where we bring our lecturers, you know, to a stadium or to a theatre for a weekend
*  and everybody who's part of the university can come and listen to their favorite lecturers.
*  And we've got educational institutions who are already interested in partnering in that
*  regard so that they can be brought to their institution for like summertime three-day
*  courses.
*  And so, and it's so fun too, because we can use video and audio and that's a wonderful
*  thing as well, because as you know well, far more people can listen and watch than can
*  read.
*  to partake in our courses as well, but it's a great opportunity.
*  And it's so fun to have the professors come down there and be thrilled about it.
*  Most of like we want the professors we already have to teach multiple courses because they're
*  very good lecturers and they've, they've, I think all without exception, enthusiastically
*  agreed to continue participating because we took the idiot restrictions off them.
*  It's like teach what you want to the people who want to listen.
*  No holds barred.
*  It's so fun.
*  It's so fun.
*  With the state of higher education the way it is today, how does it recover or does it
*  just get replaced?
*  Well, I guess what I'm hoping at least that the Peterson Academy will do with the production
*  quality of our courses is up the ante.
*  It's like even if we fail financially, because you know, we don't know how to price this,
*  how the hell do you figure out something like that?
*  We've argued about it a lot and we don't know what the potential financial market might
*  be, but at minimum, you know, we'll be able to launch the courses independently if the
*  platform itself doesn't take off.
*  We're going to show Harvard and Stanford and Oxford and Cambridge what's possible with
*  regards to lecturing with the new technology.
*  I mean, they're stuck in like 1860.
*  And you know, with these, these like online large courses that places like MIT, for example,
*  have launched, basically all they do is put up a camera and videotape a lecture.
*  It's like you can't do that.
*  That's the YouTube and the technologies that allow for the dissemination of video.
*  They have their own, they're their own medium, right?
*  The medium is the message.
*  You have to use the bloody technology.
*  You can't stay stuck a century back, which is why we've done tight edits and filled
*  in the backgrounds with images.
*  There's just no reason that that can't be everywhere.
*  Right.
*  So and why, why would you pay?
*  Look, people probably pay $300,000 for an Ivy League education because that's where
*  they meet their wife or their husband when it gets right down to it.
*  Is that really what it is?
*  Well, Joe, look, you never know what an institution is doing.
*  Okay, so what does the university do?
*  Lectures, accreditation.
*  Okay, but that's not all.
*  It gives you an identity for four years while you sort your life out.
*  It gives you an opportunity to mature away from your parents.
*  It gives you the opportunity to build a new network of peers, not only living peers, but
*  peers in the historical tradition.
*  And it gives you an opportunity to meet the person that you might be with for the rest
*  of your life.
*  That's a big deal.
*  And it's a selective opportunity because you bring bright kids together who are hard
*  working and they get a chance to meet each other.
*  That might be the whole value of an Ivy League education.
*  It's hard to specify these things.
*  Now we're trying to replicate that on Peterson Academy with the social media side.
*  And you know, that's a new technology and we don't know how it'll work.
*  But the fact that it's selective and it won't be full of trolls and bots and bad corporate
*  actors should mean that people will be able to build social networks that are of high
*  value because that's one of the things, obviously, that's what you do in a bloody MBA program.
*  You know, it's not what you learn at an MBA program that confers the value of the degree.
*  That's the fact that it was bloody difficult to get in because the GMAT is an IQ test essentially
*  and the social network you build in the MBA program.
*  You carry that with you while we're doing what we can to replicate that online.
*  And we're going to make sure that we offer potential employees a record of our students'
*  progress and success so that they have some sense that the person who they hire has done
*  the apprenticeship work on their own necessary to accredit them as a, say, a valid student
*  and a hard worker.
*  And I think we can do that.
*  And I think we can do it more effectively than universities do it.
*  I know how to measure these things.
*  It's going to be very interesting if that becomes a criteria in which people are hired.
*  You know, if someone, if it really does become a thing and it becomes something where people
*  are accepting that as an education and seeking people out in that regard, it's going to be
*  very interesting to see if more of those emerge.
*  If you start a trend and then...
*  Well, at minimum we can assure a potential employer of two things.
*  We didn't attract a woke crowd.
*  And we didn't indoctrinate our bloody students.
*  So that's not a bad minimum.
*  You know, you can assure intelligence.
*  You can assure a work ethic because they've completed the course material and properly.
*  We can ensure that's properly measured.
*  But we can also say, here's a bunch of things they didn't learn.
*  Right.
*  The courses are subversive in the most traditional possible way.
*  So we have Larry Arn, for example, who's the president of Hillsdale.
*  He did a lecture series on Churchill.
*  Where are you going to go to university to get a lecture series on Churchill?
*  And Arn was Churchill's primary biographer, one of his primary biographers.
*  So that's a big deal.
*  You know, we've got Nigel Bigger from Oxbridge lecturing on the legacy of UK colonialism.
*  Well, you're not going to get that anywhere else.
*  And he's a great lecturer.
*  And he's a brilliant man and very, very courageous.
*  And Larry Arn is in exactly the same category.
*  So the technology we're using is revolutionary in a variety of different ways.
*  The lectures are high quality.
*  But the whole ethos of the educational offering is completely different than what is on offer,
*  say at the typical Ivy League.
*  Right.
*  Harvard, for example, which is such a catastrophe.
*  Like I was there at Harvard in the 1990s.
*  I loved that place.
*  It was really forward looking and aimed at excellence with very minor exceptions, like
*  truly minor exceptions.
*  It was a powerhouse, man.
*  And I went back and saw a bunch of my old professor friends a month ago.
*  And they've all joined free speech movement at Harvard and they're fighting against their
*  own administration.
*  And these were like the best professors I ever met in my life.
*  And that's what they've been reduced to.
*  When did it start?
*  Specifically in the universities?
*  Yes.
*  It started with the incursion of, what would you say, modified Marxism in the 1960s and
*  then really accelerated in the 70s.
*  It sort of went like this.
*  You know how things fail, gradually, gradually, gradually, then suddenly.
*  And it hit critical mass in terms of failure probably around 2014, 15, pretty much when
*  things blew up around me.
*  That's why they blew up around me.
*  You know, I mean, it was so ridiculous.
*  And what do you think ultimately caused it to not course correct?
*  What do you think ultimately caused these universities to give into that?
*  Okay, let's talk about ultimate.
*  So let me tell you a story, an old story.
*  So there's a myth from Mesopotamia called the Enuma Elish, which is one of the oldest
*  stories that we have.
*  And let me just lay out the story because these ancient myths capture the fundamental
*  dynamics of culture.
*  They're winnowed to do that.
*  Okay, so the Mesopotamians believe that the world emerged as the interaction of two forces.
*  We already alluded to them.
*  They had a god of order, Apsu.
*  He was a male god.
*  He's the patriarchal, patriarchy.
*  You can think of Apsu as the patriarchy.
*  And a female god, Tiamat.
*  Tiamat is a dragon and a dragon of chaos.
*  And the word Tiamat is the same word etymologically as the word Tohu Vabohu.
*  And that's the chaos that God makes the world out of at the beginning of time in the Hebrew
*  accounts.
*  Okay, so you have Apsu and Tiamat.
*  And they come together.
*  Chaos and order come together.
*  And they produce the first world.
*  And in the Mesopotamian account of things, that's a world of higher order gods.
*  Now those higher order gods forget their ancestors and go about their business.
*  And they get increasingly fractious and undisciplined and noisy and hedonistic and immature.
*  And at one point, they kill their father, Apsu.
*  And they try to live on his corpse.
*  Right.
*  So you see an echo of this.
*  It's very complicated.
*  You see an echo of this in the story of Pinocchio.
*  You know, there's a scene in Pinocchio where Geppetto ends up in the body of a whale.
*  Okay, so here's the underlying biological dynamic.
*  It's so remarkable.
*  So imagine a society sets itself up according to a set of principles.
*  And it stores, it creates a giant storehouse of wealth.
*  Okay.
*  What a carcass is.
*  Right.
*  So if you're a primordial herder, your wealth is in the bodies of your herd animals.
*  Okay.
*  A body is a symbol of stored wealth.
*  In the Mesopotamian pantheon, the careless kill their father and live on its corpse.
*  Okay.
*  That's what's happened to the universities.
*  So since World War II, the West has gathered huge storehouses of value everywhere.
*  Harvard's a great example.
*  Immense endowment.
*  Remarkably valuable brand.
*  Disney's another example.
*  And what's happened is, and this happens all the time, if you have an unguarded storehouse
*  of value, the parasites come marching in.
*  Right.
*  And they try to live on the corpse.
*  Now they can for a while because it's a storehouse of value, but they kill the spirit.
*  Now what happens in the Mesopotamian story is that chaos itself comes flooding back in
*  the form of Tiamat, who's extremely, the goddess of chaos, who's extremely angry that her husband
*  has been sacrificed by the careless denizens of the world.
*  That's the death of God.
*  So yeah, and the savior emerges in the Mesopotamian story.
*  It's so interesting.
*  So the savior that emerges to set things right has eyes all the way around his head.
*  So he pays attention and he speaks magic words.
*  That's Marduk.
*  And so the Mesopotamian emperor was an avatar of Marduk and he's the spirit of responsibility
*  that sets the world right.
*  Okay, so what are we seeing?
*  We're seeing the invasion of storehouses of wealth by the parasites, fundamentally.
*  Has that killed them?
*  I can't think through how you would rescue an institution, a typical upper level university
*  institution.
*  What are you going to do?
*  How are you going to do that?
*  You're going to fire 80% of the people?
*  Who's going to do that?
*  No one's going to do that.
*  Now you could say, well, we'll make DEI initiatives forbidden.
*  They're kind of doing that in Florida.
*  But all you do is change the words.
*  I mean, that's what the postmodernists did with Marxism in the 1970s when it no longer
*  was fashionable to worship Stalin, after everybody realized that he was a psychopathic murderer.
*  All that happened was the French intellectuals changed the terminology and they invented
*  a form of Marxism that was even worse than Marxism, which was really quite the bloody
*  achievement.
*  Do I think they can be rejuvenated?
*  I can't see how.
*  Well when you have people like the president of Harvard that gets fired for plagiarism
*  but maintains the exact same salary and a different job.
*  As if demotion to a full Harvard professor was, well, she's not suitable to be president
*  but she can still be a fully tenured professor at Harvard.
*  Really, she can, eh?
*  With that publication record, I just interviewed Carol Swain.
*  Do you know who Carol Swain is?
*  Black law professor from whom Gay plagiarized much of her work.
*  Yeah, fun.
*  So what do you do with an institution that's that far gone?
*  You saw what those university professors did at Congress and they thought they were right.
*  They didn't even look put upon.
*  They looked put upon and shocked when they were challenged by the congressman.
*  They're not accustomed to being questioned and also to communicating outside of their
*  bubble.
*  In their bubble where their opinion is held in high esteem.
*  Yes, and everyone else is an idiot as far as they're concerned.
*  The woman from Penn, when she was smiling every time she was answering these questions.
*  I'd never seen anything like that.
*  I knew that the universities had become warped.
*  The warp is very deep.
*  So I talked about the Mesopotamian story and there's another angle of deep warping.
*  So the spirit of Marx is a very old spirit.
*  It was alive in the French Revolution.
*  It was alive in the Soviet Revolution.
*  You can trace it all the way back to the story of Cain and Abel as far as I'm concerned.
*  The story of Cain and Abel is the story of the fundamental human dynamic after the fall
*  of man.
*  Insofar as we're historical creatures, the story of Cain and Abel lays out the essential
*  psychological conflict that characterizes human beings.
*  So you have Cain on the one side.
*  So Cain doesn't bring his best to the table.
*  He makes second rate offerings and lies about it.
*  Then they're not accepted by him or his fellow man or women or by society or by God.
*  Man makes him bitter.
*  And instead of learning, he takes his complaints to God and he says something like, well, what
*  the hell's going on here?
*  I'm breaking myself in half, making my sacrificial offerings and everything's being rejected.
*  What kind of stupid cosmos did you produce?
*  And God says to him something very interesting and complicated.
*  He says something like, you're blaming your bitterness on your failure, and you have failed
*  and you know it and you didn't have to, but it isn't your failure that's making you bitter.
*  You've invited something in to inhabit you that's turned you against yourself and what's
*  good.
*  He says to him, sin crouches at your door like a sexually aroused predatory animal and
*  you invited it in to have its way with you.
*  And there's a sexual metaphor there.
*  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
*  It's rough, man.
*  It's rough.
*  You don't get to be a high school shooter until you've had a thousand hours of brooding
*  over your misery.
*  And so that's what God tells Cain and that makes him violently angry and murderous.
*  And so he kills Abel.
*  He kills his own ideal.
*  And Abel, you have Cain who makes poor sacrifices and whines about it.
*  He's the perennial victim, shaking his fist at God and the world, refusing to learn from
*  his experiences.
*  And he becomes, and you have Abel who makes the right sacrifices and aims upward.
*  That's the pattern.
*  Two spirits.
*  That's the Joker and Batman.
*  That's Lex Luthor and Superman.
*  That's Voldemort and Harry Potter.
*  It's Satan and Christ.
*  Like it's this eternal recurrent pattern.
*  And one of its manifestations is Marxism and another one of its manifestations is postmodernism.
*  And so this is a very old story.
*  It's a very old story.
*  And you can understand Cain's point, you know, because people do break themselves in half
*  in life trying to struggle forward and they're not successes in their own eyes and they're
*  rejected by other people.
*  It undermines their faith in being itself.
*  You can understand that.
*  But you're called upon to bring your best to the table no matter what happens to you
*  and to maintain your faith and your courage and to aim up.
*  There's no excuses.
*  Your past trauma, there's no excuses.
*  Doesn't matter what it is.
*  And so there's this battle.
*  And what's happened in the universities is the universities have been captured by the
*  resentful spirit of Cain.
*  And so that's all flowered up with postmodern language.
*  There's no ultimate unity.
*  That's the claim of the postmodernists.
*  There's no overarching narrative.
*  It's like that's what the postmodernists claim, skepticism with regards to meta-narratives.
*  It's like, well, what do you mean by that?
*  You mean that everything culminates in disunity?
*  That's your theory of being?
*  So how the hell do we come together as a society then and around what?
*  Well everyone goes their own way.
*  Yeah, that's called war.
*  So there's some, is there a higher unity in which everything participates or not?
*  Well the postmodernists is like, no.
*  Have it your way.
*  Socialism, disunity, anxiety, hopelessness, social disintegration, conflict.
*  That's that pathway.
*  And that's just where it starts.
*  That's the optimistic view.
*  So we're trying to present at Peterson Academy and the other enterprises that I'm engaged
*  in, we're trying to present a unified underlying vision and a traditional unifying underlying
*  vision.
*  And I think that it's understandable what we talked about in the first part of this
*  interview.
*  Once you understand that sacrifice is the basis of community, and once you understand
*  that there's an ultimate form of sacrifice and that that's what's demanded of you if
*  you're going to strive upward, then the contours of the religious story that undergirds the
*  West fall into place.
*  And that's a very remarkable thing to observe.
*  And I think that's going to happen.
*  I think that's, I think we're at the end of the enlightenment and something new is striving
*  mightily to emerge.
*  Well it's also interesting that these higher education institutes, even though they do
*  have, you know, the way you're describing, they're extremely wealthy.
*  They're extremely valuable.
*  The name brand to them is still extremely potent.
*  They have so many things going against them in terms of like an objective analysis of
*  what's good for your education and what's good for preparing for your future.
*  And then on top of that, they're burdened with this insane financial problem.
*  The insane problem of first of all, student loans being something you never get out of.
*  Indentured servitude.
*  Yeah.
*  The fact that we all know that the human frontal lobe, especially on males, doesn't even fully
*  develop until you're 25.
*  So you're kind of taking advantage of a developing mind and locking them into an insane burden
*  of debt.
*  And ideology.
*  And ideology.
*  And so you're strapped with debt, so you must work, and then you must work within these
*  structures that have been infected by this ideology, because everyone's coming out of
*  the universities into those places, into those businesses and corporations, and they're
*  deeper and deeper interwoven into the structure of these businesses to the point where they're
*  inescapable.
*  And then you can't leave because you have financial burdens.
*  You have all the student loan debt to pay off.
*  Right.
*  Not good.
*  Something is an alternative to that if it can become effective to the term, like if
*  people can get employment.
*  You know, it's interesting.
*  Well, as soon as we determine the accreditation route, like I said, I'm in active communication
*  with a number of people who are interested in accreditation, but I have to figure out
*  if that's the right route.
*  If it isn't, I'm going to work directly with interested employers to make sure that what
*  our students obtain as a consequence of going through the Peterson Academy process is recognized
*  by them as a marker of a high quality applicant.
*  Yes.
*  And I know that that problem is solvable because I know how to do that.
*  Well, there's a lot of employers now that are kind of discounting the ideas of degrees.
*  Elon is a big one of them.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  Yeah, there's quite a few people that you shouldn't dismiss someone as being qualified
*  for a certain position just because they've gone through some very formal process.
*  Not if the formal process isn't predicated on general cognitive ability and conscientiousness.
*  Right.
*  But if it's predicated on bullshit and grift, which a lot of it is, what do you think is
*  going to happen with society in general with the implementation of AI and the inevitable
*  erosion of jobs?
*  I don't know if the erosion of jobs is inevitable.
*  No.
*  Well, we've thought that before.
*  Well, first of all, the first thing I would say is like, all bets are off.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  All bets are off.
*  We've built our own larger intelligent AI within five years.
*  In fact, we already have it while I'm being pessimistic.
*  Right.
*  I've used ChatGPT and GROK and some systems that my colleagues have developed for me.
*  We built our own large language models in-house.
*  So I built a, my colleague, Victor Swift, built a large language model for me trained
*  on my books.
*  And I used it to help me write this next book because I could come across biblical passages
*  that I couldn't understand and I could ask this AI system for a first pass interpretation
*  and it could do a good job.
*  And we're going to release that along with the book.
*  Yeah.
*  So that was really something.
*  And I'll tell you, ChatGPT and GROK were unbelievably useful as research assistants.
*  So they're about as smart as high end undergraduates.
*  They lie a lot and you have to corner them like mad to get them to provide you with information
*  that's valid.
*  What have you found them lying about?
*  Oh, they make up references that don't exist.
*  So for example, for ChatGPT about a quarter of the academic references it produces for
*  you don't exist.
*  What?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, it doesn't know.
*  Like, it will produce a reference for you that's completely plausible except that it
*  doesn't exist.
*  So if I ask ChatGPT a question, it'll answer and it'll give me the references because I
*  asked for the references.
*  Then I have to go and look up all the references and read them first of all, because you're
*  supposed to read the things you refer to.
*  make sure that it's not, you know, wandered off into some hallucinatory pathway.
*  But that'll be taken care of in no time flat as far as I'm concerned and Musk has already
*  got plans to do that.
*  So what will the addition of these AI systems mean to us?
*  God, well, I talked to Elon about this when we had our interview and it's going to depend
*  to some degree, Joe, on how we train the damn things.
*  So there's this problem called the alignment problem.
*  That's how the engineers describe it, which is how do we know that these AI systems will
*  have human interest in mind?
*  And you think, okay, how do we make machines that have human interests in mind?
*  And then you think, oh, well, we have the same problem with adolescents.
*  How do we ensure that we train our children so that they have their own interests and
*  broad social interests in mind?
*  And the answer is, the answer always has been that you provide them with a classic religious
*  and humanities education, because that provides an axis of stability around which all other
*  knowledge can be organized.
*  Now the problem with the large language models at the moment is they're hyper-trained on
*  modern text, and so they're ideologically addled and woke.
*  And so we've been experimenting with training LLMs on a more classic basis.
*  So we trained one on the King James Bible and we haven't released it because I don't
*  know what to think about it.
*  It's like, you can ask the King James Bible a question.
*  I was like, what the hell does that mean?
*  Right.
*  Like, seriously, what does that mean?
*  And before we release it, we also want to make sure that we have it.
*  We've developed the underlying technology properly.
*  Okay, so what's the answer to your question?
*  What AI will do will depend on the intent of the people who design it.
*  Here's a terrifying thing.
*  You tell me what you think about this.
*  All right, so your thoughts are orienting phenomena.
*  So you think so that you can lay out a pathway to a desired destination.
*  And then you can evaluate the thought to see if that's a good strategy to get there.
*  Okay, so there's an implication that comes along with that.
*  A thought enters the theater of your imagination in relationship to your goal.
*  So you can formulate that in religious language.
*  The spirit that answers your prayers, the nature of the spirit that answers your prayers
*  will be dependent on the nature of your prayer.
*  Yeah, that's for sure.
*  Right.
*  So imagine that you're harboring feelings of resentment and bitterness as you're plotting
*  your economic pathway forward.
*  And so you're trying to think about what you should do, but you have the spirit of
*  resentment and bitterness sitting on your shoulder.
*  The thoughts that enter your mind are going to be a consequence of your possession by
*  that bitterness to the degree that you've allowed it to shape your goal.
*  So here's a corollary of that.
*  This is stunning.
*  It's a stunning thing to understand.
*  If you orient your aim upward in the highest manner, the spirit that informs your thought
*  will be the spirit of the highest possible aim.
*  And God, that's something to know, man.
*  So that's what a religious practice, a fundamental religious practice is for.
*  It's like get rid of the corrupt motivation.
*  Get rid of it.
*  Get rid of it.
*  Pray for the salvation of your soul that you're aiming right because your aim is going to
*  determine the content of your thoughts.
*  And that is how it works technically.
*  That's how it works neuropsychologically.
*  Your thoughts are the handmaiden of your aim.
*  Right, which is why we're always worried about sociopaths because they never abandoned that
*  corrupt motivation.
*  Yeah, well, they're basically the best way to think about the narcissists and the hedonists
*  and the histrionic types and the borderlines and the antisocial personalities is that they
*  never matured cortically.
*  So like children come into the world in a way as a bundle of competing subcortical
*  motivations, right?
*  And they're very powerful motivations.
*  Anger, for example, you watch a two-year-old have a temper tantrum.
*  It's quite the show.
*  And they want short-term immediate gratification.
*  Now what happens is as your cortex matures, you transcend those lower order instinctual
*  motivations that would be the Freudian id and you start to regulate your behavior in
*  relationship to your own future.
*  So you stop doing stupid, pleasurable things in the moment that will compromise you and
*  you start to be able to incorporate the views of other people.
*  That's how kids at three start to develop the ability to have friends.
*  And the more sophisticated you get, the more other people and their perspectives are part
*  of your perceptions and the more the future is taken into account in your actions.
*  And the cortex is actually there so that that can happen.
*  And it has to happen in a social context because you have to pick up the society of
*  your peers, obviously.
*  And so conditions like psychopathy or even power seeking for that matter are conditions
*  of radical immaturity.
*  And so that's how you explain their emergence.
*  And one of the things that's interesting about that is it provides a very powerful argument
*  against moral relativism.
*  It's like there's a real difference between maturation and immaturity.
*  Maturation is productive and sustainable and immaturity is divisive and destructive.
*  And there's no if, ands, or buts about that.
*  And so see it's a different view of mental health because the classic therapist produced
*  view of mental health is that mental health is sort of inside you.
*  You know, it's in your psyche, it's in your mind.
*  But it's not.
*  Like your mental health is the harmony of your existence in relationship to the future
*  and other people.
*  And that sense of well-being that can infuse you if you get the balance right isn't a reflection
*  of the proper structuring of your function of your mind or your brain.
*  That's a phenomena that emerges when everything is in its proper place and operating harmoniously.
*  That's what you experience in music.
*  Like music represents that.
*  Everything in its proper place.
*  That's what Adam is called upon by God to do in the story of Adam and Eve.
*  To subdue the world.
*  Subdue everything in its proper place so that the whole structure operates in a harmonious
*  manner.
*  There's a much more expanded view of what constitutes mental health.
*  In many ways, education should serve that.
*  Right?
*  And so if you take the staff of Moses that's planted in a single place, the community grows
*  around that.
*  That's the same as the magic wand of Gandalf.
*  That idea of a magic wand.
*  It's the traditional ethos associated with transformation and sacrifice around which
*  communities aggregate themselves.
*  And a proper humanities and religious education inculcates that centre structure so that knowledge
*  can be organized around it.
*  The last time we talked I suggested to you that we see the world through a biblical lens.
*  Literally see it.
*  I mean literally.
*  It structures our perceptions.
*  And I've investigated that far more deeply.
*  And what seems to be the case with a corpus of stories like the biblical library is that
*  if you know the stories, it structures your psyche so that you have a place to put information.
*  And so that enables you to understand the current world and everything that's happening.
*  But to place everything in the right context.
*  And so the transmission of an unbroken cultural edifice, story-based edifice, is the manner
*  in which you solve the alignment problem, unite your society, integrate your psyche,
*  pursue what's meaningful, and protect yourself from chaos and anxiety.
*  So and a solid education has been the traditional way of ensuring that that occurs.
*  And so, well, that's what we hope we can offer with Peterson Academy.
*  That's the purpose of my books as well, to elucidate that.
*  So can the universities do that?
*  I don't think so.
*  I don't know if they have that philosophy.
*  The philosophy and the way you're laying it out resonates with me.
*  I think it's accurate.
*  I think when I'm in harmony in my life, it all seems to make sense.
*  It all works together.
*  What you're saying, it just rings true.
*  I don't know if they're so infected with this ideology that that flies in the face of it.
*  They've rejected it wholeheartedly.
*  The premise of the postmodernists is that there's no uniting metanarrative.
*  If you had to define postmodernism in one phrase, that would be it.
*  And so what have they done?
*  Here's the association with Marxism.
*  So the Marxists have a counter-narrative.
*  It's the narrative of power.
*  And it is a very powerful counter-narrative because if you don't put the proper uniting
*  principle at the pinnacle, power emerges immediately because people play power games.
*  You can attain a certain degree of success and a fair amount of domination by playing
*  a power game.
*  And so Marx observed that one of the cardinal power games is economic.
*  And it is probably the cardinal power game.
*  There's economic disparity.
*  Those at the top do take advantage of their position at the top to stabilize their position.
*  In a functional society, productive people are at the top.
*  But even among those at the top, they're still power-seeking crooks.
*  Now Marx, of course, would say that everyone who's economically successful is a power-seeking
*  crook.
*  And that's a great thing to believe if you're a resentful Satanist like Marx.
*  Well, it's how the losers look at the world.
*  Well, that's for sure.
*  But there is some justification in it because among the successful, there are...
*  Yes.
*  And a large percentage because that's the culture in which they're existing.
*  Yeah, well, a dangerous percentage.
*  A critique of power is always a valid critique.
*  Okay, so what the postmodernists did when Marxism became ethically unacceptable, and
*  that happened in the 1970s, is they just, they metastasized it.
*  They said, okay, we've got a victim-victimizer narrative that's played out in the economic
*  sphere, that's basically Marxism.
*  We'll just multiply that until the same interpretive framework can be applied to all possible group
*  distinctions.
*  That's basically intersectionality.
*  So sex is a oppressor versus oppressed narrative.
*  Gender is an oppressed versus oppressor narrative.
*  Ethnicity, race, ability, attractiveness, height, any qualitative distinction is now
*  recast as a battle between oppressor and oppressed.
*  It's an unbelievably brutal story.
*  It's basically equivalent to the claim that the spirit of power is the ruler of the cosmos.
*  How can they do all this and ignore the possibility of an oppressor, like a male, adopting the
*  identity of the oppressed, of a female, and entering into female spaces and oppressing females?
*  Well, you can see that it can't be dealt with because...
*  Wild, right?
*  That is wild.
*  Look, one of the things you see that's very characteristic of the utopian left is the
*  absolute insistence that anyone oppressed is a victim.
*  It's like, okay, we'll give the devil his due.
*  Some oppressed people are victims, but some people who claim to be oppressed aren't victims.
*  They're the worst kind of monsters that the most deranged imagination could barely conceptualize.
*  Utopian, naive, radical progressives refuse their imagination for evil, and that delivers
*  them into the hands of the absolute bloody psychopaths.
*  And they just don't see it.
*  It's like, oh, those trans people, they're just striving to be free.
*  It's like, you wait, you wait until you have one of them in your house, buddy, and you're
*  going to find out just exactly how naive you are.
*  So how do they protect themselves?
*  They just deny the existence of malevolence or attribute it to socioeconomic inequality.
*  All criminals are victims.
*  It's like, no, first of all, lots of people who are victims aren't criminals.
*  In fact, poverty does not cause criminality.
*  That's a lie.
*  And it's a very damaging lie to the poor, because if poverty was equivalent to criminality,
*  the logical thing to do is just to lock up all the poor.
*  Right.
*  Well, there are many pathways from poverty forward, and one of them is criminality, but
*  you can say the same thing about wealth.
*  So the idea, and that's basically a Marxist theory of causality, is like, well, those
*  people's oppression is what's causing their lack of law-abiding conduct.
*  It's like, no, no, wrong, seriously wrong, and dangerously wrong, and ridiculously naive.
*  That's not how the world works at all.
*  Right.
*  You're also, in a sense, you're encouraging this kind of behaviour, because you're not
*  punishing people for it, because you're saying it's not their fault.
*  Or you're even valorising it.
*  Oh, you poor thing.
*  Right.
*  And you're allowing more of it to take place.
*  Well, we know that, so the dark tetrad types, so those are the subclinical psychopaths.
*  Okay, so they're psychopathic.
*  That makes them predatory and parasitic.
*  That's the definition of a psychopath.
*  Okay, they're narcissistic.
*  So what does that mean?
*  They want unearned social status.
*  Right.
*  They're Machiavellian.
*  So what does that mean?
*  That means that their use of language is subordinated to their demand for hedonistic gratification
*  and power.
*  So like you and I, in principle, we hope, we're trying to pursue a thread of conversation
*  that leads to further development, let's say, for us and for the audience.
*  But I could easily be in here thinking, okay, what the hell do I have to tell Joe to increase
*  my social media status?
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And to play this situation as a game to enhance my own status, or to further my selfishness
*  and desires.
*  That's Machiavellian.
*  That was the dark triad.
*  And further investigation revealed that you had to add an additional dimension to that,
*  to fully flesh out the picture.
*  Sadism.
*  What's that?
*  Positive delight in the unnecessary misery of others.
*  That's the dark tetrad types.
*  Well, dark tetrad types portray themselves as victims.
*  Right?
*  That's one of their Machiavellian strategies.
*  So now your question is, well, how do we segregate the real victims, so to speak, from the false
*  victims?
*  And one of the answers to that is like, beware of those who claim victimization as a justification
*  for their moral, what would you say, for their moral transgressions.
*  I did this because I'm a victim.
*  It's like, really?
*  Right.
*  Really?
*  That was your reason?
*  Poor you.
*  That's your story.
*  You monster.
*  There are no monsters.
*  It's like, if you think there are no monsters, you're naïve and willfully blind to the point
*  of delusion and, what would you call it?
*  What do they say?
*  There are none so blind as those who will not see.
*  That certainly applies on the malevolent side.
*  And then from the point of view of, if you're looking at the people that are committing
*  there's the unfortunate reality that people mimic their environment.
*  And if you grow up in an environment where there are no positive role models and you
*  see nothing but rampant crime around you, even good people go down bad paths.
*  You get, okay, so antisocial personality is somewhat heritable.
*  There is some familial transmission.
*  There is a role played by fatherlessness in particular.
*  And that's perhaps because fatherless boys tend to turn towards a gang orientation and
*  the gangs of adolescents have a short-term time horizon.
*  So they future discount badly and that produces a proclivity for short-term gratification
*  and that includes like idiot criminal behaviour.
*  So what you need in a father, you need someone who encourages intelligent upward aiming sacrifice
*  and an orientation towards others and future development.
*  That's what the spirit of the father really does, is that encouragement.
*  And that reward for delay of gratification.
*  So that's another indication of the relationship between say, upward striving moral orientation
*  and maturity.
*  If you're mature you can delay gratification.
*  What does that mean?
*  It means you've integrated the future into your perceptions.
*  And that has to be socially scaffolded, especially for men.
*  Women they get initiated by nature.
*  In every society that we know of men have to be initiated.
*  Because that catalyzation of maturity is a difficult thing.
*  Difficult and unlikely, but possible and necessary.
*  So how do you reach the people that are young adolescents that are trapped in that vicious
*  cycle?
*  Yeah, well I think I can tell you the answer to that.
*  A lot of young men have been watching and listening to the sorts of things that I've
*  been writing about and producing.
*  And every time someone comes up to me and tells me that reading say, 12 Rules for Life
*  had helped them I ask why?
*  It's like, okay, good.
*  What changed?
*  And the overwhelming pattern of response is something like, I started to understand the
*  necessity of responsibility.
*  Now you might then ask, well you hear from your parents, in principle you hear from the
*  school system, although that's probably gone, that you should grow up and be responsible.
*  Why did it make a difference to you to read that in what I wrote?
*  And the answer is, I think the answer is I didn't take the standard conservative approach.
*  I didn't say you should, you must, you ought, even though those things are true.
*  I said there's no difference between responsibility and adventure.
*  That's a killer thing to know.
*  The heavier the responsibility, the more profound the adventure.
*  And so everyone knows that, but it's not catalyzed.
*  So I just watched The Hobbit a while back, classic adventure story, and of course what,
*  it's Bilbo to begin with, Bilbo.
*  He's this little hobbit, right?
*  Like Abraham, he's living his comfortable life and the wizard comes along and says,
*  it's time for you to develop your shadow side, because of course he becomes a thief, and
*  to go on your adventure.
*  And he agrees to do that.
*  And it's a weighty adventure.
*  He has to contend with the ring of power, right?
*  That's the ultimate in temptations.
*  That's the temptation that Christ is offered by Satan in the desert, the temptation of
*  power.
*  And that's the temptation that Frodo has to, Bilbo has to contend with.
*  Well, he has this adventure.
*  Well, what's the adventure?
*  It's responsibility.
*  He has to carry that ring.
*  And it is one of the rings that unites everything, power.
*  It's just the malevolent ring that unites everything.
*  And so I've been suggesting to young men in particular, it's like you want to get your
*  life together.
*  Take the path of maximal responsibility.
*  Not because you should, even though you should.
*  That's not why.
*  It's because that's the pathway of maximal adventure.
*  So you say, well, what's the meaning of life?
*  It's the meaning that reveals itself when you take the pathway of maximal responsibility.
*  That's exactly the message of the crucifixion.
*  That's precisely the message.
*  Pathway of maximal responsibility.
*  And that's a terrifying thing.
*  There's no difference between that and the dragon and treasure stories that are unbelievably
*  archaic.
*  The greatest possible treasure is to be found where the danger is most intense.
*  Right.
*  Always.
*  Right.
*  The dragon guards the gold.
*  Always.
*  Right.
*  Well, and so one thing to know is that if there's a dragon, there's a treasure somewhere.
*  Really?
*  Right.
*  Really?
*  Right.
*  My family and I have really learned this in the last six years because we were subject
*  to continued and assaults in the public sphere that were designed to be deadly.
*  What do you mean by that?
*  Designed to be deadly?
*  Oh, interviews with journalists in particular.
*  Snake journalists whose every single utterance is designed to entrap the person being interviewed
*  into saying something that will devastate their reputation personally to enhance the
*  status of the interviewer.
*  Like the Kathy Newman conversation.
*  Well, Kathy at least had a bit of a sense of humor.
*  But the intent.
*  Oh, yeah, the intent.
*  That's the serpent.
*  That's the intent.
*  It's like, well, Nellie Bowles who interviewed me for the New York Times, now part of the
*  free press, she admitted that.
*  She said that her job at the New York Times, like the job of many of the reporters, was
*  to find someone, demolish their reputation by any means necessary, and elevate their
*  status in consequence.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  What a terrible job.
*  Brutal.
*  So isn't it terrifying that that's the old gray lady?
*  That's the most trusted and respected source of news?
*  And that their intent was just to destroy?
*  Yeah, it's quite something.
*  The news.
*  It wasn't real journalism.
*  The nuanced various elements of what a human being is.
*  The pros and cons, the goods, the bads, the ugly, the battle that they have.
*  Not that.
*  No, no, no.
*  Not an accurate assessment.
*  Not an objective analysis of the person.
*  Pursuitive status.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's part of that.
*  And the danger is that people know that now.
*  And people know who's doing that now.
*  And then they go after them.
*  And you see that now.
*  And journalists say, oh, it's attack on journalism.
*  You're not doing journalism.
*  You're doing hit pieces.
*  And you're doing it under the guise of journalism.
*  But it's not journalism.
*  It's kind of evil.
*  It's kind of fucked up.
*  Yeah, kind of.
*  I've seen quite a bit of it where I'm like, especially with people that I know the actual
*  story and what was really going on behind the scenes.
*  I was like, this is maddening.
*  This is wild.
*  We started to learn after this had happened two or three times.
*  There's kind of a process, because you're exposed to that.
*  And then there's an intermediary period where it looks like it might succeed.
*  And that's very stressful.
*  That's usually when people come out with their apologies.
*  Because they're just terrified.
*  They're going to lose, well, I did lose my job.
*  And I lost my clinical practice.
*  So the costs are real.
*  So your situation in Canada was that they wanted you to sign up for re-education.
*  Oh no, no.
*  That's already, that's the plan.
*  I couldn't sign up.
*  They said already that I have to do that.
*  But we have an appeal in at the moment that's blocking it.
*  And this is all just, what it affects is what in Canada?
*  What is it?
*  I wouldn't, if I don't undergo the re-education process successfully, they'll suspend my license.
*  Well, also say why.
*  You know, they'll say, well, Dr. Peterson is uneducable.
*  He's unprofessional.
*  He's violated the ethical tenets of his profession.
*  Right.
*  Just because you have a different perspective on things than they do.
*  No, it's because I'm actually telling the truth that clinicians bloody well know and
*  are too cowardly to admit.
*  So you know, they went after me for four reasons, probably.
*  One of them was the entire transcript of the last conversation I had with you.
*  Whoops.
*  Right, that was submitted as a complaint because I was talking about the climate lies.
*  They went after me because of the comments I've made about the trans butchers and liars,
*  the surgeons and the therapists who are enabling them.
*  That's a major part of it.
*  That's a major part of it.
*  They went after me because I went after Trudeau and his former chief of staff.
*  And what else?
*  Those are the major three.
*  There's probably four complaints aligned with each of those dimensions.
*  And so that's cost me about a million dollars in legal fees so far.
*  So it's a very hard battle to fight.
*  It's very annoying because the accusations continue to flow in, even though that's a
*  choice of the college.
*  And I've already been sentenced to re-education of indefinite duration, right, till they're
*  satisfied that I've learned whatever the hell lesson I'm supposed to learn.
*  So the only reason that isn't happening is because we now have an appeal in front of
*  the Supreme Court in Canada.
*  And so I don't think it'll succeed, but we'll see.
*  Is it important to you to maintain your license or is it important to you to win this?
*  It's important.
*  There's two things that are important to me likely.
*  One is I'm not going to let a pack of ideologically addled moralists, lying moralists who are
*  facilitating the butchery and sterilization of children take away my license, not without
*  a war.
*  So that's one thing.
*  The second thing is I'm likely, I'm in a prime position in Canada to undertake this battle
*  against the woke licensing boards because I have the money and what the hell are they
*  going to do to me?
*  I'm not practicing.
*  They can't take away my income and likely they can't blacken my reputation except among
*  those who are willing to assume that the licensing colleges are playing a straight game.
*  So really there's nothing they can do to me.
*  Unless if it was only a personal thing, apart from the fact that I'm not letting my license
*  be taken by a pack of intellectually addled hypocrites, I don't really, there's a part
*  of me that's deeply ashamed to be a psychologist at the moment.
*  I'm so appalled by my compatriots.
*  They know that this gender dysphoria pathology is a lie.
*  They all know it and they won't say anything.
*  Now partly they won't say anything because the consequences for saying something are
*  not trivial.
*  But the consequences for not saying anything is that people like Chloe Cole end up with
*  their breasts cut off when they're 15.
*  Well that actually matters.
*  So practically speaking in a sense the battle doesn't mean anything to me because I'm fighting
*  to remain a member of a club that I don't really want to be part of.
*  But is there a principle at stake?
*  Well there's a variety of principles at stake.
*  And so if I stop or lose all of the woke licensing enterprises, they'll just have their sway.
*  All the physicians in Canada are terrified to say what they think.
*  Anybody who's governed by a professional college, they censor themselves like mad.
*  And it's really appalling for psychologists because all of the psychologists who are properly
*  trained they know that all of this is a lie and not just a lie.
*  A malevolent, vicious and destructive lie.
*  Everything about it's a lie.
*  You know Musk revealed the other day that the professionals that were interacting with
*  him in regard to his transitioning son told him that if he didn't abide by their dictates
*  that his son was much more likely to commit suicide.
*  That's a lie.
*  No one who's educated as a psychologist believes that to be true.
*  No one.
*  At minimum, if you're educated, what you understand is that underneath gender dysphoria is something
*  more substantial, which is a proclivity towards depression and anxiety.
*  If you're depressed and anxious you have a higher risk of suicide.
*  You have to account for that before you attribute any of the remainder to gender dysphoria as
*  such.
*  And everyone who's a psychologist also understands that body focused discomfort for women at
*  puberty is normative.
*  Because when women who have a higher probability of being depressed and anxious do become depressed
*  and anxious it preferentially takes the form of bodily discomfort.
*  That's been known forever.
*  So Chloe Cole for example, no one explained that to her.
*  No one sat her down and said, well you're not very...
*  She told me that the reason she decided to transition was because she kind of had a crush
*  on Kardashian and that body type, you know, hyper curvy, hyper feminine.
*  And Chloe realized when she entered puberty that she was probably going to have a boyish
*  figure.
*  And Chloe's a very attractive person.
*  She would have had no trouble attracting the attention of men.
*  But you know, she was 11, 12, what the hell does she know?
*  And she wasn't going to be the woman she had envisioned.
*  She didn't really understand that, you know, there's a variety of female forms that men
*  find attractive.
*  That's for sure.
*  And she certainly would have fallen into that category.
*  She didn't know that it was typical for girls to undergo a fair bit of confusion when they
*  hit puberty and that that would take the form of negative emotion.
*  No one told her that.
*  They just rushed her down the puberty blocking and surgical pathway.
*  That's inexcusable.
*  It's evil.
*  That is.
*  It's the worst thing.
*  It's the worst thing I've seen professionals do not only in my lifetime.
*  I've studied atrocity for 40 years.
*  I've never seen anything worse than what's happening right now.
*  And that includes the sorts of things that were done in the camps in Germany.
*  At least the goddamn Nazis admitted what they did was wrong.
*  They tried to hide it.
*  We trumpeted it as a moral virtue.
*  We're freeing the children.
*  It's like, no, I don't think so.
*  Mothers, I think what you're doing is sacrificing your child to the parading of your moral
*  virtue.
*  I love my son.
*  He's so confused.
*  He thinks I as a girl, but I still love him.
*  That's how wonderful I am.
*  Jesus Christ, you'll you have no idea how dark that is.
*  It's dark.
*  It's unbelievably dark.
*  It's attached to an industry now.
*  Yeah, that's very scary.
*  There was an industry and an ideology.
*  It was an article that was recently released where this person admitted that they said
*  it was the what was the exact phrase that the way they described gender transition as
*  life saving medical care in order to get insurance for it.
*  Yeah, yeah, because otherwise insurance won't pay for it.
*  So they were willing to describe it in that way to ensure that people would profit off
*  of it, which is wild.
*  It's it's terrifying.
*  And it's so strange because I never would have believed that this could happen.
*  If you had asked me 20 years ago if this was going to be a main concern that people worried
*  about their children being roped into this ideology and convinced that their
*  and then sterilized and mutilated.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  Yeah, yes, I know.
*  I know.
*  Well, it's no wonder people see even Michael Schellenberger, who broke the WPATH files
*  when we talked about the role the WPATH played in establishing their own ideology, addled
*  butchery as the standard of care for the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric
*  Association, the American Psychological Association.
*  Schellenberger said that after he had listened to Abigail Schreier and I talk about this
*  transmutation, he was so appalled that he literally couldn't believe it.
*  He just shelved it.
*  He said there's no way this can be true.
*  And I can understand that because the more you look into it, the worse it gets.
*  It's unbelievably bad.
*  These surgical procedures are so brutal and so experimental that they're they're I'm going
*  to say it again.
*  They're worse than what the Mengele types did in the concentration camps in the 30s
*  and 40s.
*  And that's a pretty goddamn low bar.
*  And it's no wonder people don't want to believe it.
*  And people say the lefties I've talked to, the centrists, well, it doesn't happen very
*  often.
*  It's like, oh, yeah, how often is too often?
*  Like once is too often.
*  And it's not once.
*  That's for sure.
*  No, it's policy.
*  In fact, you're punished by your governing boards if you don't go along with it.
*  And what about the recent law that they passed in California where the schools don't have
*  to tell the parents that the child has transitioned at school?
*  They hide that information from the parents.
*  Well, they're just letting those children be free, you know, those ignored children
*  who are looking desperately for a pathway to what would you call it?
*  Inclusion and celebration.
*  Oh, you're so brave.
*  And then they're encouraged.
*  That's for sure.
*  They're given positive feedback.
*  Yes, definitely.
*  Which is a real thing.
*  Especially if they're alienated kids to begin with.
*  Yeah.
*  And who are unsettled in their identity.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And aren't being guarded by anyone.
*  And are vulnerable.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And the parents are indoctrinated into this whole woke ideology as well.
*  Or terrified.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Indoctrinated or the Munchausen by proxy types who get off on the fact that they have a child
*  that's such a burden but are still really, you know, what would you say, bearing up nobly
*  under the weight.
*  And that is a very dark inclination that is well documented.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's the devouring mother for you.
*  That was what Freud warned about back in like 1880.
*  Yeah.
*  She's a little too close.
*  Do you remember the witch in the Hansel and Gretel story?
*  Yeah.
*  Gingerbread house.
*  That's a little bit too good to be true when you're lost.
*  What's inside it?
*  The witch that wants to fatten you up for her own delectation.
*  That's the devouring mother.
*  That's the maternal instinct gone mad.
*  Right.
*  Everything good has the potential for pathology in proportion to its goodness.
*  So Lucifer is the intellect gone mad.
*  Right.
*  The devouring mother is the mother who's a little too close to her kids.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  A little too close.
*  Jesus.
*  Brutal, Jill.
*  It's just so stunning how widespread it is.
*  At least the UK is pulling back on this stuff, but they have socialized medicine.
*  So they actually have to go on data.
*  Canada hasn't pulled back.
*  Which is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  But I think that's true though.
*  And entirely predictable.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, most of the European countries have woken up, but I don't think it's going to
*  slow it much because there's a huge underground market in puberty blockers.
*  You know, I've talked to experts who figure that the ratio of people on black market puberty
*  blockers to medically prescribed puberty blockers is at least 10 to 1.
*  Oh God.
*  So they're just self-administering this stuff?
*  Yeah, right.
*  Oh God.
*  And essentially chemical castration drugs that they used to use on pedophiles.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh God.
*  Yeah, that's for sure.
*  That's what it is.
*  And when you tell people that and they deny it because they don't know and then they find
*  out it is so stunning.
*  They also don't want to know.
*  Right.
*  And no wonder.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyways, that's why we're trying to educate people.
*  Well Jordan, I'm very happy you're doing this.
*  I really am.
*  It looks amazing.
*  I think it's fantastic.
*  I'm going to try some of them.
*  I'll try some of your courses.
*  It looks exciting.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, let's go down a bit and I'll show you some of them.
*  So we've got Brett and Heather Weinstein.
*  So that's fun.
*  Jonathan Pagio on Symbolism and Christianity.
*  That's excellent.
*  James Orr, he's from Cambridge lecturing on Plato.
*  Marion Toopey on the Economics of Human Flourishing.
*  That's a very optimistic course.
*  There's Brett and Heather, Evolutionary Inference.
*  Is this available currently?
*  It's up now, man.
*  It's up now.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  The Greatest Leaders of History.
*  That's a great course.
*  That's very inspiring.
*  John Vervecky.
*  I really like John.
*  He's so damn smart.
*  Boy Crisis with Warren Farrell.
*  I did a course on Nietzsche on Beyond Good and Evil.
*  Do you want to run that?
*  That's a fun preview.
*  Sure.
*  Let's run that.
*  We'll wrap it up with this.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  I write in a single sentence what it takes other men a book to write.
*  But it wasn't egotistical because it happened to be true.
*  Beyond Good and Evil is a cardinal work, a prodroma to the entire intellectual and political
*  history of the 20th century.
*  Brilliant, romantic, insightful, deep, psyche shattering, dancing bit of literary genius.
*  He's had a remarkable impact on thought over the last 140 years.
*  It's reasonable to say that he philosophized with a hammer because his thought is extraordinarily
*  condensed.
*  To read Nietzsche is daunting psychologically.
*  He's like a motivational speaker.
*  He's practical in the way that philosophers seldom are.
*  Nietzschean philosophy is a call to arms.
*  To familiarize yourself with him is to arm yourself against a sea of trouble.
*  But since you will encounter a sea of troubles, you better pray that you're armed.
*  And this is one way to do it.
*  All right.
*  How to philosophize with a hammer.
*  Jordan, thank you very much, my friend.
*  Hey, man.
*  It's always a pleasure to see you, Joe.
*  It was very fun watching you on Kill Tony, too.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  That was fun.
*  And that was a good opportunity.
*  You were great, too.
*  I can't wait for that to come out because it's fun.
*  No, thank you, sir.
*  It's always a pleasure to be on your show.
*  Always a pleasure to see you.
*  Bye, everybody.
