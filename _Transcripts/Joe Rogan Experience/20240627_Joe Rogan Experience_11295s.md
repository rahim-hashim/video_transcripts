# JRE MMA Show #135 with Paul Felder
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5.72s)]
*  Paul Felder, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10.32s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=13.44s)]
*  I'm good, man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=14.44s)]
*  Thanks for having me, dude. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=15.44s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=16.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=17.44s)]
*  I love what you've done because I think every professional athlete, every fighter, when [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=18.44s)]
*  you're done competition, you need something to drive you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=23.96s)]
*  And you decided to go into triathlons, which I think is fucking awesome. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=27.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=31.8s)]
*  And I kind of, I stumbled upon it. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=33.06s)]
*  I didn't have any idea what I was going to do when it was all said and done. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=35.72s)]
*  I thought, you know, I'll be like everybody else. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  I'll do grappling competitions. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=40.44s)]
*  I'll hit pads. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=42.2s)]
*  I'll stay active. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=43.2s)]
*  But that's still not the same as getting to the cage and actually fighting somebody. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=44.84s)]
*  And I stumbled upon this guy, Lionel Sanders, who I kind of found on YouTube, just looking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=50.72s)]
*  up run workouts because I was getting bored during the pandemic. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=55.64s)]
*  You know, I was going outside. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=59.04s)]
*  I was going for these runs and they were getting boring. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=60.04s)]
*  You just run miles. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=61.68s)]
*  I was like, how do guys do this? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=62.68s)]
*  You're just running to run all the time and there's no structure or anything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=64.48s)]
*  And I found one of his workouts in Arizona where he was running. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=70.4s)]
*  It was like 107 degrees and he's doing like crazy tempo workouts. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=73.4s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  What's a tempo workout? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=80.12s)]
*  Well, like all your runs kind of break down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=81.64s)]
*  You know, you have your easy miles aerobic, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=84.4s)]
*  And then you have where you kind of go a little bit. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=86.76s)]
*  You're not quite going as hard as you're going to go for a race. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=89.0s)]
*  And that's like tempo. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=91.92s)]
*  So you're upping your heart rate into that kind of zone three area where you're keeping [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=92.92s)]
*  it right there. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=97.44s)]
*  You're not going threshold, which, you know, kind of just below all out. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=98.44s)]
*  And he was doing that and it was like 100 and something degrees. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=102.48s)]
*  And I was like, this dude's out of his fucking mind. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=104.68s)]
*  And I started following all his stuff. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And then I started realizing how crazy this sport is. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=109.08s)]
*  If you really watch these guys, I mean, they're freak athletes, these guys. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=111.32s)]
*  Plus MMA, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=114.08s)]
*  Wrestling, jujitsu, kickboxing, boxing, traditional martial arts. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=116.52s)]
*  Well, now I found this other sport that's totally new to me that I know nothing about [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=120.64s)]
*  that I can dive into. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=124.96s)]
*  And it's all these different disciplines. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=126.68s)]
*  So I can be an idiot all over again and not just pick one sport. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=128.68s)]
*  I can do all three of these things. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=132.2s)]
*  And I didn't even know how to swim. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=134.12s)]
*  Yeah, I heard that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=135.12s)]
*  I grew up in South Philly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=136.12s)]
*  Bilal told me. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=137.12s)]
*  Oh, bro, I swam with Bilal. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=138.16s)]
*  If I don't know how to swim, Bilal super doesn't know how to swim. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=140.16s)]
*  He sucks, but he does it just like anything. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=145.4s)]
*  He gets in there. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=148.32s)]
*  He does it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=149.32s)]
*  I've swam with him. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=150.32s)]
*  He's he's done a triathlon. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=151.32s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=152.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=153.32s)]
*  He did it on like a borrowed bike, a borrowed wetsuit, which was like a surfing wetsuit. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=154.32s)]
*  Like not not where you would go and swim in, you know, cold water with for, you know, having [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  any flexibility in your shoulders. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=165.8s)]
*  So these triathlons, like how how long does it take to complete one of those? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=168.36s)]
*  Well, it depends. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=173.68s)]
*  There's sprint distance, which is a really short one. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=174.68s)]
*  I mean, you can do those. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=178.12s)]
*  The guys are doing those like, you know, under an hour, like 45 minutes, 30 minutes, you [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=179.12s)]
*  can do some of them. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=185.28s)]
*  It's like a quarter of a mile swim. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=186.28s)]
*  It'll be like a 10 mile bike and then I think a 5k. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=188.52s)]
*  And you always it's always swim, bike, run, swim, bike, run. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=192.72000000000003s)]
*  And unless you're doing like Super League stuff, which is this other organization that's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=196.4s)]
*  now kind of mixing up the order of which they'll do things. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  A lot of these races, they'll do swim, bike, run, swim, bike, run, swim, bike, run. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=202.92s)]
*  So these dudes are literally and women are tucking their caps in their goggles and stuff [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=208.48s)]
*  while they're riding on the bike and stuff like that. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=213.12s)]
*  And then they pull it back out as they're sprinting to the water, putting their cap [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=215.28s)]
*  back on their goggles and diving in after having just run, you know, probably like sub [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=219.16s)]
*  five minute miles diving back into the water to not be able to breathe correctly. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=224.6s)]
*  She's the scariest thing of it all. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=229.48s)]
*  But the ones I do the most are 70.3. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=231.24s)]
*  So it's like the half Ironman distance. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=234.16s)]
*  So it's 70.3 miles. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=236.94s)]
*  It's 1.2 miles swim, 56 mile bike and then a half marathon. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=238.48s)]
*  She's yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=243.0s)]
*  And I started with that like an absolute that I am. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=244.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, do a sprint, do an Olympic. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=249.12s)]
*  I was like, no, I want to do this one. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=250.84s)]
*  And I did. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=253.95999999999998s)]
*  And I remember the first time I saw you when we're getting ready for a show. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  We were in the green room. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=259.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=260.64s)]
*  Change. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=261.64s)]
*  I remember. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=262.64s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=263.64s)]
*  I'm like, you look like shit. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=264.64s)]
*  I'm like, you want to add or all or something? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=265.64s)]
*  You thought I'd crackhead. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=268.12s)]
*  You look like a crackhead. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=269.68s)]
*  You were so sucked in because I just I had just done that race. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=270.68s)]
*  So when you saw me, I was still trying to even like days ago, I had done that race and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  it's like cutting weight. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=279.68s)]
*  20 pounds running one of those and doing the swim and doing the bike. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=281.56s)]
*  You probably lose about 10 and that's with hydration, hydrating the whole time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=285.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=290.76s)]
*  Whoo. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=291.76s)]
*  And so how far are you going to try to push this? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=292.76s)]
*  To the absolute limits of being an amateur, because I'll never be. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=297.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, these guys, Joe, that do it pro. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=302.04s)]
*  I mean, I don't believe you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=305.36s)]
*  I don't believe you. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=307.52s)]
*  I would love to do it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=308.52s)]
*  You're a psycho. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=309.52s)]
*  But I don't even want to say that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=310.79999999999995s)]
*  I feel like it's disrespectful to the guys that I know that are pro and how fast they [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=311.96s)]
*  are to say that yet. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=316.0s)]
*  All I want to say now is I want to do it and be I want to win age groups. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=318.12s)]
*  And my age group, you know, 35 to 39 is these dudes are fast because they a lot of them [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=323.4s)]
*  come from a collegiate background of some sort of whether it be swimming, cross country, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=329.59999999999997s)]
*  track. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=335.0s)]
*  And then same as me coming from MMA, they don't have that anymore and they find triathlon, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=336.48s)]
*  but they at least have the base of an endurance sport. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=340.72s)]
*  Whereas MMA is not as much as we want to say you have to have great endurance and you do, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=344.2s)]
*  which most guys still seem to don't understand that. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=349.48s)]
*  But it's not the same. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=352.6s)]
*  Like 25 minutes is the longest fight that we could possibly have. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=353.84s)]
*  That's the swim. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=358.12s)]
*  But when you have a guy who has great endurance, they have such an advantage. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=360.4s)]
*  Like Nick Diaz in his prime would put a pace on people that they could not fucking keep [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=365.0s)]
*  up with. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=370.88s)]
*  I remember when Nick Diaz was at his peak when he was in StrikeForce, when he was a [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=371.88s)]
*  champ over there. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=375.72s)]
*  You remember those days? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=376.72s)]
*  Dude, he was putting a fucking pace on people. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=378.32s)]
*  And he would get his ass beat for the first five, 10 minutes of a fight. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=380.4s)]
*  He would force a slugfest. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=384.88s)]
*  So someone would try to go all out. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=386.64s)]
*  And he would be hitting them like 50, 60 percent. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=388.76s)]
*  And then every now and then he digs. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=391.7s)]
*  To the body in particular. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=393.68s)]
*  Like Paul Daly, I think, fight. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=395.88s)]
*  I'll never freak that one. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=397.68s)]
*  I'm like, oh, he's dead. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=399.28s)]
*  He's done. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=400.68s)]
*  There's no chance. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=401.68s)]
*  Paul Daly has the most ridiculous left hand I think I've ever seen in the business. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=402.68s)]
*  And he's so skillful. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=407.84s)]
*  So slick in his maneuvering and the way he sets up uppercuts and hooks. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=409.84s)]
*  His fucking left hand is a weapon, man. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=415.0s)]
*  And he bombed on Nick Diaz. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=417.24s)]
*  He crushed him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=419.32s)]
*  I thought he was done. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  And he just did what the Diaz brothers do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=421.92s)]
*  They take that shit. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=424.32s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=425.32s)]
*  Come on. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=426.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=427.32s)]
*  Crazy how they take it. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=428.32s)]
*  And that's got a... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=429.32s)]
*  Like that demoralizes you, man. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=430.32s)]
*  You're in a cage fight with all these people watching and you got this crazy son of a bitch [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=432.88s)]
*  going, come on, man. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=437.52s)]
*  That's all you got? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=438.52s)]
*  Yeah, come on. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=439.52s)]
*  Hit me again. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=440.52s)]
*  And you're known for knocking dudes out like that? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=441.52s)]
*  You just, your heart immediately, you just shit it out. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=442.52s)]
*  You're like, oh my God. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=445.48s)]
*  I don't know what I'm... [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=446.48s)]
*  Which is credit to Josh Thompson. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=447.96s)]
*  Josh Thompson is the only guy that ever stopped really legit. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=450.20000000000005s)]
*  Pretty shitting right upside that head. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=452.6s)]
*  Legitimately stopped Nate Diaz. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=454.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=455.72s)]
*  Legitimately stopped him. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=456.72s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=457.72s)]
*  But that's like, the way he landed it too was so perfect. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=458.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=461.64000000000004s)]
*  It was like the perfect head kick. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  And he was like bent over. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=463.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  And he still wasn't out out. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  Still wasn't out out. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  Crazy how tough those guys are. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=467.64000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=469.44000000000005s)]
*  I mean, but I think a factor, a giant factor in especially Nick's early success was... [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=470.44000000000005s)]
*  The cardio. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  The cardio. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=477.84000000000003s)]
*  The amount of like long runs and triathlons. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=478.84s)]
*  It does start on lines. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  And they do, I know even just recently a guy, this kid Justin that I trained with did Xterra. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  He did an Xterra race with him. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=488.59999999999997s)]
*  What is an Xterra? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=489.88s)]
*  So it's more like mountain biking, trail running as opposed to the TT bike out on a highway [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=491.08s)]
*  type, the waters are a little bit more rugged. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=499.08s)]
*  It'll be a little bit colder, crazier areas that you're racing in. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=503.12s)]
*  So it's a little more like wilderness type racing, but it's still a triathlon, still [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=507.44s)]
*  swim bike run. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=510.56s)]
*  But you'll be up and down, you'll be running through trails and like through trees and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=512.28s)]
*  over stuff like that. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=516.64s)]
*  Running from bears, swimming away from sharks. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=517.64s)]
*  Don't talk about it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=520.56s)]
*  I was just in Rio and I was swimming in the ocean every day. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  And I know everybody's like, oh, there's no sharks there. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=524.84s)]
*  Are there no sharks there? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=527.76s)]
*  You can't help it when you're swimming in the open water, you kind of... [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=528.76s)]
*  I had like a can of soda brushed by me at one point and I almost pooped myself. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=531.72s)]
*  I swear to God. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=537.24s)]
*  My friend Peter Atiyah, he swam all the Hawaiian Islands. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=538.4s)]
*  He did this crazy swim and he was training for this in San Diego. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=543.2s)]
*  And I think the week he was training, some guy got eaten by a great white shark. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=548.44s)]
*  So he's out there in the very waters where a guy got bit in half. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=554.28s)]
*  And apparently they were all training for a triathlon, these people that were doing [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=559.12s)]
*  it. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=562.16s)]
*  So there was like a run of them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=563.16s)]
*  There was like 10, 15 guys swimming and just one of them. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=564.16s)]
*  My first race this year is in Oceanside. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  Where's Oceanside? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=573.12s)]
*  It's like outside of San Diego. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=574.12s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=575.52s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=576.52s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=577.52s)]
*  Yeah, April 1st. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=578.52s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=579.52s)]
*  April 1st. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=580.52s)]
*  It's an ocean swim. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=581.52s)]
*  Fuck all that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=582.52s)]
*  I was in Maui last November and a buddy of mine was just there this past... [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=583.52s)]
*  Duncan was there like when? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=592.4399999999999s)]
*  Like two months ago? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=593.72s)]
*  And some lady was snorkeling with her husband and the guy pops his head up and they're screaming [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=594.72s)]
*  at him from the shore. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=599.5600000000001s)]
*  Get back on shore. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=600.5600000000001s)]
*  And he looks over and there's all this blood in the water and thrashing. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  He gets to the shore and he realizes it's his wife. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=604.4000000000001s)]
*  They never even found her. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=606.72s)]
*  Yeah well, because she's gone. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=608.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=611.5600000000001s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=612.5600000000001s)]
*  Diver decapitated by 19 foot great white shark in the Gulf of California, report says. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=614.2s)]
*  Local divers have been warned about the presence of sharks in the area. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=619.7800000000001s)]
*  Fuck that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=622.92s)]
*  Does this just happen? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=623.92s)]
*  Yeah, January 5th. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=624.92s)]
*  Oh. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=625.92s)]
*  They paid him extra money to go down because no one would go get the mollusks. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=626.92s)]
*  So he went and didn't make it back out. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=630.28s)]
*  Oh my mollusks. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  Like what kind of mollusks? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=633.3199999999999s)]
*  And also I guess they're 20 meters down or so. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  10 to 20 meters down. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=638.8s)]
*  So he was down pretty specific. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=639.8s)]
*  So he's down really low in a 19 foot shark. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=641.3399999999999s)]
*  Decapitated him? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=645.3199999999999s)]
*  36 to 39 feet actually. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=646.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=647.3199999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=649.3199999999999s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  Fuck that, Paul Felder. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=651.96s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=653.96s)]
*  Can't wait for that swim. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=654.96s)]
*  And the best part is we wear black wetsuits that make us look like big old seals flopping [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=655.96s)]
*  around. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=661.24s)]
*  Do you have to wear a black one? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=662.24s)]
*  Can't you wear like a neon green one? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=663.24s)]
*  I mean if you can find a bright, I don't know, do sharks see? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=664.24s)]
*  Do they see color though? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=668.1600000000001s)]
*  They probably don't see shit. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=669.48s)]
*  Black and white. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=670.72s)]
*  So that pink one is white I guess to them. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=671.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the underbelly of something delicious. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=673.7600000000001s)]

*  They're like oh by the way this was sitting on the side of the lake that you guys are [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=692.2800000000001s)]
*  swimming in just waiting for us to finish. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=695.96s)]
*  If you're in Florida virtually any body of water could have an alligator. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=698.0400000000001s)]
*  Could have 100%. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=701.72s)]
*  Which is so weird. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=702.72s)]
*  It could be like in a development and there's like a little pond and they might just be [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=703.72s)]
*  like oh I'm just gonna go take a splash in here. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=706.6s)]
*  Oh yeah I remember like a year ago some old lady who was walking in this beautiful gated [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=708.5999999999999s)]
*  community in North Carolina and she got snatched up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=715.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they'll eat dogs and stuff like that. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=717.5999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=719.16s)]
*  I used to live in Gainesville and when I lived there back then alligators were endangered [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=720.16s)]
*  so you couldn't kill them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=726.28s)]
*  So they were everywhere. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=727.9799999999999s)]
*  And people would feed them marshmallows. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=729.4799999999999s)]
*  There's a place called Lake Alice. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=731.1199999999999s)]
*  We'd go to Lake Alice and throw marshmallows into the water. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=732.88s)]
*  I wonder why marshmallows of all things. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=735.5999999999999s)]
*  They found out they would eat them so they'd throw them in. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=739.12s)]
*  Throw some graham crackers at them. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  They eat chicken too. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=743.0799999999999s)]
*  They eat meat. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  Whatever the fuck you want to feed them. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  That's what I would think. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=746.0799999999999s)]
*  I would think protein. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=747.0799999999999s)]
*  But they're fucking monsters. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=748.0799999999999s)]

*  That mess kept him alive through that entire journey. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=833.3199999999999s)]
*  Three days lost in a swamp with no arm. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=836.0s)]

*  You're not going to get eaten inside of the octagon. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=859.96s)]
*  I mean it's definitely a safe environment as far as MMA. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=862.44s)]
*  You just got to deal with the other maniac in there that's trying to kill you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=865.12s)]

*  Because you retired in like prime age. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=872.28s)]
*  Like how old were you when you first decided? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=874.96s)]

*  But I started late too. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=887.0s)]
*  I didn't turn professional until I was 28 I think. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=889.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=892.8000000000001s)]

*  too hard. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=920.5999999999999s)]

*  There's not much going on. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=980.52s)]
*  And a buddy of mine that I used to train with took an amateur fight. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=981.52s)]
*  I used to kind of get the better of him and he went and did well on this amateur fight [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=986.14s)]
*  down in down in Atlantic City. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=989.98s)]
*  New breed fighting was what it was called. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=991.94s)]
*  And I was like I could I could do that. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=995.06s)]

*  You're walking out to fight somebody else. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1007.7s)]
*  I remember having migraines. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1011.02s)]
*  I remember like vomiting afterwards. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1012.66s)]

*  And so a year later I signed up for another one following summer. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1032.34s)]
*  New breed. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1035.86s)]
*  But I knew what to do now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1037.0s)]
*  So I trained properly. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1038.3s)]
*  I went to a Muay Thai school to train for it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1039.38s)]
*  I did jujitsu for it and I beat the crap out of this kid in my second fight. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1041.86s)]
*  Leg kicked the dog shit out of him and it was a decision. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1046.46s)]
*  But I was like all right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1049.6599999999999s)]
*  That was cleaner. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  Then I did another one and now I thought I was too cool for school and I got choked out [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1052.6599999999999s)]
*  in my third amateur fight. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1057.26s)]
*  Got triangle choked by this kid Max Bohannon who was like a prodigy from he was from Ricardo [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1058.7s)]
*  Almeida school and trained with him and he choked the shit out of me. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1065.22s)]
*  And then I was like okay now I got to start doing real grappling and real jujitsu and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1070.7s)]
*  I started training with jujitsu schools and stuff like that. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1075.22s)]
*  And I did one more amateur fight. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1077.46s)]
*  Spinning back kick to the liver. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1079.14s)]
*  I knocked this kid out in my fourth amateur fight and then I went pro because the rules [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1080.14s)]
*  in PA shin guards, big huge puffy gloves, two minute rounds. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1083.82s)]
*  The hell are you supposed to do as a striker with two minutes? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1089.82s)]
*  You're a wrestler? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1091.8600000000001s)]
*  You get one takedown. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1093.3s)]
*  You won the round. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1094.5800000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1095.5800000000002s)]
*  I was like okay I'll do one pro fight just to say I was a pro athlete. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1097.46s)]
*  Just to say that I did it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1103.3s)]
*  Honest to God that's why I did it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1104.78s)]
*  I was like I'm going to go back to acting and I was still doing professional shows in [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1105.78s)]
*  between getting ready for fights. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1110.1799999999998s)]
*  Won the fight flying me. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1113.86s)]
*  TKO the dude. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1115.74s)]
*  They took him out on a stretcher. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1117.3s)]
*  It was for CFFC. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1119.24s)]
*  They had to stop the show because they only had one ambulance. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  So the ambulance had to take the guy and shout out to M. Tumi Goodrum, you're still the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1124.6s)]
*  man but they took him out and they had to wait for the ambulance to come back so I stopped [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1128.52s)]
*  the show in my first pro fight. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1134.28s)]
*  One ambulance? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1138.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah they took him out on a stretcher. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1139.8799999999999s)]
*  One ambulance. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1142.7199999999998s)]
*  They never did that again. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1143.7199999999998s)]
*  They never did that again. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1145.08s)]
*  If anything I show them you need to have two ambulances at these things. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1147.6s)]
*  So you get some fights in some small organizations. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1151.14s)]
*  And then how old? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1154.66s)]
*  Mainly Cage Fury who you know thank God that's kind of who I stumbled upon. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1155.66s)]
*  So I was already kind of with one of the better regional promotions to begin with. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1161.5800000000002s)]
*  I lucked out with that. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1166.3400000000001s)]
*  I fought in Pittsburgh I think once or twice and then yeah I fought for CFFC. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1167.3400000000001s)]
*  And how many fights did you have before you got into the UFC? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1173.6200000000001s)]
*  I was 8-0. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1176.8600000000001s)]
*  I was 8-0 when I got signed. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1178.58s)]
*  I think I had like six knockouts, a bunch in the first round and that's when I started [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1181.8999999999999s)]
*  putting the acting way on the back burner. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1189.74s)]
*  I was like wow I might actually be able to get into the UFC. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1193.06s)]
*  That was never, I mean never the goal was to get in the UFC from the beginning. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1197.78s)]
*  But then once I started winning I always trained my ass off. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1203.5400000000002s)]
*  Just like I am with triathlon or whether it be acting, whether it be fighting, commentary. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1207.14s)]
*  I'm trying to put myself into it. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1212.38s)]
*  The wind started coming and then I remember I knocked out this kid in Atlantic City in [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1216.42s)]
*  my last fight with CFFC. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1223.0600000000002s)]
*  Spinning hook kick. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1225.5s)]
*  Yeah this is it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1226.5s)]
*  Bam. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1228.74s)]
*  I got more damage from the ref throwing me into the cage than I did in that whole fight. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1230.34s)]
*  What did you weigh here? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1236.74s)]
*  That's 155. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1238.26s)]
*  I was just smaller. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1239.26s)]
*  You know years, dude think about, you know how it is, the years and years of you doing [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1241.46s)]
*  strength and conditioning and you building up those muscles and your bones get denser [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1245.98s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1249.5s)]
*  So by the time I got to the UFC plus the lightweights were so big I remember thinking I have to [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1250.5s)]
*  be bigger than these guys. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1258.02s)]
*  And I had this complex that I had to weigh so much so I would go and get so fat in between [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1259.26s)]
*  fights. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1264.02s)]
*  That's one regret I have. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1265.02s)]
*  Looking back I would have stayed leaner and in better shape all year round and not done [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1266.62s)]
*  the drastic weight cuts that I did. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1271.86s)]
*  Is that like the thing that you worry the most about? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1274.34s)]
*  We were talking about that earlier. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1276.62s)]
*  Well I know for sure that I've hurt my kidneys to the point where even after fights, I've [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1278.3799999999999s)]
*  had Rabdo after the Dan Hooker fight. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1285.1s)]
*  I was like peeing Coca-Cola and they made me stay in the hospital for like an extra [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1287.34s)]
*  day or two to monitor my kidneys. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1292.86s)]
*  I almost had, I almost had compartment syndrome from that fight. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1294.62s)]
*  They were going to have to slice my calf open. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1298.8999999999999s)]
*  I've obviously lost a piece of my lung in the James Vick fight. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1301.22s)]
*  How'd that happen? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1305.7s)]
*  The end of the fight he knees me and it pushed in my rib cage. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1307.18s)]
*  A lot of people thought my rib cage broke. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1313.5s)]
*  Everything broke but I had a, they call it like a bleb on your lung that you would only [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1315.78s)]
*  know about if somebody went in there or something happened to it. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1321.74s)]
*  So it's like a bubble that naturally forms on your lungs and it's okay unless something [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1325.54s)]
*  hits it. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1331.5s)]
*  Well that knee just so happened to hit right on that spot and it just so happened that [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1332.5s)]
*  I had this thing on my lung and it burst. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1338.34s)]
*  So it collapsed my lung. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1342.5s)]
*  And since it collapsed that part of my lung was then damaged and it wouldn't normally [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1345.4s)]
*  if you like fall really hard doing snowboarding or something like that or if you're rock climbing [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1349.8400000000001s)]
*  you fall and you land on your ribs you can puncture them by breaking your ribs or you [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1355.16s)]
*  can just, the impact can kind of almost like blow it out. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1360.5600000000002s)]
*  And a lot of times they'll go back on their own. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  Like they'll reinflate. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1366.64s)]
*  Your lungs will kind of heal themselves or they put, they call it like a pigtail or something. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1368.52s)]
*  They inserted this tube down into my lung which was like a vacuum. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1374.88s)]
*  It would suck the air around my lung and my chest wall out forcing the lung to go back [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1378.96s)]
*  around where it was supposed to. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  And that wouldn't work. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1388.64s)]
*  So like three days went by. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1389.64s)]
*  They did that for a couple days. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1391.38s)]
*  It wasn't working. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1392.88s)]
*  Then finally the surgeons came in. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1393.88s)]
*  They're like we're going to have to go in, find where the bleb was, cut it out, staple [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1395.0s)]
*  your lungs shut and then adhere your lung to your chest wall. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1401.36s)]
*  So my left lung is attached to my, the inside of my chest wall. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1406.28s)]
*  Like an elephant. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1414.6799999999998s)]
*  Apparently elephants, their lungs are actually attached to the inside of their chest wall. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1415.6799999999998s)]
*  So this lung, like if you stabbed me here and it would never fully collapse again. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1420.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1425.32s)]
*  I'm like a superhero on this side. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1426.32s)]
*  Does it change the way you move? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1428.6s)]
*  Except for the inch that I'm missing from it. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Does it change the way your body moves? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1431.9599999999998s)]
*  You feel it? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1433.6s)]
*  No, I will get a cramp every now and then in the surgery area that they have. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1434.6s)]
*  I still have a scar. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1439.04s)]
*  It goes right across like Jesus. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1440.04s)]
*  Like where they, it's like right along here. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1441.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1444.6s)]
*  That was miserable, dude. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1445.6s)]
*  That, and that was one, that's one of the many things I know we kind of went on a tangent [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1446.6s)]
*  but retirement was like, I can't. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1449.8s)]
*  You broke your forearm in the Mike Perry fight. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1452.8s)]
*  Broke my forearm and now when you guys called that one nice, you could tell by the way I [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1455.52s)]
*  was, I was holding my hand funny and I remember in between rounds going like this and I could [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1458.56s)]
*  feel the bones crunching together on the side. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1463.3999999999999s)]
*  And I told Duke, I was like, he's like, I know baby, I know. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  It's so common with the spinning backfists. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1470.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1472.9199999999998s)]
*  So common. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1474.2s)]
*  And then you know what's dumber is throwing it like eight more times in the same fight. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1475.2s)]
*  And I remember you and I think it was you and Dom like, Oh God, stop throwing that arm. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1479.12s)]
*  How many people have done that? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1485.48s)]
*  So many people have shattered their forearm. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1486.8s)]
*  Dom had done that in training. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1488.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1490.72s)]
*  Which is why when he's calling with you, he's, he's gone, he knows exactly what it feels [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1491.72s)]
*  like. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1497.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1498.2s)]
*  Stupid man. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1499.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1500.2s)]
*  Spitting backfist and catching that forearm to the forehead. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1501.2s)]
*  Right on the forearm. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1503.24s)]
*  So common. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1504.24s)]
*  Just snaps in a hat. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1505.24s)]
*  I mean, such a, obviously. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1506.24s)]
*  Your forehead is so freaking dense. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1507.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1509.68s)]
*  You get that. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1510.68s)]
*  You get a lot of breaks from checking kicks incorrectly or blocking kicks incorrectly. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1511.68s)]
*  I love that. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1517.2s)]
*  I regret never getting injury wise. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1518.92s)]
*  I know it sounds silly to say, but the slices on the shin that you see all these guys getting [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1520.24s)]
*  from checking kicks and their shin is just like pouring blood. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1524.72s)]
*  Bro, whose shins are harder than Jan Bohovic? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  That Anglia fight. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1532.04s)]
*  He's just like going shin to shin with him. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1535.6000000000001s)]
*  Like, holy fuck man. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1536.6000000000001s)]
*  Polish guys, man. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  But it's him. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1538.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if it's all Polish guys, but that motherfucker made out of wood. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1539.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1542.6000000000001s)]
*  He's different. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1543.6000000000001s)]
*  He just went shin to shin with him. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1544.6000000000001s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1546.88s)]
*  That was very, very impressive because we were like, this is crazy. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1548.5600000000002s)]
*  That hurts, man. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  You've done, you've gone shin. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1553.3600000000001s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1554.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1555.96s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1556.96s)]
*  And he's just cracking them, just getting in there with it. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1557.96s)]
*  It's like baseball, two baseball bats just. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1558.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1561.72s)]
*  And people, it's like when you see people kind of criticize, oh, the leg kicks are not [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1562.72s)]
*  that bad. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1566.44s)]
*  It's like. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1567.44s)]
*  Oh, you don't know. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1568.44s)]
*  Bro, you have no idea. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1569.44s)]
*  Anybody who says that, let me kick you. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1570.44s)]
*  Just one time. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1571.68s)]
*  Just let me kick you one time. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1572.68s)]
*  One time. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1573.68s)]
*  I won't even do it all the way. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1574.68s)]
*  No. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1575.68s)]
*  I'll kick you 50%. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1576.68s)]
*  They deserve 50%. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1578.48s)]
*  Imagine the calf kick. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1579.48s)]
*  Give them just 20% of a calf kick. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1580.48s)]
*  It's like, do you like walking? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1583.1200000000001s)]
*  I've only been calf kicked fucking around. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1584.1200000000001s)]
*  I've never, I've never calf kicked either in training or in a fight because there was [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1586.0s)]
*  no calf kicks back then. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1590.28s)]
*  Like Bisping told me he went his entire career without getting calf kicked. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1592.1200000000001s)]
*  No, of course. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1594.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1595.92s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1596.92s)]
*  The first time that I had actually, the first time I ever experienced it was when I fought, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1597.92s)]
*  you remember Mark Stevens from the Ultimate Fighter? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1604.8s)]
*  No. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1607.48s)]
*  Way back in the day. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1608.48s)]
*  He was on like Team Koschek. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1609.48s)]
*  I fought him outside of the UFC before I got in. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1610.8s)]
*  And he was training down at ATT. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1614.1999999999998s)]
*  And those guys have been throwing that calf kick for a long time. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1616.76s)]
*  And he was, he probably landed about four or five. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1620.8799999999999s)]
*  And I remember thinking like, what is he doing? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1625.08s)]
*  He's missing my thigh. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1627.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1629.24s)]
*  But then I remember like kind of moving around in the second round. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1630.24s)]
*  Like, holy shit, this is cramping up really bad. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1633.28s)]
*  And luckily I got him out of there. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1636.56s)]
*  But that was the first. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1638.36s)]
*  And then Dan Hooker was the other time that I had really been. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1639.76s)]
*  Dan Hooker's very good at it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1641.96s)]
*  He's very good at it. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1643.3999999999999s)]
*  Because he just places it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1644.3999999999999s)]
*  He just touches you. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1645.3999999999999s)]
*  And you're like, oh, that wasn't that hard. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1647.36s)]
*  Benson Henderson was the first. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1649.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1650.6799999999998s)]
*  He was the first guy that I ever saw use it in the UFC. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1651.6799999999998s)]
*  He also would punch you in the thigh. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1652.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't know how effective that one was. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1654.24s)]
*  Anderson used to do that too for fucking around. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1656.8799999999999s)]
*  But Benson was the first guy that I ever saw that like regularly threw calf kicks. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1659.24s)]
*  But for whatever reason, it didn't have the kind of effect that you're seeing with guys [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1663.92s)]
*  now. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1668.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1669.68s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1670.68s)]
*  I don't know if they're placing it more effectively on, because where it really hurts is like [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1671.68s)]
*  right next to your shin bone. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1676.3200000000002s)]
*  Like that, just all that meat and the nerves that goes right along the bone. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1678.04s)]
*  So it looks like a lot of times you'll hear guys, oh, nice check. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1683.24s)]
*  It's like, he didn't check that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1686.8000000000002s)]
*  Because all it just has to touch that muscle on the side of your shin bone. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1689.24s)]
*  So it looks like you checked it. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1692.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1694.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, I think the casuals got woken up to it in the Dustin Poirier, Conor McGregor fight. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1695.4199999999998s)]
*  In that fight, where you just see how he's just so compromised. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1700.54s)]
*  And even fights where you don't think that the guy's compromised, like Adesanya Pahara. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1704.46s)]
*  Israel said after the fight, he's like, you fucked my leg up. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1709.7s)]
*  My leg was useless. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1711.98s)]
*  Yeah, you watch it in the replay. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1712.98s)]
*  I didn't notice it even, because I was upstairs watching it. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1713.98s)]
*  And then when they started showing the highlights later on, I was like, well, he like went down [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1717.26s)]
*  from the one check too. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1720.54s)]
*  So he checked it really weird. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1722.3s)]
*  And he got capped. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1723.7s)]
*  Well, he kind of tripped over his foot and then went down. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1724.7s)]
*  So we said, oh, he just stumbled. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1727.78s)]
*  But it was really because his leg wasn't working well. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1729.34s)]
*  Already. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1731.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1732.74s)]
*  It was the first round. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1733.74s)]
*  I watched that fight several times. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1734.74s)]
*  Apparently so has Alex Pareda made Glover watch it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1737.26s)]
*  Every time he comes over, apparently he puts it on. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1742.3s)]
*  I watched it again, and it's that first round. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1747.06s)]
*  He fucking really chops at it. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1750.18s)]
*  He's got a very strange style. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1752.46s)]
*  It's very uniquely Pareda. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1754.86s)]
*  His, yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1756.58s)]
*  The stand up style, it's very different. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1757.62s)]
*  Like his hands, he stands like this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1759.94s)]
*  He's just freakishly long and big for that weight class. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1762.86s)]
*  And his power is preposterous. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1766.94s)]
*  You can tell. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1768.1s)]
*  You ever see some of those guys, like when you look at certain skinny guys, and I'm not [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1769.1s)]
*  calling him, he's not like a... [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1772.02s)]
*  He's lean. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1774.42s)]
*  But he's lean. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1775.42s)]
*  Tall and lean. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1776.42s)]
*  Are the guys I worry about. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1777.8200000000002s)]
*  Because it's those guys that hit freakishly hard that it's... [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1779.8200000000002s)]
*  The big muscle guys, you know that guy's going to hit you hard. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1783.8200000000002s)]
*  But it's these sneaky tall lean guys. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1786.3000000000002s)]
*  Those Tommy Hearns looking dudes. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1788.14s)]
*  When they turn into those hooks, his left hook. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1791.0600000000002s)]
*  So much torque and leverage. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1793.66s)]
*  His fucking left hook is a thing of beauty, man. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1795.66s)]
*  It really is. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1798.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, his... [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1799.0600000000002s)]
*  Everything is fucking sick. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1801.66s)]
*  Scary dude. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1802.94s)]
*  He's such a scary guy. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1803.94s)]
*  The high level kickboxing experience that he has, like coming over from glory. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1805.66s)]
*  I'm very interested to see what Israel does different in the second fight. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1811.26s)]
*  But I'm really interested in seeing him against someone who can wrestle. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1814.8600000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm really interested in. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1818.26s)]
*  I was just going to say, it's kind of working out perfectly for Alex where you get another [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1819.26s)]
*  shot. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1826.0600000000002s)]
*  You get to go and face Israel again. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1827.0600000000002s)]
*  That's the best matchup for you. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1828.7800000000002s)]
*  You've got a guy that is probably going to stand with you for as long as the fight lasts. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1830.38s)]
*  When he's really going to get challenged is when he has somebody that's going to say, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1836.1000000000001s)]
*  that. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1839.66s)]
*  Marvin Vittori. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1840.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1841.66s)]
*  I'm going to grapple your ass. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1842.66s)]
*  I'm going to pressure you up against the fence. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1843.66s)]
*  And for guys like Vittori, it's got to be like, all right, they want him to stay the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1845.8200000000002s)]
*  champ. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1849.5800000000002s)]
*  Because Izzy already had their number and he's been there. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1850.9s)]
*  But as long as Paredes in there, another kickboxer, but with a different style, maybe not as [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1854.18s)]
*  much experience in the grappling department, they're chomping at the bit to get in there. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1860.34s)]
*  Well, not necessarily chomping at the bit. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1863.98s)]
*  He's fucking scary. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1866.1799999999998s)]
*  Robert Whitaker, you know, Whitaker's very well-rounded. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1868.4599999999998s)]
*  He's an interesting matchup for him. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1871.98s)]
*  There's very good matchups in that 185 pound division. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1873.58s)]
*  But in my opinion, what's interesting is he's a specialist. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1877.4199999999998s)]
*  He's like a pure specialist. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1881.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1883.06s)]
*  I mean, he can grapple a little bit, but that's not what he wants to do. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1884.06s)]
*  He wants to knock your fucking head into the bleachers. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1888.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1890.5s)]
*  And you know it going in. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1891.5s)]
*  You know that's what he wants to do to you. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1892.5s)]
*  We just try to, I mean, Izzy was winning that fight and he still got him out of there. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1894.9s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1900.9s)]
*  I remember even saying to the people when we were watching it up in the ESPN desk, we're [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1902.0600000000002s)]
*  like, man, could you imagine if he pulls it off here in the end? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1905.14s)]
*  And he fucking did it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1908.5s)]
*  Yeah, he did it. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1909.74s)]
*  Izzy was probably ahead three, well, how many rounds do you think he was ahead going into [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1910.74s)]
*  that fifth round? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1915.7800000000002s)]
*  That was the fifth. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1917.54s)]
*  And I think even that round was that who I don't remember now. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1918.8s)]
*  Well, Izzy definitely won the first and almost knocked him out. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1922.14s)]
*  I think he had probably two or three rounds. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1925.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard to say. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1928.66s)]
*  I'd have to go back and try to score it. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1930.86s)]
*  Which I'm terrible at, man. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1933.86s)]
*  People are always like, what did you think? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1935.38s)]
*  I'm like, I'm calling the fight. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1936.74s)]
*  Yeah, you can't call and score at the same time. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1938.14s)]
*  When you're scoring a fight, you should shut your mouth. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1941.02s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1943.38s)]
*  So Izzy had three rounds on Eric Colen's card, on Sal Diamada's card, he had three [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1944.38s)]
*  rounds and he also had three rounds on Mike Bell's. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1951.2600000000002s)]
*  All the same, too. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1955.42s)]
*  All he had to do was move around. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1956.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1958.3400000000001s)]
*  All he had to do was move around. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1959.3400000000001s)]
*  And not get caught. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1960.3400000000001s)]
*  Not get caught and he wins that fight. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1961.3400000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1963.7800000000002s)]
*  I'm very interested in the rematch. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1966.0200000000002s)]
*  Because you got to think, Izzy almost had him out in the first round, man. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1968.22s)]
*  He almost had him out. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1973.02s)]
*  If he could avoid getting that leg compromised like he did in the first round of that fight. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1974.5s)]
*  And so he's got his movement. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1980.58s)]
*  And he also had some great moments grappling, which surprised a lot of people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1983.22s)]
*  When he had Paredes back. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1987.7s)]
*  If there's a time that you're going to pull out some grappling, it's in that matchup. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1989.3s)]
*  And he's been at it longer than Paredes. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1994.7s)]
*  So it's like, that's the time to show. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1996.94s)]
*  And he did. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1998.42s)]
*  Both guys did. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=1999.92s)]
*  I think score takedowns at one point or another in that fight. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2001.0800000000002s)]
*  I remember being like, oh, now there are wrestlers in here. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2003.1200000000001s)]
*  You get two guys that know they can knock the crap out of each other. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2005.8400000000001s)]
*  And suddenly everybody knows how to do a little bit of wrestling. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2008.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, just mixing it up. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2011.04s)]
*  Just keeping someone guessing overload their brain. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2013.0s)]
*  Yeah, 25 minutes of avoiding that left hook. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2016.2s)]
*  Whew. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  Scary proposition. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2020.3600000000001s)]
*  It's everything, man. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  Everything he hits you with is hard. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2023.0800000000002s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2024.48s)]
*  Those lean guys like that. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2026.0s)]
*  You know those shins hurt. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2027.0s)]
*  You know if he lands an elbow. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2028.72s)]
*  Same as Izzy. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2030.42s)]
*  They're a similar build. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2031.42s)]
*  But Alex has more muscle on him. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2033.5s)]
*  He's quite a bit bigger. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2036.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think Paredes, when he actually weighed into the fight, was above 220. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2037.3400000000001s)]
*  When he was inside the octagon for the fight was above 220. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2043.1000000000001s)]
*  Whereas you got to remember when Izzy fought Jan Bojovic for the light heavyweight title, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2047.02s)]
*  he was only 194. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2050.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2051.86s)]
*  Izzy is one of those guys that- [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2052.86s)]
*  He's not cutting that much weight. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2055.3s)]
*  He's not cutting any weight. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2056.42s)]
*  And even when he wanted to go up to light heavyweight, he's like, I'm not cutting any [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2057.42s)]
*  weight. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2060.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to fight as I fight. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2061.2999999999997s)]
*  Which makes sense. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2062.2999999999997s)]
*  Especially if you're not planning on making that transition permanently, you don't want [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2063.2999999999997s)]
*  to go and add on all that size. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2067.34s)]
*  And the other thing that drives me nuts about when I hear these fighters, and I think it's [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2068.98s)]
*  really the strength and conditioning coaches feeding bullshit more than it is the fighters. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2073.82s)]
*  They're just listening to what they're being told. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2077.54s)]
*  But you don't put on 20 pounds of muscle in a month. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2079.18s)]
*  You ever hear these guys in fighter meetings, we'll be talking to them and be like, well, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2083.5s)]
*  you know, I put on about 10 pounds of lean muscle mass for this camp. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2086.54s)]
*  Like this particular camp? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2089.86s)]
*  In six weeks. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2091.18s)]
*  You put on 10 pounds of muscle mass. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2092.18s)]
*  How are you going to pass your piss test? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2094.46s)]
*  What supplements are you taking for that? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2097.9s)]
*  Hair quotes, air quotes, supplements. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2099.7s)]
*  You didn't put on 10 pounds of muscle. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2102.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot of weight. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2104.18s)]
*  You're out of your mind. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2105.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2106.18s)]
*  Yeah, you probably gained some water weight. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2107.18s)]
*  It's also, it's like- [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2108.74s)]
*  You got stronger. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2109.74s)]
*  What kind of scanning are they doing of their body composition before they say these things? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2110.74s)]
*  It's the coach doing the eyeball scan saying, you put on 10 pounds of muscle for this one. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2115.62s)]
*  Well, you know, I always go back to the Roy Jones Jr. Ruiz fight when he fought John Ruiz. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2120.1s)]
*  He went up to heavyweight, remember? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2126.74s)]
*  He got very muscular. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2128.9s)]
*  He was real big. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2130.22s)]
*  He was about, I mean, he wasn't too heavy for a heavyweight. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2131.22s)]
*  I want to say Roy weighed like 200 pounds, just a little over 200 pounds maybe. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2134.58s)]
*  See what he weighed for that John Ruiz fight. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2139.34s)]
*  Does it say? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2141.5s)]
*  193. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2142.5s)]
*  Oh, was he really? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2143.5s)]
*  That's all he weighed? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2144.5s)]
*  Well, the heavyweight for- [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2145.5s)]
*  That says that, but I think- [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2146.5s)]
*  The heavyweight for boxing is different, right? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2148.46s)]
*  That says that, but I think that's now. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2149.46s)]
*  They're saying now he weighs 193. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2150.94s)]
*  What did he weigh when he fought John Ruiz? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2154.42s)]
*  Does it say there? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2158.14s)]
*  Oh, he said he weighed 193 and Ruiz was 226. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2162.34s)]
*  Oh, he's 226, yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2166.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2167.5s)]
*  But, you know, Roy was so fucking talented. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2168.5s)]
*  But when Roy went down in weight and then fought Tarver in his next fight, he looked [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2171.34s)]
*  like he was really deflated. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2176.58s)]
*  He looked like he had just really drained himself to make that weight cut. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2177.58s)]
*  Yeah, that's why you see these guys drop down, man. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2181.38s)]
*  Looked terrible and then got knocked out. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2183.94s)]
*  Very few people can do it. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2185.62s)]
*  Jose Aldo somehow came down and- [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2186.62s)]
*  Looked great. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2190.38s)]
*  Still look good. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2191.38s)]
*  I think what happened with Aldo is he never really had a serious nutritionist where someone [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2192.38s)]
*  was like planning his meals, breaking it down by calories- [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2197.3s)]
*  He was just cutting all that weight for the 45. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2201.06s)]
*  And it's like, well, you could have been a lot smaller way before you even got to that [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2203.9399999999996s)]
*  weight cut. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2208.2599999999998s)]
*  Because I remember when he was at the top of the heap at 145, he was heavy, man. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2209.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he was struggling to make those weight cuts. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2213.8999999999996s)]
*  So when he said he was going down to Bantamweight, it's like, well, how are you going to go down [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2217.8599999999997s)]
*  to Bantamweight? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2221.2599999999998s)]
*  You used to struggle to make 145 pounds. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2222.2599999999998s)]
*  Lifestyle changes. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2226.02s)]
*  Yeah, lifestyle changes. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2227.02s)]
*  And some guys, that's the move. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2228.3799999999997s)]
*  And some guys, it just ruins them because they drain so much out of their body, they're [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2231.46s)]
*  not durable anymore. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2237.5s)]
*  I joked about, I've talked to Nick Sik and Brian Butler, my manager, and I'm like, maybe [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2239.06s)]
*  I'll come back on 145. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2244.9s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2247.9s)]
*  And I talked to Ian Larios, who does all my weight cuts. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2248.9s)]
*  He's like, are you out of your mind, dude? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2251.42s)]
*  Just because you're skinnier now doesn't mean you can drop a whole weight class and have [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2254.14s)]
*  no trouble making that weight. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2258.14s)]
*  Were you thinking about it at one point in time, doing one more fight? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2260.9s)]
*  Oh, man, I've thought about it many, many times. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2264.06s)]
*  Did you think about it after Olivero became the champ? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2267.14s)]
*  When you beat Olivero. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2270.98s)]
*  He was not, yeah. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2272.14s)]
*  You know, not really because we're on such different trajectories. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2274.1s)]
*  Just because at the time I had a win, which I loved having over him, I loved being the [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2279.46s)]
*  last guy that had beaten the champion, which is no longer the case. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2283.1800000000003s)]
*  For me to come back and think I'm going to even come close to getting that match up, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2288.3399999999997s)]
*  it's like, that's not going to happen. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2292.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm going to have to win and beat all these insane, hungry contenders before I even get [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2294.1s)]
*  to sniff at that belt. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2300.18s)]
*  He was an interesting case. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2302.22s)]
*  He still is an interesting case because he was a guy who was kind of known as a guy who [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2303.8999999999996s)]
*  fell apart. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2309.62s)]
*  A quitter a little bit. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2310.62s)]
*  Cubs Swanson knocked him out, a bunch of guys at D-Day. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2312.2999999999997s)]
*  Max Holloway had that weird neck thing going on. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2315.02s)]
*  What happened to Max Holloway? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2318.78s)]
*  Remember he had a weird stinger almost in his neck, I think. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2320.26s)]
*  And he kind of just crumbled in the corner and tapped out. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2325.5s)]
*  I think it was a legit thing with his neck. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2328.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, I remember that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2329.94s)]
*  It was kind of scary. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2331.94s)]
*  I forgot about that. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2332.94s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2333.94s)]
*  But then everybody was calling him a quitter. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2334.94s)]
*  And he just turned a corner and then became the baddest motherfucker in the weight class. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2337.22s)]
*  Not just the baddest motherfucker in the weight class, but one of the best motherfuckers in [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2341.7s)]
*  the sport. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2344.66s)]
*  When he knocked out Chandler and he beat the shit out of Gagey, when he was putting it [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2345.8599999999997s)]
*  on people, you got to go, God damn, he's good. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2351.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm curious to see if he comes back and gets back to that Islam fight because he seems [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2354.8999999999996s)]
*  to want it. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2362.2999999999997s)]
*  At first it didn't seem like, after you've been there with Islam, I think a lot of people [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2363.2999999999997s)]
*  go, I don't know if I want to get back in there right away. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2367.8999999999996s)]
*  He's on such another level. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2371.5s)]
*  And then you think about it for a while. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2372.5s)]
*  What's it say here? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2374.38s)]
*  Olivero Suffolto, a Michael Tarran is a suffogus. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2375.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2378.6600000000003s)]
*  And you know what that was probably due to? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2379.6600000000003s)]
*  He said he injured his neck in training but did physical therapy and thought everything [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2382.62s)]
*  was fine. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2386.1800000000003s)]
*  What do you think it's due to? [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2387.1800000000003s)]
*  Probably all of the weight cuts that he had been doing to make 145 pounds back in the [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2388.1800000000003s)]
*  day. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2392.86s)]
*  That's right, the 45. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2393.86s)]
*  Now he probably heard it in training legit, but when you're constantly dehydrating yourself [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2394.86s)]
*  camp after camp after camp. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2398.5s)]
*  And I remember when he fought me, he was still trying to go back down to 145 pounds, which [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2400.18s)]
*  is why he wasn't as big. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2405.5s)]
*  I must have been 20 pounds heavier than him when I fought him back then. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2408.14s)]
*  And so then he made a conscious decision. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2412.54s)]
*  He said, I'm going to stay here because they told him you have no choice. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2414.1s)]
*  So like you're either going to fight in this weight class or you're going to keep missing [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2418.4199999999996s)]
*  and screwing yourself over. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2422.06s)]
*  It's crazy because his power developed. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2423.58s)]
*  Like when he hit Gage, he said no one ever hit him that hard before. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2426.1s)]
*  He said he felt in his teeth. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2429.74s)]
*  Even back in the day when he was still Mr. Skinny Charles Olivera and he kicked me a [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2432.3399999999997s)]
*  few times. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2436.7799999999997s)]
*  I remember being like, God damn, I thought I was going to buzzsaw through this guy on [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2437.7799999999997s)]
*  the feet and he lands a few shots and you could see where that strength was there. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2441.9799999999996s)]
*  That again, another one of those just wiry guys where you kind of underestimate their [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2446.9799999999996s)]
*  power and then they hit you and you're like, Jesus Christ. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2451.3399999999997s)]
*  Long lean. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2454.18s)]
*  It's a great build for fighting. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2455.2799999999997s)]
*  You look at some of the great fighters of our time, like the long lean guys. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2456.7s)]
*  It's the best build in my opinion. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2460.54s)]
*  Because you have the reach advantage. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2462.9s)]
*  The reach, jujitsu, you can wrap everybody up. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2464.7s)]
*  You can sneak your arms in through. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2467.42s)]
*  You're not as bulky, which maybe you don't have as much of that brunt kind of power that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2470.22s)]
*  some of the guys that are shorter in stock here would have in the division. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2475.62s)]
*  But I think that long lean muscle for MMA is the way to be. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2478.3399999999997s)]
*  And I was just short and stumpy. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2484.2599999999998s)]
*  I had no reach. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2485.8599999999997s)]
*  None of those benefits, unfortunately. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2488.14s)]
*  Yeah, but then look at Mighty Mouse. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2490.4199999999996s)]
*  He's short and stumpy too and he's the greatest of all time. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2492.22s)]
*  If not the greatest, he's in the conversation. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2494.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't think there's one real greatest of all time. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2496.62s)]
*  Khabib is most certainly in the conversation. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2499.9399999999996s)]
*  John Jones. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2501.7s)]
*  John Jones for sure. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2502.7s)]
*  John Jones has got the perfect build. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2503.7s)]
*  Perfect build. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2506.2999999999997s)]
*  How is that going to translate to heavyweight? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2507.9399999999996s)]
*  It's very interesting because everybody else has the perfect build up there too. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2509.58s)]
*  It's a different world when you're dealing with natural 245s, natural 260s. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2512.7s)]
*  I was really looking forward to him and Francis. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2517.54s)]
*  I think everybody was, man. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2519.9399999999996s)]
*  I got real bummed out when they didn't make that happen. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2521.5s)]
*  I think Francis just sees that pot of gold at the end of the boxing rainbow and is like, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2524.66s)]
*  you know what? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2529.7s)]
*  I'm going to make some fucking money. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2530.7s)]
*  And my hope is, here's my hope. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2532.3399999999997s)]
*  Here's the perfect world. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2534.74s)]
*  The perfect world is he goes over, has some big money heavyweight boxing fight. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2535.74s)]
*  John Jones and Cyril Gaughan have a fight. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2541.54s)]
*  John wins, Cyril wins, whoever wins is the UFC champion. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2544.42s)]
*  And then they have... [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2549.2200000000003s)]
*  Comes back. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2550.2200000000003s)]
*  And then Francis comes back. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2551.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2552.2200000000003s)]
*  I'd like to see him come back. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2553.2200000000003s)]
*  He can totally come back. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2554.2200000000003s)]
*  Francis, if you're listening, sir, please don't sign an exclusive contract. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2555.2200000000003s)]
*  Just go make some money. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2559.1400000000003s)]
*  No, there's no way, right? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2560.1400000000003s)]
*  Who knows if someone comes along and offers them a shit ton of money? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2561.34s)]
*  Look, I mean, he should. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2564.3s)]
*  If someone says, hey, I'll give you $100 million. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2565.84s)]
*  Do whatever. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2567.62s)]
*  You do whatever. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2568.62s)]
*  You say, okay, what do I got to do? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2569.62s)]
*  Jake Paul? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2570.8599999999997s)]
*  What the fuck do I have to do? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2571.8599999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2572.8599999999997s)]
*  Like if they're going to offer him big money. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2573.8599999999997s)]
*  But I think they're trying to do a Tyson Fury fight. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2575.58s)]
*  I know Tyson Fury was saying a bunch of crazy shit like, we'll fight in a cage. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2578.46s)]
*  We'll get out of the fucking... [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2582.7s)]
*  We'll get out of the fucking four-dome clubs. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2583.7s)]
*  With boxing rules, MMA gloves. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2586.42s)]
*  Mike Tyson as the referee, he's saying. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2587.74s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2589.74s)]
*  Why? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2590.74s)]
*  Because I mean, that would be... [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2591.74s)]
*  More people would buy it. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2592.74s)]
*  I mean, that's just getting a bunch of people to buy it. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2593.74s)]
*  Make as much money as they humanly can. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2598.06s)]
*  I mean, Tyson... [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2601.06s)]
*  People need to understand the levels of boxing, though. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2602.86s)]
*  You got to understand... [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2607.5s)]
*  I mean, listen, Francis Ngannou could knock out any human being on earth if he can hit [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2608.5s)]
*  them clean on the chin. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2612.1400000000003s)]
*  But good luck hitting Tyson Fury clean on the chin. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2613.1800000000003s)]
*  Bro. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  Did you see Floyd Mayweather sparring yesterday? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2617.1800000000003s)]
*  I did. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2619.46s)]
*  He made that kid... [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2620.46s)]
*  I don't know who that kid is. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2621.54s)]
*  Well, the kid is like a decent boxer. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2623.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2624.9s)]
*  Decent boxer. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2625.9s)]
*  I mean, he was... [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2627.46s)]
*  I just saw it yesterday. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2628.62s)]
*  I was watching. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2629.9s)]
*  And he was just... [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2630.9s)]
*  And he was talking. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2631.9s)]
*  Playing with him. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2632.9s)]
*  Bang. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2633.9s)]
*  Bang. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2634.9s)]
*  Playing with him. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2635.9s)]
*  And moving away from him. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2636.9s)]
*  And the kid, whoever this guy is, I guess he's a YouTuber. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2637.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2640.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2641.1800000000003s)]
*  Do you know who he is, Jamie? [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2642.1800000000003s)]
*  The kid had an excellent account of himself. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2644.6600000000003s)]
*  Because even though Floyd was tagging him, he didn't shy away. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2647.42s)]
*  He kept moving forward. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2651.06s)]
*  He was just... [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2652.06s)]
*  And you can't get frustrated. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2653.06s)]
*  The worst thing you can do when Floyd's talking shit to you like that is rush him. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2654.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2658.8599999999997s)]
*  Because you're going to walk into a right hand and you're going to look like an idiot. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2659.8599999999997s)]
*  So he's... [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2664.94s)]
*  I mean, he's like 50 years old. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2665.94s)]
*  I mean, it's amazing. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2668.66s)]
*  His understanding of where the punches are coming... [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2670.22s)]
*  Look at that fucking counter. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2672.46s)]
*  His understanding of... [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2675.22s)]
*  Is that the dude he boxed? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2677.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2678.02s)]
*  He's talking about the video. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2679.02s)]
*  Oh, let's hear him say it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2680.02s)]
*  What he's saying. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2681.02s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2685.18s)]
*  I didn't even see that. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2686.18s)]
*  That was like... [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2688.18s)]
*  Big buddy Shubblerk is coming. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2689.18s)]
*  And he touched you with that. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2691.18s)]
*  Yeah, just touched him. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2694.18s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2695.18s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2696.18s)]
*  If he wanted to take you down with that liver shot, he would have taken you down. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2697.18s)]
*  Yeah, easily. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2701.18s)]
*  He's just tapping him up. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2702.18s)]
*  But that guy's got a great sense of humor about it. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2703.18s)]
*  It's very funny how he's laughing about it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2706.18s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, you got to think this guy is 50 years old. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2710.18s)]
*  I mean, how old is Floyd now? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2715.18s)]
*  He's got to be close to 50. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2716.18s)]
*  He's got to be late 40s. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2717.18s)]
*  48? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2718.18s)]
*  Late 40s. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2719.18s)]
*  And at this point in time... [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2720.18s)]
*  45. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2724.18s)]
*  45? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2725.18s)]
*  Sorry, Floyd. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2726.18s)]
*  Sorry, Floyd. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2727.18s)]
*  But I mean, past his prime and still just making millions of dollars fighting people [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2728.18s)]
*  that have no business. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2734.18s)]
*  He's really brilliant. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2735.18s)]
*  What he's doing is brilliant because he gets these guys to fight him. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2736.18s)]
*  They have no business fighting him. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2741.18s)]
*  He's making millions of dollars. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2742.18s)]
*  He puts on a show. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2744.18s)]
*  Do you see the one he did? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2745.18s)]
*  I guess it was in... [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2746.18s)]
*  Was it in Dubai? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2748.18s)]
*  Where he took the ring card and he was walking around in between rounds holding the ring card. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2750.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2755.18s)]
*  I didn't see that one. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2756.18s)]
*  He took it from the ring card girl. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2757.18s)]
*  He was just having a blast. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2758.18s)]
*  I saw the one a while back. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2759.18s)]
*  He fought that kickboxer kid. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2760.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2761.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2762.18s)]
*  That was like the first time he had done one of those. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2763.18s)]
*  Tension. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2764.18s)]
*  Yeah, one of those big exhibitions. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2765.18s)]
*  It's just like he's just kind of making it look so... [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2766.18s)]
*  But Tension fought 126. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2769.18s)]
*  Tension's a tiny guy. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2770.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2772.18s)]
*  He's a brilliant kickboxer. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2773.18s)]
*  But without kicking. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2774.18s)]
*  Yeah, without the kicking. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2775.18s)]
*  You've got no chance. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2776.18s)]
*  I know. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2777.18s)]
*  You might not even have a chance. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2778.18s)]
*  He has a chance of kicking. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2779.18s)]
*  Can you imagine if they let him leg kick Floyd? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2780.18s)]
*  That's the only way I'm getting in there. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2783.18s)]
*  Can I elbow? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2785.18s)]
*  How about this? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2786.18s)]
*  Can I knee you? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2787.18s)]
*  I get 10 leg kicks around. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2788.18s)]
*  Give me one. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2791.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2792.18s)]
*  Give me one. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2793.18s)]
*  Give me one. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2794.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2795.18s)]
*  If I land, I don't want to... [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2796.18s)]
*  Oh, you get those juices flowing again. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2798.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2800.18s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2801.18s)]
*  I do, man. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2802.18s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2803.18s)]
*  It's a... [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2804.18s)]
*  Especially since we do commentary, right? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2805.18s)]
*  So I'm around these elite fighters all the time, and I try to be respectful. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2808.18s)]
*  But you can tell if sometimes somebody will get sassy or have a comment about what I said. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2815.18s)]
*  And it's like, man, don't forget that I've been in there too, man. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2819.18s)]
*  I know everything that's going on there. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2823.18s)]
*  I've had my ass beat. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2825.18s)]
*  I've beaten some good dudes. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2826.18s)]
*  I've never was champion. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2828.18s)]
*  That's the only thing. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2830.18s)]
*  Sometimes I feel a little bit of... [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2831.18s)]
*  What's the word where you feel like you're... [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2833.18s)]
*  Imposter syndrome? [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2838.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2839.18s)]
*  Like I don't deserve to be there sometimes because you got Dom next to me. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2840.18s)]
*  He's champ. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2843.18s)]
*  WEC champ. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2844.18s)]
*  I got DC's double champ next to me. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2845.18s)]
*  Well, what about me? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2847.18s)]
*  I never even fought MMA. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2848.18s)]
*  Yeah, but you're there day one. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2849.18s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2850.18s)]
*  Yeah, but you do a great job. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2851.18s)]
*  You shouldn't have imposter syndrome. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2853.18s)]
*  And you are absolutely a legitimate, top flight professional fighter. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2855.18s)]
*  It's just that sport is always going to have sensitive people when you dedicate your entire life to this one moment. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2859.18s)]
*  And then someone's criticizing it and saying, oh, he could have done this and he could have done that. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2866.18s)]
*  And they're like, fuck you, Paul Felder. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2871.18s)]
*  I've had to take some Joe Rogan lessons on not reading the comments and not doing all that stuff. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2873.18s)]
*  Everyone should listen to me about that. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2880.18s)]
*  For the longest time, I would get into these arguments and you can't win because you've already lost. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2882.18s)]
*  The second you type it in and send it, they just won. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2889.18s)]
*  Yeah, you lost right away. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2894.18s)]
*  You lost really letting it get to you is the first loss. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2896.18s)]
*  There's nothing at stake, so you can't win anything. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2900.18s)]
*  No. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2903.18s)]
*  There's no way to win. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2904.18s)]
*  I'll beat you up, internet guy. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2905.18s)]
*  I say that, but then there's Gordon Ryan who loves to fucking go back and forth with people online. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2907.18s)]
*  But does he have fun doing it? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2912.18s)]
*  He does. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2914.18s)]
*  He's a legitimate psycho though. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2915.18s)]
*  But as long as you can enjoy it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2918.18s)]
*  He's a real psycho. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2920.18s)]
*  As long as you can enjoy it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2921.18s)]
*  I started to get mad. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2923.18s)]
*  He enjoys it. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2925.18s)]
*  He gets a kick out of it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2926.18s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2927.18s)]
*  You can't hurt his feelings like that. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2928.18s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2930.18s)]
*  First of all, where's the trash talk even coming from with a guy like that? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2932.18s)]
*  What are you saying though? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2936.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2937.18s)]
*  That he's not the best? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2938.18s)]
*  Oh, you only won 50 in a row. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2939.18s)]
*  You can't heel hook everybody? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2940.18s)]
*  Oh, fucking rooty shit. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2942.18s)]
*  You're the greatest of all time. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2943.18s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2945.18s)]
*  You suck, bro. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2946.18s)]
*  You're a beautiful, handsome, tall, good looking guy built like a Greek god. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2947.18s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2950.18s)]
*  Abs. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2951.18s)]
*  Hate your abs. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2952.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2953.18s)]
*  Probably see you can want to suck dick. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2954.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting thing that social media, because I've seen it ruin people's lives. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2957.18s)]
*  I've seen some fighters, they get into it with people on social media and they're going [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2963.18s)]
*  back and forth all the time. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2967.18s)]
*  And I know that's fucking with their head. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2968.18s)]
*  I know they're probably thinking about that when they're hitting pads or thinking about [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2970.18s)]
*  some mean thing that someone said to them. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2973.18s)]
*  Or someone posts a get. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2975.18s)]
*  I remember people used to fuck with Rashad Evans. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2977.18s)]
*  There was that photo of him when Leota Machida knocked him out and it was like his eyeballs [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2980.18s)]
*  were rolled back in his head. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2984.18s)]
*  And some guy came up to him at one of them arcs. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2986.18s)]
*  To sign it? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2990.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2991.18s)]
*  And he crumpled it up and threw it at him. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2992.18s)]
*  Should have just signed it. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2994.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2996.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2997.18s)]
*  You're standing right next to a lion. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=2998.18s)]
*  How about you watch your fucking mouth? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3002.18s)]
*  You think you're cute? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3005.18s)]
*  Go up to Rashad Evans and put a picture of him being knocked out? [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3006.18s)]
*  Yeah, you think that's cute? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3010.18s)]
*  He'll rip your fucking head off your body. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3011.18s)]
*  How about that? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3013.18s)]
*  He's a much calmer man these days, man. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3014.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3016.18s)]
*  He went on a psychedelic journey. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3017.18s)]
*  He became a different human. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3019.18s)]
*  It's so funny to see him. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3021.18s)]
*  Just his energy in the backstage area is just so calm now. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3023.18s)]
*  I remember hanging out with you. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3028.18s)]
*  That's what it doesn't. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3030.18s)]
*  You turn into a fucking giraffe. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3031.18s)]
*  That's the one thing I can't. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3033.18s)]
*  John Gooden too. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3036.18s)]
*  I just can't get on that bandwagon. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3037.18s)]
*  I don't think it's good for you. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3041.18s)]
*  It might be okay for some people, but I don't believe it's the optimum diet. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3043.18s)]
*  This comes from many, many, many conversations with nutritionists and vegans too, [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3047.18s)]
*  and trying to listen to people that are vegan. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3052.18s)]
*  You can do it and pull it off, but you have to really be careful, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3054.18s)]
*  and you have to really mind your macronutrients and really pay attention to what you're taking in. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3058.18s)]
*  Yeah, because it just seems so easy to take way too much of processed shit. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3061.18s)]
*  It's not just that. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3068.18s)]
*  You definitely could do that, but it's also your body is not absorbing. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3069.18s)]
*  When people go, you can't go one-to-one with animal products versus broccoli. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3073.18s)]
*  If you say, oh, I've got 25 grams of protein from broccoli, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3078.18s)]
*  no, you didn't, because your body's not absorbing it the same. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3082.18s)]
*  With all that fiber, you're just going to be farting the whole time. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3085.18s)]
*  You're definitely going to be farting the whole time. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3088.18s)]
*  Some people have done it right. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3090.18s)]
*  They can do it. It can be done right. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3092.18s)]
*  I just don't think it's the optimal diet. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3094.18s)]
*  I really believe that red meat, and this is very controversial, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3096.18s)]
*  but it's backed up by science. It really is. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3100.18s)]
*  Red meat is one of the most nutrient-dense foods. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3103.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3105.18s)]
*  All of our ideas about what's bad and what's good, we've been hoodwinked. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3106.18s)]
*  We've been hoodwinked by a bunch of fucked up studies that were conducted by the sugar companies [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3110.18s)]
*  because they paid scientists off to lie about the dangers of saturated fat, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3117.18s)]
*  and that is just in everyone's consciousness. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3121.18s)]
*  Then there's all these people, what about your cholesterol? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3123.18s)]
*  What about that? What about this? What about that? [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3126.18s)]
*  I get my blood work done all the time. I'm healthy as fuck. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3129.18s)]
*  Yeah. So you know, and you are eating a lot of red meat. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3132.18s)]
*  I'm eating mostly meat. All of January, I go on the carnivore diet. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3135.18s)]
*  I do it every year. All January, I eat nothing but meat. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3139.18s)]
*  I feel fucked and great. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3142.18s)]
*  You don't crave like ... I guess you do, yeah. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3144.18s)]
*  I do cheat. I cheat a couple times. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3146.18s)]
*  What's your go-to? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3148.18s)]
*  Sushi. I had some sushi. That was really good. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3149.18s)]
*  But it's just rice. I cheated with rice. I cheated a little bit. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3152.18s)]
*  Rice is my favorite thing on the planet. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3155.18s)]
*  I had dessert three times this month. Yeah. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3157.18s)]
*  And I had a piece of bread yesterday. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3160.18s)]
*  Fuck yeah. I love bread, dude. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3163.18s)]
*  I did too. I love it. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3166.18s)]
*  I had a steak and I was like, one piece of bread's not going to fucking kill me. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3168.18s)]
*  You know what I want after the steak? Some bread. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3171.18s)]
*  Yes. After the steak? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3174.18s)]
*  No, I'm just saying. I always want bread now. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3175.18s)]
*  I love bread. Bread with butter. It's fucking goddamn, it's so good. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3178.18s)]
*  You know what? Warm bread. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3182.18s)]
*  Have you ever heard of this? When I was a kid, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3183.18s)]
*  if we had anything with gravy for dinner, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3186.18s)]
*  we would do bread and gravy afterwards. Oh yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3190.18s)]
*  My dad would go to the kitchen, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3193.18s)]
*  grab the biggest thing of white bread that we had, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3195.18s)]
*  put a pile on it. Anybody want some bread and gravy? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3198.18s)]
*  Just sop it up. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3200.18s)]
*  And we would just sit there, grab the gravy, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3201.18s)]
*  pour it all over bread. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3204.18s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm Italian and my grandparents used to live [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3206.18s)]
*  in this very Italian neighborhood in New Jersey [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3210.18s)]
*  that eventually wasn't Italian, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3213.18s)]
*  but they had these Italian bakeries. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3215.18s)]
*  And I'd go walk with my grandfather to this bakery. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3217.18s)]
*  He'd go to the bakery every couple of days [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3220.18s)]
*  and buy a couple of loaves of bread. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3222.18s)]
*  And it was the freshest bread. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3224.18s)]
*  And you'd carve into it, and my grandmother would make [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3226.18s)]
*  homemade pasta sauce. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3229.18s)]
*  And oh my God, the marinara. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3232.18s)]
*  That's my favorite thing in the world. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3234.18s)]
*  Dip it in there with butter. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3235.18s)]
*  While it's still bubbling away, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3237.18s)]
*  you have a side of bread, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3239.18s)]
*  slather that with some butter, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3241.18s)]
*  and right into the pot. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3243.18s)]
*  Almost scold your whole face off, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3244.18s)]
*  but it's just whatever. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3246.18s)]
*  I'm going in. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3248.18s)]
*  So good. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3249.18s)]
*  I mean, I know it's terrible for you, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3250.18s)]
*  but like, look, you're from Philly. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3251.18s)]
*  A fucking cheesesteak sub. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3253.18s)]
*  A real good one. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3256.18s)]
*  A real good one with just fucking hot, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3258.18s)]
*  and you're ripping apart at the middle [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3262.18s)]
*  and take a bite into it, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3264.18s)]
*  and just the crunch of the bread on the outside [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3265.18s)]
*  and the juicy net. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3268.18s)]
*  It's the bread, man. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3270.18s)]
*  Even all the hoagies and stuff like that, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3271.18s)]
*  you get the hard seeded rolls. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3273.18s)]
*  That's the way to go. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3275.18s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3276.18s)]
*  Jesus, look at that. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3278.18s)]
*  Eat that, Belal. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3279.18s)]
*  Philly doesn't suck. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3281.18s)]
*  Chicago sucks. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3282.18s)]
*  Go, birds. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3284.18s)]
*  Look how good that looks. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3285.18s)]
*  God, that looks good. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3287.18s)]
*  That's whiz wit right there. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3288.18s)]
*  That's whiz wit. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3290.18s)]
*  It's funny how Philly became known for cheesesteaks. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3291.18s)]
*  That is the food of Philadelphia. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3295.18s)]
*  If you ask someone, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3298.18s)]
*  I don't think there's another place like that [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3300.18s)]
*  in terms of a sandwich [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3303.18s)]
*  that's completely connected to one city. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3306.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3309.18s)]
*  Name another place. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3310.18s)]
*  No. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3311.18s)]
*  I can't. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3312.18s)]
*  I guess... [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3313.18s)]
*  Chicago's got the... [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3314.18s)]
*  Deep dish. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3316.18s)]
*  And what's their sandwich? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3317.18s)]
*  They do a beef sandwich too in Chicago. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3319.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3322.18s)]
*  But it's not as famous as a cheesesteak. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3323.18s)]
*  Philly's synonymous with cheesesteaks. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3326.18s)]
*  And Jim's, which was always my favorite spot on South Street, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3329.18s)]
*  that just burned down not too long ago. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3332.18s)]
*  I don't even think it's back up and running. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3334.18s)]
*  And then obviously Pat's and Gino's are just the... [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3337.18s)]
*  They're kind of touristy, right? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3339.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3341.18s)]
*  They're still good. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3342.18s)]
*  Bro, if it's 3 in the morning [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3343.18s)]
*  and you've been out, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3345.18s)]
*  and then you go and get a... [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3347.18s)]
*  It's going to taste amazing. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3348.18s)]
*  And you want to see a brawl. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3349.18s)]
*  If you want to see a fistfight. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3351.18s)]
*  You're five out of ten. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3352.18s)]
*  Or be in one. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3354.18s)]
*  You can go stand in that line. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3355.18s)]
*  What's the best cheesesteak in Philly? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3357.18s)]
*  There's got to be one best place. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3360.18s)]
*  I always went to Jim's, but everybody would argue... [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3362.18s)]
*  There's a spot in the Northeast, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3366.18s)]
*  I know the Dawkus brothers would be arguing with me about that, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3369.18s)]
*  and Sean Brady. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3372.18s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3374.18s)]
*  I don't even... [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3375.18s)]
*  I don't eat them that often, to be honest with you. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3376.18s)]
*  When you grow up... [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3379.18s)]
*  Once a year? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3381.18s)]
*  No. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3382.18s)]
*  No. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3383.18s)]
*  More than that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3384.18s)]
*  When I say I don't eat them very often, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3385.18s)]
*  I mean every couple months I'll have a cheesesteak. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3387.18s)]
*  But I'm a pizza guy nowadays. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3389.18s)]
*  Every time I watch Dave Portnoy test pizza, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3392.18s)]
*  I wish I was there with him. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3395.18s)]
*  I get so jealous. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3396.18s)]
*  Like when he's just taking a bite... [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3398.18s)]
*  Meanwhile you're eating a steak, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3400.18s)]
*  and he's just crushing bread. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3402.18s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's not good for you. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3403.18s)]
*  The right way for me, just me personally, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3406.18s)]
*  when I eat and I feel my best is like fruit and meat. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3409.18s)]
*  That's it. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3412.18s)]
*  And I can eat greens. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3413.18s)]
*  Greens don't seem to bother me. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3414.18s)]
*  But the balance for me seems to be fruit and meat. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3416.18s)]
*  What is this? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3421.18s)]
*  Is this Jim's? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3422.18s)]
*  This is Jim's. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3423.18s)]
*  This is Jim's? [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3424.18s)]
*  Oh, that looks good. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3425.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3426.18s)]
*  I got to make a cheesesteak at Jim's for the UFC. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3427.18s)]
*  They did a feature when we... [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3430.18s)]
*  The last time they were in Philly, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3433.18s)]
*  me and my brother, me and my brother Tommy did a... [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3435.18s)]
*  These guys are going off. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3438.18s)]
*  Yeah, Barack. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3439.18s)]
*  Oh, mama. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3440.18s)]
*  Oh, I mean everybody's... [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3441.18s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the thing. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3443.18s)]
*  The thing I like about Jim's too on South Street [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3444.18s)]
*  is you can get beers and stuff there. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3446.18s)]
*  A lot of them you can't get. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3448.18s)]
*  They don't want you to get beer [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3450.18s)]
*  because it's three in the morning and you're going to... [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3451.18s)]
*  Chaos. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3453.18s)]
*  You're already trying to fight somebody outside of that place. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3454.18s)]
*  It's just funny that how did that happen [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3457.18s)]
*  where that became the known sandwich of Philadelphia? [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3459.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3463.18s)]
*  I think that... [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3464.18s)]
*  I remember I'd heard how they even got started. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3465.18s)]
*  I think a guy had some leftover steak [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3468.18s)]
*  and it was early in the morning or something [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3471.18s)]
*  and he threw a sandwich together [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3474.18s)]
*  and I think that's how they got started making them like that. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3475.18s)]
*  But I don't know how that became so damn famous with our city [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3478.18s)]
*  that we're known for cheese whizz and chop steak. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3482.18s)]
*  Yeah, when you think about all the different food, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3485.18s)]
*  all the different stuff that people could eat, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3486.18s)]
*  that one sandwich becomes famous for the same reason. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3488.18s)]
*  We were one of the founding, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3490.18s)]
*  the original capital of this nation. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3492.18s)]
*  What are we known for now? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3495.18s)]
*  Cheesesteaks. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3496.18s)]
*  Cheese whizz on... [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3497.18s)]
*  Well, also known for fights, fighters. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3498.18s)]
*  I mean, think about how many... [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3500.18s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins, Joe Frazier. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3501.18s)]
*  I mean, so many great fighters came out of Philadelphia. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3505.18s)]
*  Dude, there's a kid now. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3507.18s)]
*  Rocky. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3508.18s)]
*  Ennis. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3509.18s)]
*  Oh, Boots Ennis. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3510.18s)]
*  Whoo! [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3511.18s)]
*  Damn, bro. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3512.18s)]
*  God damn, he's good. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3513.18s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3514.18s)]
*  I remember training with him when he was like a teenager [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3515.18s)]
*  and he was just playing around with us [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3521.18s)]
*  and he would just move around. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3525.18s)]
*  I mean, we were grown adult MMA fighters, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3527.18s)]
*  couldn't even touch this kid, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3530.18s)]
*  and now look, he's just murdering people. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3532.18s)]
*  He's so slick. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3534.18s)]
*  The way he... [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3535.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3536.18s)]
*  Just like slides. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3537.18s)]
*  He basically does like a cartwheel [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3538.18s)]
*  and gets out of the way of some of these shots, man. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3540.18s)]
*  He's so slick. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3542.18s)]
*  He's so slick and creative and so entertaining to watch. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3543.18s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3546.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's so good at switching stances [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3547.18s)]
*  and his footwork and movement. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3550.18s)]
*  I'm so glad to see him doing as well as you [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3552.18s)]
*  because he was literally helping MMA guys out [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3554.18s)]
*  with his dad, obviously, Bozy, who's just training him. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3556.18s)]
*  I don't know if... [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3561.18s)]
*  I think that's who he's training with [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3562.18s)]
*  pretty much full-time still is his dad. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3564.18s)]
*  His dad still gets after it. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3565.18s)]
*  Bro. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3567.18s)]
*  His dad is 67 years old. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3568.18s)]
*  He will throw down if need be. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3569.18s)]
*  I've seen him box young kids in the gym [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3571.18s)]
*  who start mouthing off and he's like, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3574.18s)]
*  all right, you want to throw down? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3576.18s)]
*  Doesn't throw a headgear on it and he'll bust people up. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3577.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3580.18s)]
*  He's the man. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3581.18s)]
*  He cornered me for that, the spinning hook kick fight. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3582.18s)]
*  He was in my corner. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3585.18s)]
*  Really? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3586.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3587.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3588.18s)]
*  So when you were doing that, did you have an MMA gym [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3589.18s)]
*  or were you cross-training on your own, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3592.18s)]
*  like going to a boxing gym, a Muay Thai gym, a Jiu Jitsu gym? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3595.18s)]
*  So back then, we, at Daniel Gracie's gym in North Philly, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3598.18s)]
*  we had...if you went into our basement gym, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3603.18s)]
*  there was a sliding old-school door [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3608.18s)]
*  that went into another basement, and it was just like old warehouses [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3611.18s)]
*  that were turned into studios like this or a boxing gym. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3615.18s)]
*  And next door to us was a boxing gym. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3619.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3622.18s)]
*  So we started sharing the space. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3623.18s)]
*  So we would work with Bozy and all those guys and his sons and his... [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3624.18s)]
*  who are...he's got other sons who didn't make it the way Boots is now, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3629.18s)]
*  but they would spar with us, help us out, hold pads for us. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3633.18s)]
*  So that was kind of just like a little collab that we had going at the time. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3637.18s)]
*  Wow, that's fortunate. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3640.18s)]
*  It was great. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3642.18s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3643.18s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3644.18s)]
*  And they would...I remember some of the pro boxers there would just jab. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3645.18s)]
*  Like you'd be trying to beat their asses, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3648.18s)]
*  and you'd find out after the session that, yeah, I was just throwing jabs. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3651.18s)]
*  Like, look, think back. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3655.18s)]
*  He's like, did I ever hit you with the right hand? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3656.18s)]
*  It's like, no, you were only jabbing me in the face. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3658.18s)]
*  And I was trying to take your head off for, you know, six rounds or whatever it was. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3661.18s)]
*  And they were just sharpening up tools on you? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3665.18s)]
*  They were just working on one thing. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3667.18s)]
*  Or maybe just defense, not even punching. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3669.18s)]
*  Well, that would be a thing that Hicks and Gracie would always do with people. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3671.18s)]
*  You know, like he would just go for left arm bars. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3674.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3677.18s)]
*  So he would train with everybody and just like... [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3678.18s)]
*  That's the best way to do it. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3680.18s)]
*  If you're significantly better than somebody, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3681.18s)]
*  okay, well, how can I handicap myself so that I'm still working while you're still working? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3683.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3687.18s)]
*  It's just a good way to train. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3688.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard for a guy who's that much better than everybody else [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3690.18s)]
*  to get real good, solid work in. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3694.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3696.18s)]
*  And just don't put nobody on that level. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3697.18s)]
*  So what was the first... [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3699.18s)]
*  Was Dukes the first actual MMA gym? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3701.18s)]
*  I know you did some training with Cowboy too, right? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3704.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3706.18s)]
*  So way back when I was still an amateur, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3707.18s)]
*  he had like the tap out house back then where he had bunk beds in his own house [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3712.18s)]
*  and he would rent it out and you could just come [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3718.18s)]
*  and experience training with Donald and Leonard Garcia at the time. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3720.18s)]
*  So I flew out after sparring with him at a seminar and he's like, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3724.18s)]
*  you know what? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3729.18s)]
*  You don't even have to pay. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3730.18s)]
*  Just come out and you can train with us. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3731.18s)]
*  You can live in the house and be a sparring partner. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3732.18s)]
*  And then after experiencing that mess of living in bunk beds [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3734.18s)]
*  with these other fighter dudes sharing one bathroom, bro, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3739.18s)]
*  in the back of his house, because the way they had the ranch set up [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3742.18s)]
*  is Leonard had like this middle area, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3745.18s)]
*  Cowboy had his own bedroom with a bathroom in the back, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3747.18s)]
*  and then all of us dudes were just in like four bunk beds. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3750.18s)]
*  How many guys were in the house together? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3754.18s)]
*  Man, we'd have, there'd be like 10 guys at a time. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3755.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3758.18s)]
*  All taking dumps in the same bathroom. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3759.18s)]
*  Who was cooking? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3761.18s)]
*  Us, for ourselves, going to Walmart and buying shit. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3763.18s)]
*  And that's when you realize how back-assed some of these kids are with their diets. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3768.18s)]
*  It's like, what are you eating? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3773.18s)]
*  There's Oreos everywhere. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3774.18s)]
*  It's like little kids. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3776.18s)]
*  It's like you realize that none of us knew how to even live on our own. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3777.18s)]
*  And we all started, you started eating cleaner. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3781.18s)]
*  You started, well, the ones that wanted to be successful would. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3783.18s)]
*  And some of these kids would miss weight or they'd be partying and not training. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3786.18s)]
*  And it's like, dude, you're not here on vacation, man. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3792.18s)]
*  You're here to train. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3795.18s)]
*  And some guy being there with Cowboy, get his nose broken. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3797.18s)]
*  He used to spar four ounce gloves, no shin guards, no head gear, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3801.18s)]
*  just mouthpiece, MMA gloves in his cage at the ranch. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3806.18s)]
*  And I remember I was always getting thrown in because he'd wreck somebody. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3810.18s)]
*  All right, Felder, Philly, he called me back then. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3815.18s)]
*  Get Philly in here. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3818.18s)]
*  And I'd come in and take my ass beating. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3819.18s)]
*  But I kept coming after him. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3821.18s)]
*  I kept coming after him, coming after him. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3822.18s)]
*  And he started flying me out. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3824.18s)]
*  Then I started training with those guys. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3826.18s)]
*  And then obviously I got my UFC debut. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3827.18s)]
*  And he definitely, he's like, get your ass out here. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3829.18s)]
*  I went out there. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3832.18s)]
*  I brought my buddy John with me. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3833.18s)]
*  And I did that for a while. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3835.18s)]
*  And then I was like, OK. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3838.18s)]
*  It was too much. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3841.18s)]
*  And it was Cowboy. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3843.18s)]
*  It was the Cowboy show. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3845.18s)]
*  I needed to find somewhere where I could kind of have my own little bit of a training camp. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3846.18s)]
*  I could still go and train with him, but I wasn't going to get that attention that I needed. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3852.18s)]
*  And now being in the UFC, that's when I was finally like, man, I can't just be a sparring partner anymore. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3857.18s)]
*  And that's when I started doing my own training camps. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3863.18s)]
*  And I floated around Daniel Gracie. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3866.18s)]
*  I worked with Nick Catone and Ricardo and Mark Henry and those guys for a couple fights. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3869.18s)]
*  And it just, it didn't, nothing against those guys. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3875.18s)]
*  I love all those guys. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3877.18s)]
*  But it didn't seem like it just didn't fit my style. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3880.18s)]
*  And then my manager at the time, Brian, was like, I want you to go check out Duke and see which. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3883.18s)]
*  So I flew out there when I was getting ready for Gilbert Burns, which ended up not happening. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3888.18s)]
*  He broke his arm in that fight. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3894.18s)]
*  But that's the first time I flew out there. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3896.18s)]
*  I'd lost to Trinaldo in Brazil. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3898.18s)]
*  And then I flew out to Duke's and I never left. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3900.18s)]
*  I stayed there for the entire training camp. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3902.18s)]
*  Once I met him, once I hit pads with him one time, I was like, that's my guy. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3905.18s)]
*  Really? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3909.18s)]
*  That's my guy. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3910.18s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3911.18s)]
*  He's like a he's like Rain Man of Thai pads and Thai knowledge. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3912.18s)]
*  He's so damn good. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3916.18s)]
*  He's a well-known Thai. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3918.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3920.18s)]
*  He'll tell you all about it too. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3921.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3923.18s)]
*  You want to hear about it? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3924.18s)]
*  Duke will friggin talk to you about it. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3926.18s)]
*  I love that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3927.18s)]
*  You got to think of him and his brother. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3928.18s)]
*  I mean, they were at the forefront of kickboxing. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3929.18s)]
*  You know, when his brother, I forget who that Thai guy, whose brother fought, but when his brother was the king of kings in kickboxing, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3932.18s)]
*  then he fought that Thai guy and that Thai guy chopped his legs apart. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3940.18s)]
*  And then Duke, who was 19 at the time, was like, well, I don't think there's any talent in kicking legs. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3943.18s)]
*  And then he's like, I'm never going to let that happen. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3948.18s)]
*  That was the moment when he was like, oh, yeah, I guess there is something to this stuff. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3950.18s)]
*  And then he became obsessed with it. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3955.18s)]
*  I remember the first time I found out about Muay Thai. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3957.18s)]
*  I was training in Boston and I was training with this. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3959.18s)]
*  I was I was running this Thai Kwon Do school and I was working with this boxing trainer. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3963.18s)]
*  And this boxing trainer had this other guy who ran a karate school in Everett, Rich Vasapoli. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3969.18s)]
*  Great fucking guy. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3977.18s)]
*  He died actually doing a triathlon. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3978.18s)]
*  He got kicked. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3980.18s)]
*  He got kicked in the head while he was swimming and he got knocked out, I guess. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3982.18s)]
*  Yes, this is the fight. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3987.18s)]
*  So he just doesn't even know what to do. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3989.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3991.18s)]
*  And well, also, Rick had him hurt. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3992.18s)]
*  He had him hurt and dropped him. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3994.18s)]
*  He could punch, man. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3996.18s)]
*  Rick. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3997.18s)]
*  He could punch. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3998.18s)]
*  He could do everything. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=3999.18s)]
*  Rick could do everything. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4000.18s)]
*  And he was so clever, like his kicking and everything was so slick. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4001.18s)]
*  But this motherfucker was just chopping him down. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4005.18s)]
*  Just marching forward. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4008.18s)]
*  Just chopping him down. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4009.18s)]
*  And he just brutalized his legs. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4010.18s)]
*  And Rick didn't react to it at all. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4012.18s)]
*  He didn't know what to do. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4014.18s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4015.18s)]
*  He hurt him. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4016.18s)]
*  He hurt him bad. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4017.18s)]
*  What did he say? [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4019.18s)]
*  Was it a high kick? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4021.18s)]
*  He kicked into the left hand. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4023.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4025.18s)]
*  So he kicked him and then through left hand. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4026.18s)]
*  Boom. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4029.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4030.18s)]
*  Like almost like a Superman punch. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4031.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4032.18s)]
*  With one leg up. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4033.18s)]
*  Caught him on the chin. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4034.18s)]
*  That's blood or his mouth guard? [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4035.18s)]
*  Mouth guard. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4036.18s)]
*  All right. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4037.18s)]
*  So he puts his mouth guard back in. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4038.18s)]
*  I mean, round one. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4040.18s)]
*  That's round one. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4041.18s)]
*  Round one. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4042.18s)]
*  I mean, very, very interesting moment in striking because... [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4043.18s)]
*  Oh. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4049.18s)]
*  Oh, look. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4050.18s)]
*  You hurt him again. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4051.18s)]
*  He tags him, drops him a second time in the round. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4052.18s)]
*  Like he had him in real fucking trouble. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4054.18s)]
*  And this dude gets up and Rick had some fucking hands. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4056.18s)]
*  I mean, he had amazing kicks above the waist and eventually developed great kicks below the waist. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4059.18s)]
*  But this Thai guy just kept fucking chopping the legs. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4065.18s)]
*  And I think this fight was a fight... [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4069.18s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4073.18s)]
*  Changpwik Kitsongrit. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4074.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4078.18s)]
*  You need Duke to pronounce that one. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4079.18s)]
*  Or Mark Delgrate could probably do it. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4080.18s)]
*  So he had this dude in all kinds of trouble. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4082.18s)]
*  Mark definitely could. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4084.18s)]
*  Well, Mark can actually speak Thai. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4085.18s)]
*  It's wild watching him speak Thai because he's fucking Boston accent, fucking Italian guy. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4087.18s)]
*  And he's speaking Thai. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4093.18s)]
*  Oh. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4095.18s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4096.18s)]
*  Jump spinning back kick to the head at the end of the first round. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4097.18s)]
*  So this dude is getting his ass handed to him in the first round and then comes back in the second and just starts fucking marching him down and chopping those legs. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4100.18s)]
*  He can go right there. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4111.18s)]
*  Just go right there. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4112.18s)]
*  You can get a sense of it. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4113.18s)]
*  But we got a sense of like, oh, this is crazy. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4115.18s)]
*  Like he's taking away his ability to move and he's taking away his ability. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4119.18s)]
*  I mean, he's just thumping those shins. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4123.18s)]
*  You can see it right there. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4126.18s)]
*  That one right there. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4127.18s)]
*  He's already not moving it. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4128.18s)]
*  Not liking it. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4129.18s)]
*  Yeah, not liking it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4130.18s)]
*  And it opened up a lot of people's eyes. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4133.18s)]
*  And I want to say, shit, what year was this? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4135.18s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4137.18s)]
*  I mean, does it say? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4139.18s)]
*  88. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4142.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4143.18s)]
*  So no one even fucking understood Muay Thai outside of Thailand back then. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4144.18s)]
*  I mean, there was a few guys, but most people did not know what Muay Thai was about. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4148.18s)]
*  So this is when I first found out about Muay Thai. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4154.18s)]
*  And I had heard about this fight because I was a giant fan of Rick Rufus. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4158.18s)]
*  And this was on PKA Karate. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4162.18s)]
*  It was on ESPN. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4163.18s)]
*  And I started training and I started training with guys who were going over to Thailand and fighting. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4165.18s)]
*  There was this one dude that I knew who went over there for months and months at a time. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4172.18s)]
*  And this is in 88, 88 or 89. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4178.18s)]
*  This guy was going over to Thailand and training and coming back with all these stories. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4183.18s)]
*  Fucking cuts all over his forehead from elbows. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4189.18s)]
*  Yeah, getting meld. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4192.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4193.18s)]
*  But it was very eye opening. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4194.18s)]
*  The elbows were very eye opening because I hadn't really thought about that as an in-tight weapon that would work alongside with boxing. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4197.18s)]
*  And then the leg kicks. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4208.18s)]
*  And I remember being stunned at how effective leg kicks are. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4210.18s)]
*  It's so amazing. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4214.18s)]
*  Like watching that fight, it's like, wow. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4216.18s)]
*  And I remember being a little kid and I obviously grew up doing martial arts. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4218.18s)]
*  I remember a couple people, even when I was just starting doing Taekwondo and karate, people being like, you should do Muay Thai. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4222.18s)]
*  But even then I remember, you know, as a kid, I was born in 84. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4228.18s)]
*  So I was four when Rick was getting his ass handed leg kicks like that. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4232.18s)]
*  But even when I was a kid, people were like, no, you should do Muay Thai. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4238.18s)]
*  It was like dangerous. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4242.18s)]
*  I was 21. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4243.18s)]
*  So old. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4245.18s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4247.18s)]
*  It's wild thinking back to those days because I was at a time where martial arts had started to kind of like that was the first time striking styles merged where you saw like the above the waist kickboxing, which is what most of the people did in America. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4248.18s)]
*  And versus Muay Thai. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4266.18s)]
*  Muay Thai was so much more effective. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4268.18s)]
*  But if you had those above the waist style kicks and you can kick the legs. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4269.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4274.18s)]
*  But no one knew what to do with front leg side kicks. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4275.18s)]
*  I remember that when I was kickboxing was like no one know what to do with that. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4277.18s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4280.18s)]
*  You would stand sideways and they didn't know how to handle that. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4281.18s)]
*  You can't get in. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4283.18s)]
*  If you were really good at it. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4284.18s)]
*  There was this guy, Larry Jones, that I used to train with. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4285.18s)]
*  Larry was six foot two and he was all legs. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4287.18s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4290.18s)]
*  His legs went up to here. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4291.18s)]
*  I never saw anybody felt like him. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4292.18s)]
*  He had the torso of a five foot man and he had these legs that were incredible, incredible dexterity. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4293.18s)]
*  And he would side kick the fuck out of everybody. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4300.18s)]
*  And you just couldn't get close to him. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4303.18s)]
*  You try to move forward. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4305.18s)]
*  You could have the best hands in the world. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4306.18s)]
*  Like a lot of those point fighter guys. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4308.18s)]
*  Like there's a guy named Mafia Holloway. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4311.18s)]
*  Do you know who he is? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4313.18s)]
*  He was a guy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4314.18s)]
*  He was the first guy. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4315.18s)]
*  I fought a couple of those point tournaments just for fuck around. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4316.18s)]
*  I wasn't a point fighting guy, but I would do it every now and then. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4319.18s)]
*  And I fought him in a point fighting tournament. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4321.18s)]
*  I remember being so baffled like what to do because I was used to continuous. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4324.18s)]
*  The Tiger No fights were continuous. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4329.18s)]
*  He would just swap, tap me. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4331.18s)]
*  And I was like, oh wow. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4333.18s)]
*  I was like, this is something I need to learn how to do. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4334.18s)]
*  And I remember thinking that when MMA started emerging, I was like, that is an unseen skill. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4336.18s)]
*  The ability to point fight. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4343.18s)]
*  And then Venom Page came and showed everybody. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4344.18s)]
*  Venom Page was the first guy that was like a really good point fighter that made his way into MMA. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4346.18s)]
*  I'm like, there's... [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4352.18s)]
*  Wonder Boy as well. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4353.18s)]
*  Wonder Boy as well. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4354.18s)]
*  But Wonder Boy was a kickboxer. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4355.18s)]
*  Wonder Boy did a lot of above the waist kickboxing. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4356.18s)]
*  He was fucking phenomenal at that. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4358.18s)]
*  His record is crazy. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4360.18s)]
*  57-0 or something crazy like that. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4361.18s)]
*  I mean, Wonder Boy is like... [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4364.18s)]
*  That fight with Kevin Holland, that let everybody know. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4366.18s)]
*  You just want to stand up with Wonder Boy. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4369.18s)]
*  You're in trouble. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4371.18s)]
*  No threat of the takedown at all. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4372.18s)]
*  Wonder Boy is a bad man. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4374.18s)]
*  He's a bad man. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4376.18s)]
*  He's just going to have fun. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4378.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4380.18s)]
*  Even if you hurt him, it's like, don't forget this dude came from... [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4381.18s)]
*  He's been hurt before on the feet. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4384.18s)]
*  Oh, he knows how to handle it. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4386.18s)]
*  As long as you're not going to follow it up with a whole bunch of wrestling and stifling, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4387.18s)]
*  he's standing and do that all day long. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4391.18s)]
*  And his ego is so healthy. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4393.18s)]
*  He's such a nice guy. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4395.18s)]
*  He's the nicest guy. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4397.18s)]
*  It's almost like he's congratulating you for hitting him. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4398.18s)]
*  Good job. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4400.18s)]
*  Got past my defenses there, buddy. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4401.18s)]
*  Good job. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4403.18s)]
*  Well, he does some wild shit too. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4404.18s)]
*  He sneaks that round kick over the shoulder, onto the face. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4406.18s)]
*  I think that's the kick that made him... [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4409.18s)]
*  I mean, that knockout that he has. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4411.18s)]
*  First UFC fight. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4413.18s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4414.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4415.18s)]
*  And he just kind of throws it and comes right over Tom. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4416.18s)]
*  I remember Firasahabi saying that he was the best striker they had ever seen. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4418.18s)]
*  They brought him into training with George St. Pierre. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4422.18s)]
*  And this is a Wonderboy who was in his 20s. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4424.18s)]
*  Wonderboy was a motherfucker. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4426.18s)]
*  I saw him fight live. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4428.18s)]
*  Can I get some of this? [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4429.18s)]
*  Yeah, sure, sure, sure. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4430.18s)]
*  Push that down. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4431.18s)]
*  I saw Wonderboy fight live at Chuck Norris' event. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4433.18s)]
*  Remember Chuck Norris? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4436.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4437.18s)]
*  Dude, I used to watch that all the... [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4438.18s)]
*  Because that was in the prime of, I'm still doing taekwondo and doing all that. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4441.18s)]
*  And I'm like, that's what I want to do. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4445.18s)]
*  Because it was kickboxing. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4447.18s)]
*  See if you can find some of the Wonderboy... [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4449.18s)]
*  What was that called? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4451.18s)]
*  I think it was World Combat League. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4452.18s)]
*  I think you're right. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4453.18s)]
*  I think that's what he called it. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4454.18s)]
*  But I went to see it. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4455.18s)]
*  I believe it was in Atlantic City. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4456.18s)]
*  And it was the first time I met Chuck Norris. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4458.18s)]
*  I was like, oh my God, it's Chuck Norris. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4461.18s)]
*  I couldn't believe I was meeting Chuck Norris. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4463.18s)]
*  And he knew who I was. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4465.18s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4466.18s)]
*  I could die now. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4468.18s)]
*  Chuck Norris. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4469.18s)]
*  Chuck Norris knows my name. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4470.18s)]
*  He came and gave me a hug. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4471.18s)]
*  I was like, holy shit, Chuck Norris gave me a hug. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4472.18s)]
*  But this is Wonderboy when he was in his fucking prime, man. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4475.18s)]
*  And so there was... [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4479.18s)]
*  What we're looking at is, for people that are just listening, is a round platform. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4480.18s)]
*  And it bevels up on the sides slightly. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4485.18s)]
*  So instead of having a barrier, there's like an area, the red area, like a yellow area, the danger track. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4488.18s)]
*  And then the red, where it goes, it slants up. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4497.18s)]
*  And so you know to move around it, which I think was a brilliant idea. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4499.18s)]
*  And I want to say that... [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4503.18s)]
*  I want to say Frank Shamrock was like one of the first guys to use something similar to that in MMA. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4505.18s)]
*  He had an organization that he was doing for a while. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4513.18s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4515.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4516.18s)]
*  Well, dude, it goes back. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4517.18s)]
*  Even think of Bloodsport, right? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4518.18s)]
*  When they, at the final match, they turn up the canvas so that they're forced to the middle. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4520.18s)]
*  I mean, that's basically the concept. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4527.18s)]
*  It's a good concept. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4529.18s)]
*  I like the concept. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4530.18s)]
*  The concept of having like a curved surface. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4531.18s)]
*  But the problem with MMA guys is you can't have that because guys will drive people over the side and slam them. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4535.18s)]
*  You'll be running into that guy with the camera right there. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4540.18s)]
*  See, there's... [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4542.18s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4543.18s)]
*  He caught him with that same kick. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4544.18s)]
*  Over the shoulder. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4545.18s)]
*  He was so good at sneaking that front round kick over the shoulder and like catching you on the chin. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4546.18s)]
*  That guy doesn't have any idea what hit him. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4552.18s)]
*  No, he has no idea. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4554.18s)]
*  Doc Hamilton, that referee, he was one of the first guys to develop an alternative scoring system. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4556.18s)]
*  He had an alternative scoring system to the MMA scoring system. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4561.18s)]
*  Because we still have this 10-point must system that I think is very ineffective. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4565.18s)]
*  Not ineffective, but not comprehensive enough for all the skills. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4570.18s)]
*  With boxing, you could use...the 10-point system is great for boxing. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4575.18s)]
*  Because you're just using hands. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4579.18s)]
*  You can see who won. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4581.18s)]
*  10-9, this guy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4582.18s)]
*  But once you start using takedowns and kicks... [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4583.18s)]
*  That's where it gets so complicated, man. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4586.18s)]
*  There's too many things. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4588.18s)]
*  Too many things. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4589.18s)]
*  Because what do we end up arguing about? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4590.18s)]
*  Or people in general about the fights? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4592.18s)]
*  Well, he got the takedown and the control and landed X, Y, and Z. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4594.18s)]
*  Yeah, but he threw up three submission attempts from his back. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4598.18s)]
*  Or he got taken down three times, but the other guy got up three times. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4601.18s)]
*  So it's like, ugh, it's so freaking hard to score. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4605.18s)]
*  Yeah, and it's very subjective. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4609.18s)]
*  It's very subjective. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4611.18s)]
*  I understand guys will tell you, no, no, we count this, we count that. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4612.18s)]
*  I understand how you're scoring it. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4615.18s)]
*  How you're supposed to score it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4617.18s)]
*  But I still don't think that that's comprehensive enough. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4619.18s)]
*  I don't think we should have a 10-point system. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4622.18s)]
*  I think it should be almost like the amount of strikes landed versus [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4624.18s)]
*  plus the amount of hard strikes landed plus takedown attempts. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4629.18s)]
*  It should take like five minutes to fucking score each round. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4633.18s)]
*  It should take time. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4638.18s)]
*  It should almost be looked at in segments. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4639.18s)]
*  Well, okay, who won the striking? So and so. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4640.18s)]
*  Who won this? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4643.18s)]
*  And then you evaluate, well, maybe that was even. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4644.18s)]
*  And that's the idea, right? [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4646.18s)]
*  That's what the judges are now supposed to be trying to do is view it [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4648.18s)]
*  where they start with the striking. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4652.18s)]
*  But that's the problem is that if you win the striking, you win the round. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4656.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4661.18s)]
*  But takedowns, some people score takedowns very heavily. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4662.18s)]
*  So takedowns and control. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4667.18s)]
*  And it's not supposed to be that way. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4669.18s)]
*  It's supposed to be just a change in position if you don't do anything with it. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4670.18s)]
*  So if you get it, let's say I take you down and I don't throw any strikes. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4673.18s)]
*  But somebody from their back. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4678.18s)]
*  Yeah. And someone's throwing up some Michigan Tanks. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4680.18s)]
*  I'm just glad that I don't have to do it. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4682.18s)]
*  To be completely fair, I would not do well. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4684.18s)]
*  And everybody's like, you guys should be doing the judges. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4687.18s)]
*  Former fighters. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4690.18s)]
*  I'm like, no way. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4691.18s)]
*  I already get enough criticism. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4693.18s)]
*  I certainly don't want to be the guy that's then judging these things. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4695.18s)]
*  We get enough trouble when we say who we think won in a fight. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4698.18s)]
*  But I think at least it would be coming from a place of knowledge. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4700.18s)]
*  It could be subjective and it could be argued and debated. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4703.18s)]
*  But at least no one can say you don't know what you're talking about. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4706.18s)]
*  Whereas there are problems with judges. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4709.18s)]
*  They're not martial artists at all. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4712.18s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4713.18s)]
*  That's like me judging soccer. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4715.18s)]
*  How the fuck are you a martial arts judge and you're not even a martial artist? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4717.18s)]
*  I'd be like me watching a cricket match. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4721.18s)]
*  I remember there was a moment in the middle of a fight in the early days [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4723.18s)]
*  where someone was doing a kimura and one of the judges asked someone else, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4728.18s)]
*  what is he doing? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4734.18s)]
*  And I was like, this is so crazy. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4736.18s)]
*  That judge just asked, what is he doing? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4738.18s)]
*  And this person is responsible for the trajectory of someone's career. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4740.18s)]
*  Like this person has dedicated their entire life to this moment. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4745.18s)]
*  What's a kimura? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4749.18s)]
*  What's a good thing? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4750.18s)]
*  You go like this. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4751.18s)]
*  Imagine if you heard that, if you got a guy in a kimura [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4752.18s)]
*  and you're stepping your leg over the head and you're trying to finish it. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4757.18s)]
*  What's he doing? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4760.18s)]
*  What is he doing? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4761.18s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4762.18s)]
*  You are watching mixed martial arts. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4764.18s)]
*  How did you get that spot? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4766.18s)]
*  They don't know. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4768.18s)]
*  There's parts of it that are kind of Bush League still. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4770.18s)]
*  I just don't think we should have that scoring system. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4774.18s)]
*  I think someone should sit down and develop a... [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4777.18s)]
*  And that's what Doc Hamilton tried to do. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4781.18s)]
*  He tried to develop, I believe Doc called it a half point system. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4783.18s)]
*  And he and I talked about it. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4787.18s)]
*  We had a conversation. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4789.18s)]
*  He explained it to me and I said, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4790.18s)]
*  that definitely sounds better than what we're doing. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4791.18s)]
*  But, you know, something, something, something amazing. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4793.18s)]
*  I also think they should be fighting on a football field. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4797.18s)]
*  I know you still want that fantasy of... [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4799.18s)]
*  Fuck that cage. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4801.18s)]
*  The cage just gets in the way. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4803.18s)]
*  And it also... [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4805.18s)]
*  Now guys know how to fight in the cage. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4806.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4808.18s)]
*  Completely. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4809.18s)]
*  They know how to use it. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4810.18s)]
*  They know how to put their back against the cage to get back up. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4811.18s)]
*  Like if the UFC suddenly threw ropes out there, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4813.18s)]
*  people would be like, what? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4815.18s)]
*  I don't know how to fight anymore. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4817.18s)]
*  Because you're so used to takedowns on the fence. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4819.18s)]
*  Well, if you go to pride, ropes are not the way either. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4822.18s)]
*  Because guys would get caught up in the ropes. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4824.18s)]
*  Stop! [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4826.18s)]
*  And push you back in. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4827.18s)]
*  They're dragging them back. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4829.18s)]
*  I'm like, this isn't good either. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4830.18s)]
*  That's not good either. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4831.18s)]
*  I think a platform, not even a platform, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4832.18s)]
*  just like a flat surface. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4834.18s)]
*  Like a basketball court. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4836.18s)]
*  Yes! [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4838.18s)]
*  If you can play basketball in a court, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4839.18s)]
*  why can't you have an MMA fight in a court? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4841.18s)]
*  No mats? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4843.18s)]
*  Or you like the idea of having them? [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4844.18s)]
*  Because then you're just going to break bones. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4845.18s)]
*  Yeah, you break bones and also head kicks. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4847.18s)]
*  When guys go down, their head bounces off. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4849.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4851.18s)]
*  I fought on a lot of basketball courts [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4853.18s)]
*  in the Taekwondo days. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4855.18s)]
*  Yes! Yeah, me too. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4856.18s)]
*  To the point where you'd made guys wear pads [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4857.18s)]
*  just on the back of their head. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4860.18s)]
*  Because if you got head kicked. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4862.18s)]
*  Yeah, the bounce. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4864.18s)]
*  That's one of the scariest things is the bounce. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4865.18s)]
*  Is this the multiple people fighting? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4867.18s)]
*  Not quite. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4869.18s)]
*  Oh, is this basketball? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4870.18s)]
*  I did see that one. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4872.18s)]
*  Oh my God, and the guys did that. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4874.18s)]
*  Oh my God, so they're barefoot and they broke the glass. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4875.18s)]
*  Leave it to Russia. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4877.18s)]
*  Russia will have like fat men fighting fit women. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4878.18s)]
*  They'll have two on one. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4882.18s)]
*  Car fighting jujitsu? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4883.18s)]
*  Car jujitsu? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4884.18s)]
*  Did you see that? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4885.18s)]
*  They have car MMA too. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4886.18s)]
*  Russia's so crazy. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4887.18s)]
*  They're so crazy with the shit they invent. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4889.18s)]
*  This, I mean, Habib basically made this up. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4891.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4893.18s)]
*  But look at this guy. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4894.18s)]
*  Why would you do that, bro? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4895.18s)]
*  Shatters it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4896.18s)]
*  Because he's being funny. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4897.18s)]
*  That's so dumb. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4899.18s)]
*  And there's no way that's 10 feet. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4900.18s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4902.18s)]
*  Right? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4903.18s)]
*  No. No, of course not. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4904.18s)]
*  No, that's not a real... [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4905.18s)]
*  So now the guy gets the ball [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4906.18s)]
*  and the other guy takes him down. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4908.18s)]
*  Are they allowed to hit him? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4909.18s)]
*  It doesn't seem like they're hitting each other. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4910.18s)]
*  To be honest with you, I don't know if there's many rules to this, but... [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4912.18s)]
*  But it's in a cage and they're playing basketball? [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4914.18s)]
*  This is kind of... [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4917.18s)]
*  This is dumb. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4918.18s)]
*  They just taped... [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4919.18s)]
*  They taped the glass back together. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4920.18s)]
*  That's all. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4922.18s)]
*  So they're scoring points, but they're not... [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4923.18s)]
*  It's just in an octagon. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4925.18s)]
*  And I have seen that thing that Habib and his friends do. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4926.18s)]
*  That's become almost a... [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4928.18s)]
*  I don't know if it's a real sport, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4930.18s)]
*  but I've seen, like, organized versions of it now. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4931.18s)]
*  Well, it looks fun when you watch Habib and his buddies training. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4934.18s)]
*  They just don't dribble, right? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4937.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're just running and holding on to the ball. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4938.18s)]
*  It's like, guys... [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4940.18s)]
*  The whole point of the sport is it's difficult [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4942.18s)]
*  because you've got to dribble the ball. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4945.18s)]
*  Like, NBA's already pushing the boundaries [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4947.18s)]
*  on traveling and walking and all that. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4949.18s)]
*  But they take each other down on the fucking hardwood floor. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4951.18s)]
*  Rug ball, they're calling it. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4955.18s)]
*  So this is a different version of it. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4958.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4960.18s)]
*  This is legit. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4961.18s)]
*  Brutal. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4962.18s)]
*  Brutal. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4963.18s)]
*  Make it... Oh, it's got a good shot. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4964.18s)]
*  Not a bad shot. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4966.18s)]
*  Rug ball's a mix of basketball and wrestling. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4967.18s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4969.18s)]
*  And where? Created and where? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4971.18s)]
*  Russia. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4973.18s)]
*  Russia. Animals. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4974.18s)]
*  There's some tough-ass fucking people. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4975.18s)]
*  If you think right now about the amount of top-flight talent [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4977.18s)]
*  that comes from Eastern Europe and Russia and Dagestan... [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4982.18s)]
*  Dagestan. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4986.18s)]
*  ...and Chechnya, you know? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4987.18s)]
*  I mean, fucking A, man. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4989.18s)]
*  They're all just waiting to take all the titles at this point, too. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4991.18s)]
*  I mean, even in boxing. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4994.18s)]
*  Did you see the Better B fight? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4996.18s)]
*  No. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4997.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4998.18s)]
*  Better B of is so fucking tough. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=4999.18s)]
*  19-0, 19 knockouts. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5002.18s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck, man? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5006.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5009.18s)]
*  They're definitely a step ahead in terms of combat sports, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5011.18s)]
*  whatever it is, whether it's boxing, wrestling, MMA. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5017.18s)]
*  They've got... [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5021.18s)]
*  Is this the guy? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5022.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5023.18s)]
*  I mean, he's such a fucking animal. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5024.18s)]
*  He's from Chechnya. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5025.18s)]
*  And he's 38 years old. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5026.18s)]
*  So it's like he's got to get the big fight. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5028.18s)]
*  He was one of the guys that they were talking about [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5031.18s)]
*  Canelo fighting at light heavyweight. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5033.18s)]
*  And I would have loved to see that, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5035.18s)]
*  because I think his mauling style, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5038.18s)]
*  because he just fucking comes forward, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5041.18s)]
*  and he forces firefights. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5044.18s)]
*  It's very different than most world champions, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5046.18s)]
*  in that he gets in slugfests, and he gets hit. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5049.18s)]
*  But he's super skillful. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5052.18s)]
*  He lost to Usyk in the Olympics. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5054.18s)]
*  Maybe it was the Olympics. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5056.18s)]
*  It was certainly in the amateurs. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5057.18s)]
*  But, you know, top flight amateur [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5059.18s)]
*  and a destroyer as a professional. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5062.18s)]
*  19-0. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5064.18s)]
*  And yard, man, credit to yard, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5066.18s)]
*  because Anthony Yard is a bad man. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5068.18s)]
*  And he's a fucking tough dude. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5070.18s)]
*  He took some horrible shots in this fight. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5072.18s)]
*  But better be of... [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5076.18s)]
*  Just never stops. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5077.18s)]
*  Just constantly coming forward. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5078.18s)]
*  And his technique is fucking flawless. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5080.18s)]
*  I would have loved to see him versus Canelo. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5082.18s)]
*  Yeah, because they both in that. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5085.18s)]
*  I mean, Canelo is another one that's just right in there, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5086.18s)]
*  ready for it. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5089.18s)]
*  Better be of is so much bigger. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5090.18s)]
*  He's a big guy, man. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5092.18s)]
*  Canelo is, you know, started his career. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5093.18s)]
*  He fought Floyd at 152, fought at 154. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5095.18s)]
*  I mean, he's certainly a legit 160, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5099.18s)]
*  and 168, he's great at it. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5102.18s)]
*  But this dude is a legit 75. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5104.18s)]
*  It's a different world. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5106.18s)]
*  And better be of 19-0 with 19 knockouts. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5109.18s)]
*  So he's going to fight Dmitry Bevol next, supposedly, hopefully. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5112.18s)]
*  And that's a really interesting... [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5116.18s)]
*  But again, Bevol, Russian. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5118.18s)]
*  This guy, Chechnyan. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5120.18s)]
*  That fucking world over there, dude. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5122.18s)]
*  Hard people. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5124.18s)]
*  Grow up different, man. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5125.18s)]
*  They're not growing up with tons of money. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5127.18s)]
*  These guys are living on cliffs [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5130.18s)]
*  in the middle of rock villages, you know what I mean? [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5132.18s)]
*  Where they're kicking stones in each other for fun. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5135.18s)]
*  It's true. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5138.18s)]
*  That's going to breed just like a rock village. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5139.18s)]
*  It's going to breed. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5141.18s)]
*  And then you take them, and it's like, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5142.18s)]
*  hey, you could do that. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5144.18s)]
*  You can kick that rock around. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5145.18s)]
*  Or you can come in this gym and learn how to fight. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5147.18s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, that sounds a lot more... [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5149.18s)]
*  You can play basketball where you tackle each other. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5151.18s)]
*  Sign me up for that. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5153.18s)]
*  I'd have been good at that sport. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5154.18s)]
*  Just not the dribbling part. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5156.18s)]
*  Well, you think of war-torn Chechnya. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5159.18s)]
*  I mean, that's where Hamzak Chamayev comes from. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5162.18s)]
*  That's where better be of comes from. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5164.18s)]
*  I mean, it's just... [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5166.18s)]
*  It's an escape to be able to go and box and fight and do MMA. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5168.18s)]
*  And now he's living in Sweden and stuff like that. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5171.18s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5173.18s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5174.18s)]
*  Get to talk trash and be cool. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5175.18s)]
*  Be around nice people. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5177.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5179.18s)]
*  Nobody's trying to kill me right now. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5180.18s)]
*  Yeah, that... [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5182.18s)]
*  I mean, you think about some of our greatest fighters in America [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5183.18s)]
*  grow up in poor neighborhoods. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5186.18s)]
*  These guys grow up in war-torn poor neighborhoods. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5188.18s)]
*  Even levels to that, right? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5191.18s)]
*  Our best guys, yeah, you come from rough neighborhoods. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5193.18s)]
*  I grew up in a rough neighborhood, but I didn't grow up in Chechnya. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5197.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5200.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5201.18s)]
*  South Philly is... [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5202.18s)]
*  Think about what you've got now with like... [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5203.18s)]
*  Nurmagomedov, he steps down, but then you have Umar. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5206.18s)]
*  Umar Nurmagomedov. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5210.18s)]
*  He looks great, man. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5211.18s)]
*  Fucking phenomenal. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5212.18s)]
*  Completely different style. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5213.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5214.18s)]
*  Like, evil striker. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5215.18s)]
*  Just accidentally knocked out a guy now. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5216.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5217.18s)]
*  That was... [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5218.18s)]
*  Sick. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5219.18s)]
*  And then he felt bad about it. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5220.18s)]
*  He was like holding his head. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5221.18s)]
*  I'm like, oh... [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5222.18s)]
*  Such a good guy, right? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5223.18s)]
*  It's awesome to see, but... [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5224.18s)]
*  After follow-up shots, like, oh, you're... [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5225.18s)]
*  Oh, shit, sorry about it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5226.18s)]
*  I didn't know you were sleeping. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5227.18s)]
*  And then you have Islam, who... [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5230.18s)]
*  I mean, how the fuck does that guy make 155? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5232.18s)]
*  When you stand next to him, he's so big. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5235.18s)]
*  He looks like he's 200-plus pounds. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5237.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5239.18s)]
*  He was coming. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5240.18s)]
*  He was knocking on my door when I was fighting for the longest time, too. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5241.18s)]
*  And I was like, these guys are all coming, man. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5244.18s)]
*  Yeah, they're all coming. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5246.18s)]
*  They're all coming. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5247.18s)]
*  Rachmanov at 170. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5248.18s)]
*  Oh, Shavkat. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5250.18s)]
*  Shavkat's in. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5251.18s)]
*  And he's fighting... [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5252.18s)]
*  He's fighting... [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5253.18s)]
*  Jeff Neal. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5254.18s)]
*  Jeff Neal, which is very interesting. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5255.18s)]
*  That's a good fight. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5257.18s)]
*  I hope they stand. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5259.18s)]
*  Because that's... [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5260.18s)]
*  I mean, if you let Jeff Neal have fun on the feet, that guy can kick box, man. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5261.18s)]
*  Oh, he's so accurate. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5265.18s)]
*  He's got that good kick. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5266.18s)]
*  That Mike Perry fight. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5267.18s)]
*  Whoo. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5268.18s)]
*  That high kick, that left high kick. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5269.18s)]
*  Whoo. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5272.18s)]
*  Mike Perry's a maniac. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5273.18s)]
*  He is a maniac. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5274.18s)]
*  Do you know he's the backup for Jake Paul? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5275.18s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5277.18s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5278.18s)]
*  Good for you, Mike Perry. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5279.18s)]
*  Yeah, good for him. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5280.18s)]
*  Here's Shavkat. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5281.18s)]
*  He can do it all, man. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5282.18s)]
*  He can do it all. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5283.18s)]
*  Such a good grappler and elite striker. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5284.18s)]
*  Throws a lot of spinning kicks. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5286.18s)]
*  I called a couple of his early fights, and even then, it was like, this guy's going to [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5288.18s)]
*  be contending for the belt. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5293.18s)]
*  The thing about Shavkat is he's not getting the shine that he deserves. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5294.18s)]
*  I don't think people understand how good he is right now in terms of his overall popularity. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5298.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5303.18s)]
*  That's the problem with a lot of these guys. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5304.18s)]
*  That's why they get slow played the way they do. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5305.18s)]
*  It's not talent. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5308.18s)]
*  These guys are the future of the UFC, no doubt about it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5309.18s)]
*  But you've got to realize that the UFC's, they're trying to promote things. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5314.18s)]
*  It's hard to promote when a guy's just stoic like that. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5318.18s)]
*  It's like, listen, I'm not telling you to change anything, but you can see why. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5321.18s)]
*  You can see both sides. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5325.18s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5326.18s)]
*  Once they get to be a champion, though, then it's okay. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5327.18s)]
*  Yeah, because it's just like, good luck. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5329.18s)]
*  Khabib. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5331.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5332.18s)]
*  Good luck trying to beat this guy. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5333.18s)]
*  Now the story is, who the hell is going to beat this guy? [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5334.18s)]
*  To this day, one of my favorite moments at a weigh-in is Khabib before the Conor fight, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5336.18s)]
*  where he says to the audience, I'm going to smash your boy. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5341.18s)]
*  And he did. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5347.18s)]
*  And he did. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5348.18s)]
*  But it was just, that was like Khabib trash talking, which you never heard. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5349.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5353.18s)]
*  You never heard, but Conor brought it out of him. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5354.18s)]
*  And that's all he needed, that little bit. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5356.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5358.18s)]
*  I'm going to smash your boy. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5359.18s)]
*  And all the Irish people are like, no, no, no. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5362.18s)]
*  Yeah, there's not enough proper 12 in the world to stop that dude from smashing you. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5367.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5373.18s)]
*  It's such an exciting time in terms of the possibilities, the matchups. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5374.18s)]
*  I was very surprised that they decided to do Islam Makachev versus Volkanovsky. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5379.18s)]
*  Right away, too. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5384.18s)]
*  Right away. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5385.18s)]
*  Yeah, very surprised. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5386.18s)]
*  To the point where Volk is facing off with him that night. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5387.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5391.18s)]
*  I mean. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5392.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big fight though. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5393.18s)]
*  We're going to do a fight companion for that. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5394.18s)]
*  So that's on the 11th. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5396.18s)]
*  What else is on the card? [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5398.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, right. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5399.18s)]
*  Trinkets and Josh Emmett. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5400.18s)]
*  Dude, Jack De La Maddalena, that kid. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5401.18s)]
*  That kid came fucking crack. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5404.18s)]
*  He's unbelievable, bro. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5406.18s)]
*  He's good. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5407.18s)]
*  And by the way, rude boy Randy Brown is a test, too. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5408.18s)]
*  That's great. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5410.18s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5411.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5412.18s)]
*  That's a great fight. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5413.18s)]
*  He's long and tall and very, very talented. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5414.18s)]
*  That's a true, he's got a true test on his hands now. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5417.18s)]
*  I like that fight a lot. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5420.18s)]
*  And that's good for Randy, too, because especially going down there, if he goes down there and [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5422.18s)]
*  he beats Jack, shit, man. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5427.18s)]
*  Then he can be like, all right, next fight I want something. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5429.18s)]
*  I want something big at home. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5432.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5433.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5434.18s)]
*  But you almost have to do that in UFC. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5435.18s)]
*  These young guys got to realize that sometimes. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5436.18s)]
*  You want X, Y, and Z. You want the big fights. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5439.18s)]
*  You want these matchups. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5442.18s)]
*  Sometimes you got to suck it up and say, all right, who do you got to give me? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5443.18s)]
*  Where do I got to go? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5446.18s)]
*  Because it's not always going to be sunshine and rainbows. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5447.18s)]
*  Sometimes you got to go fight in Brazil against a Brazilian. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5450.18s)]
*  Sometimes you'll have to go over this, you know, down to New Zealand or go over. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5453.18s)]
*  I remember fighting all over the place. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5456.18s)]
*  I didn't give a shit as long as it was going to put me in a position to move up the rankings [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5458.18s)]
*  and get more money as well. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5463.18s)]
*  If you went to fight in Brazil, how much time would you give yourself to adapt? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5465.18s)]
*  Well, I would do it all different than what I did when I did do it because I only went, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5470.18s)]
*  I think I went down, like it left on like a Tuesday to fight on a Saturday. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5476.18s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5481.18s)]
*  And it was not good. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5482.18s)]
*  It's so hard just to adapt to the jet lag. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5484.18s)]
*  Yeah, I was a mess for that one. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5488.18s)]
*  I was a mess for when I fought when I fought Edson the second time in Abu Dhabi, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5490.18s)]
*  I left on Monday to go fight on Saturday night. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5496.18s)]
*  And I don't think I slept more than three hours every night. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5500.18s)]
*  And I had the worst weight cut of my life because of it. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5503.18s)]
*  I remember calling my mom then, like after I had made weight. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5506.18s)]
*  And I don't remember much of that conversation with my mom. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5510.18s)]
*  That's when she was like, you need to I want you to seriously consider not doing this anymore. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5514.18s)]
*  Oh, my God. Imagine that's your boy. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5519.18s)]
*  You talk to me, your son, your son's about to fight in a cage fight and he can barely talk. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5521.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is cut and wait. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5525.18s)]
*  There's a couple of those situations with the weight cuts, man. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5527.18s)]
*  The five day notice fight with RDA was. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5530.18s)]
*  Yeah, I remember calling Christine, who's, you know, we're married now. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5535.18s)]
*  But at the time we were I don't even think we were engaged. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5539.18s)]
*  And I remember making her. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5541.18s)]
*  Can you can you go in the fridge and get a can of coke and pour it over ice for me just to watch it? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5543.18s)]
*  That's how thirsty I was. I wanted to watch her pour coke. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5551.18s)]
*  This is not granted. This is like 1230 in Vegas. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5556.18s)]
*  So it's like three in the morning back home. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5560.18s)]
*  I wake her up to pour soda over ice for me. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5562.18s)]
*  She must be like, Joe, kind of fucking maniac. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5566.18s)]
*  I found ASMR videos of people drinking sodas. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5568.18s)]
*  You could probably pull that up chugging ice cold soda. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5574.18s)]
*  So they have they have the microphone like right on their throat so you can hear them gulping these ice cold sodas. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5577.18s)]
*  Now, you've got to realize I cut like 18 pounds or something crazy. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5584.18s)]
*  And I'm dry heaving in the bathtub and just watching all night because Butler, my manager, for a while was, you know, making sure I was OK. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5587.18s)]
*  Is this? Yep. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5595.18s)]
*  This video is 10 million views. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5597.18s)]
*  It's 10 million views. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5599.18s)]
*  I'll do it so you can imagine. You're thirsty. You're so thirsty. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5601.18s)]
*  I just want to be this guy. Oh, he's going to drink it out of the bowl. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5605.18s)]
*  He's pouring. He's pouring Fanta into a bowl filled with ice. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5610.18s)]
*  It just sounds. He's going to chug it. He's going to slurp it all down. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5616.18s)]
*  Is that blueberry Fanta? I don't know, but I'm I didn't even know there was a blueberry. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5620.18s)]
*  Blue raspberry. Oh, wow. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5624.18s)]
*  He's going to slurp it. Oh, how weird is that? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5627.18s)]
*  That that's a thing that people love ASMR. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5630.18s)]
*  I didn't know. I still don't watch any ASMR. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5633.18s)]
*  But at the time, I couldn't I couldn't stop watching it. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5637.18s)]
*  I didn't sleep one hour the night that I saw Friday or no Thursday into Friday. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5644.18s)]
*  We did the whole way cut. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5652.18s)]
*  I still had like a pound that I was hoping to float, which I did end up doing. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5653.18s)]
*  But the whole night, I was one fifty six and a half or whatever I was. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5657.18s)]
*  And the whole entire night, I had a severe headache. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5661.18s)]
*  It was dry heaving and watching stuff like that. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5665.18s)]
*  Isn't it so insane that fighters will literally get to death's door the day before you fight? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5668.18s)]
*  Crazy. Twenty five minutes. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5676.18s)]
*  If there's a thing that I could take away from fighting to eliminate, that would be the thing, because I feel like it's sanctioned cheating. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5678.18s)]
*  I feel like that's what it is. It's 100 percent. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5685.18s)]
*  I mean, it's what you're doing. It's 100 percent. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5688.18s)]
*  You know that you have to weigh one fifty five. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5691.18s)]
*  I was I mean, I would walk into the cage one hundred and eighty two pounds. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5693.18s)]
*  That's so nuts. So nuts. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5697.18s)]
*  But you pay a price for that. Yeah. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5700.18s)]
*  And if out of all the things that you've done, that's the one thing that you think you know. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5702.18s)]
*  And the reason that I keep talking, you know, I've I've thought about a comeback and we've kind of teased it and everybody even the coaches around me. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5706.18s)]
*  The reason they'd be interested is because we want to see what I'd be capable of being a healthy fit. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5715.18s)]
*  If I could mix now how I've learned to train my my system with the triathlon training and having my triathlon coach, this guy, David Tilbury Davis, who I were. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5722.18s)]
*  He's super science on everything, right? [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5734.18s)]
*  Breaking things down, the mitochondria and how you got to do zone one work versus this. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5737.18s)]
*  If I could mix that in with my MMA training and start applying that to grappling and sparring days, because you start thinking about athletes, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5742.18s)]
*  the best athletes in the world and how they prepare and then how they go and fight. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5751.18s)]
*  We're so ass backwards and fighting. It makes no fucking sense. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5756.18s)]
*  We're just beating the shit out of each other and then showing up and hoping for the best on fight day. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5760.18s)]
*  There needs to be much. You're seeing more of it now where people are being a little more scientific with the approach. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5766.18s)]
*  But I mean, I would just for me, when I was go hard all the time, five, five minute rounds, then five, five minute rounds in the bag, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5771.18s)]
*  then five, five minute rounds of jumping rope, go to bed, eat 200 calories, wake up, do it all over again. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5780.18s)]
*  And it's like, oh, no wonder by four weeks in the training camp, I wanted to, you know, I didn't want to fight anymore. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5787.18s)]
*  Yeah. It's like, well, now if you know what, what do you think you would try to weigh now to get down to 55? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5793.18s)]
*  Like right around where I'm at now, like 170 something. Yeah. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5801.18s)]
*  I mean, I think I could easily be walking around as I am now all the time. Well, well below 180 pounds. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5804.18s)]
*  Well, look at Frankie. Frankie won the title. Frankie was basically cutting no weight when he beat BJ Pat. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5811.18s)]
*  He's probably eating to even weigh 155 pounds. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5817.18s)]
*  Look, he ends his career at 35, which is pretty wild. You think that he was the champion at 55. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5820.18s)]
*  And fighting guys like Ben Henderson, who is Gray Maynard. He was just solid, man. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5826.18s)]
*  Gray Maynard was a big fella. He was big back then. He was a big fella. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5832.18s)]
*  I mean, now, but even think now, like compared to the lightweights now, he's not even that big. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5835.18s)]
*  No, no. Some of the light. Well, imagine Makashev. I mean, Makashev is so big. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5840.18s)]
*  Who else is a massive lightweight? And his fucking squeeze. I mean, what is his squeeze like? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5845.18s)]
*  You see his back when he got that arm triangle on Charles. Just the traps and all that. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5851.18s)]
*  Yeah. You can tell. When a guy like Charles taps as fast as he did that, you know that guy's got just a gorilla grip. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5856.18s)]
*  Well, his squeeze was evident in the Drew Dober fight, too, because Drew Dober is fucking he's a gorilla, too. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5864.18s)]
*  And he's as tough as they come. Look at some of these comeback fights that he's had recently. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5870.18s)]
*  That last fight. Bobby Green. Holy shit. Holy shit. He was styling on him. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5874.18s)]
*  And it's like, you can't sleep on Drew for a second. Nope. Nope. Drew caught him. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5880.18s)]
*  That was one of the fights I always thought I was going to have and it never, never turned out. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5885.18s)]
*  His chin is like a fucking fire hydrant. Just he's such a gigachad. Like the way he's built. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5889.18s)]
*  Right. His fucking giant head. He's a guy in college. If we were in college together, I would have hated that. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5894.18s)]
*  So handsome. Look at this pretty boy. He's so handsome. I hate him. Got abs. Beautiful hair. Strong. Great hair. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5899.18s)]
*  Seems like a nice guy. Fuck. Yeah, right. Got everything going for him. He must be a piece of shit. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5904.18s)]
*  Well, I think he's, you know, I think that Makashev fight ignited something in him as well. Yeah. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5910.18s)]
*  I think when you get the rub, when you fight someone who's that good and you realize, okay, everything on the level, I got to ramp it up. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5915.18s)]
*  Sometimes people don't realize what those levels are, which is why being around elite fighters is so critical for a fighter's early day. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5922.18s)]
*  Because you mirror the people that you're training with. Yeah. You know, if you were in a gym filled with elite assassins, like you are forced to be at that level. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5930.18s)]
*  Or you go home and you don't come back. You know what I mean? You just stop. But if you keep showing up. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5940.18s)]
*  Bilal's depiction of what it was like to train with Khabib and be in that camp with them and what those guys do. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5945.18s)]
*  They're crazy. But that's why they're so good. He'd be like, we'd get done these, you know, he told you, these epic sessions. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5951.18s)]
*  And then Khabib would be like, all right. And then he takes him for another like 25 minutes just grinding on him after the fact. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5958.18s)]
*  He was like the warm up sometimes. He's like, we got to work out. That's not the workout. Yeah. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5964.18s)]
*  They're doing push, burnout push ups and stuff at the end to squats and planks. Yeah. But that's what it takes. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5971.18s)]
*  You know, it was interesting talking to we talked to Dan Ege before his last fight and he it he loves strength and conditioning. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5978.18s)]
*  Right. And I did too when I was a fighter and he felt very conflicted because you've got a guy like Khabib who's telling him don't do that. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5988.18s)]
*  You don't need that stuff. You need to just do what he's doing. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5995.18s)]
*  But what Dan realized and I think if you saw his last fight, something clicked in him and I think he's starting to trust himself. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=5999.18s)]
*  You can't always just emulate just because somebody is the greatest ever. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6005.18s)]
*  And what works for Khabib is not necessarily going to always work for you. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6009.18s)]
*  And he was like, I needed to do strength and conditioning. I needed to do this stuff because he was trying to just do what other people were telling him to do for the longest time. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6014.18s)]
*  And he was kind of falling short. Well, George came to that conclusion to George St. Pierre came to that conclusion. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6021.18s)]
*  He decided at some point in time that strength and conditioning wasn't important. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6026.18s)]
*  And what was really important was efficiency and just technical proficiency, strategy and efficiency and movements and his martial arts movements. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6029.18s)]
*  But obviously you're coming you're talking about a guy like George who's already in Adonis. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6040.18s)]
*  Yeah, he's already very strong. And so he had this physical strength already. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6044.18s)]
*  And to enhance that and make himself even stronger is not really going to improve his fighting. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6050.18s)]
*  What really was improving his fighting was just technique and efficiency. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6055.18s)]
*  Yeah, and getting better at fighting stuff. Yeah. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6059.18s)]
*  And you're going to gain strength specific for fighting by grappling. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6063.18s)]
*  You can't get some of those muscle groups the way that you need to get them to fire. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6069.18s)]
*  The only way to do that is to just freaking get that squeeze and you can do that all day. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6074.18s)]
*  You know, you can pull on the bands and you can simulate a lot of that stuff. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6079.18s)]
*  But there's nothing that's ever going to replace trying to control somebody with your legs and their upper body. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6082.18s)]
*  And at the same time, control your breathing and heart rate and try to then squeeze. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6089.18s)]
*  It's just it's unlike it's unlike anything else. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6093.18s)]
*  Eddie Bravo used to always explain it like tying your shoes. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6097.18s)]
*  He's like, you got to get a technique down to the point where you do it automatically. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6101.18s)]
*  You don't even think about it. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6105.18s)]
*  When you tie your shoes, you don't think about tying your shoes. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6106.18s)]
*  You just go, yeah, and you tie your shoes. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6108.18s)]
*  He's like, that has to be how your technique comes out. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6110.18s)]
*  You can't be like consciously thinking about it while you're applying it. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6112.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6115.18s)]
*  You can get it to that point. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6116.18s)]
*  And then it's obviously when you're drilling it and executing constantly over and over again. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6118.18s)]
*  You know, some guys just have a tech. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6123.18s)]
*  You remember Paul Sass? [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6125.18s)]
*  Yeah, he had a triangle from hell. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6126.18s)]
*  That motherfucker triangle, everybody and everybody knew stay out of his triangle. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6129.18s)]
*  Didn't matter. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6133.18s)]
*  Doesn't matter. Yeah. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6134.18s)]
*  He just had this in that movement. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6135.18s)]
*  He had that movement down so tight and so fluid that no matter what, if you were in his guard, just slap that motherfucker on you. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6138.18s)]
*  I mean, look at Habib and and Islam and you know they're going to try to take you down. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6147.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6152.18s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6153.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6154.18s)]
*  Can't stop. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6155.18s)]
*  They don't and they don't hide it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6156.18s)]
*  I'm going to take it down. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6157.18s)]
*  I'm going to smash you and I'm going to smash you out. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6158.18s)]
*  Smash. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6159.18s)]
*  Smash. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6160.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6161.18s)]
*  And he did it over and over and over again. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6162.18s)]
*  He's going to do it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6163.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6164.18s)]
*  I mean, who's been more dominant in their career? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6165.18s)]
*  Because like he arguably lost a round versus Connor and he had that difficult fight with Glace and Tebow early in his career. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6167.18s)]
*  That was a close fight. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6177.18s)]
*  Other than that, just a smash fest. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6178.18s)]
*  Smash fest. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6182.18s)]
*  Smash fest. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6183.18s)]
*  And you know, you know a guy's dominant when you talk about, wow, so-and-so lasted five rounds with him. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6184.18s)]
*  Yeah, he got crushed. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6191.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6193.18s)]
*  But he lasted. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6194.18s)]
*  Ally Quinta. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6195.18s)]
*  Tough as shit. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6196.18s)]
*  Talked about that. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6197.18s)]
*  Ally Quinta gave a great account of himself. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6198.18s)]
*  Got that fight over me. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6199.18s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6200.18s)]
*  I remember that. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6202.18s)]
*  That was one of those weird ones where they told Max Holliway to stop cutting weight. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6203.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6207.18s)]
*  That was New York. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6208.18s)]
*  Yeah, dude, they had all kinds of stuff going on to make him make weight. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6209.18s)]
*  They had that room turned into like a furnace. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6214.18s)]
*  I swear to God, they were bringing up like butane, fricking heaters and shit into the room. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6217.18s)]
*  The hotel, they're just trying to hide it all from the hotel lobby in New York, but they're bringing up all this stuff, all these heated blankets, all this stuff. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6222.18s)]
*  And I remember talking to those guys back then. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6229.18s)]
*  I think he was going to make weight, but the doctor, once he saw all that, he's like, I can't. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6232.18s)]
*  Well, I can't allow this anymore. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6237.18s)]
*  The doctors, if they saw that doctor saw everyone make weight, they'd stop it. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6239.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6244.18s)]
*  This is what Humsot said. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6245.18s)]
*  Humsot said he would have made weight. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6246.18s)]
*  And by the way, that was in New York as well, right? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6248.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6250.18s)]
*  Just once they see it, they're going to. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6251.18s)]
*  Get them out of there. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6253.18s)]
*  Of course it's bad for our health. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6254.18s)]
*  Of course. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6256.18s)]
*  It's fucking horrible. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6257.18s)]
*  Go cut four pounds, it's bad for your health. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6258.18s)]
*  Imagine what these guys are doing, especially Max in that particular situation. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6261.18s)]
*  I remember thinking it was a joke. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6266.18s)]
*  Do you remember it was like April 1st when the news came out that Max was stepping in? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6268.18s)]
*  Who was originally? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6274.18s)]
*  Tony Ferguson. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6275.18s)]
*  He tore his fucking knee. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6276.18s)]
*  Because he was wearing sunglasses. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6277.18s)]
*  He wasn't. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6278.18s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6279.18s)]
*  I said that and I apologize to Tony because everybody thought that because Tony wore sunglasses a lot. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6280.18s)]
*  But no, he just tripped over some fucking loose wires. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6285.18s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6289.18s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6290.18s)]
*  He was probably wearing sunglasses. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6291.18s)]
*  I don't think he was. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6292.18s)]
*  I don't think he was. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6293.18s)]
*  They said he wasn't. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6294.18s)]
*  He tripped over some fucking wires. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6295.18s)]
*  He was probably kicking a pole right before that. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6296.18s)]
*  But how crazy is that? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6299.18s)]
*  He tore his fucking knee, tripping over some wires. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6300.18s)]
*  And it was April 1st when the news came out about that. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6302.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6305.18s)]
*  And everybody's like, no, I swear to God it's not an April Fool's joke. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6306.18s)]
*  I remember sitting in the basement at Duke's thinking it was an April Fool's joke. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6309.18s)]
*  To this day, I wish Tony fuck could be when Tony was in his prime. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6313.18s)]
*  Because Tony in his prime, you know, people see him get knocked out by Michael Chandler [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6317.18s)]
*  and they see him lose to Nate. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6321.18s)]
*  They see these fights. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6322.18s)]
*  It's a damn shame, man. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6323.18s)]
*  That's a long road of a battered body from war. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6324.18s)]
*  100%. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6329.18s)]
*  And if Tony Ferguson, when he was at the top of the heap, was a fucking boogeyman. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6330.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6334.18s)]
*  He was the boogeyman, man. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6335.18s)]
*  He really was. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6336.18s)]
*  He wasn't wearing my shades. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6337.18s)]
*  I wasn't wearing my shades. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6338.18s)]
*  I actually had my prescription sunglasses on. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6339.18s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6342.18s)]
*  That's still sunglasses. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6343.18s)]
*  That's still sunglasses, Tony. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6346.18s)]
*  Tony Ferguson, the type of guy to not be wearing sunglasses while wearing sunglasses. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6347.18s)]
*  Those Tony Ferguson is the type of guy memes are amazing. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6354.18s)]
*  I hope he takes that and enjoys it and isn't mad about it. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6357.18s)]
*  But I feel like Tony Ferguson is the type of guy to get mad about it. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6361.18s)]
*  He gets mad. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6363.18s)]
*  He got mad because I called him a brilliant weirdo. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6364.18s)]
*  You are, bro. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6366.18s)]
*  He's so unusual. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6368.18s)]
*  I mean, he's just his style of moving. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6369.18s)]
*  And he would catch you with these weird punches. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6371.18s)]
*  And he would train on a wing-chung dummy. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6374.18s)]
*  Eddie Bravo was working with him. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6377.18s)]
*  And they were in Big Bear. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6379.18s)]
*  And he said Tony was in such fucking insane shape that everybody else in camp would be running sprints. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6381.18s)]
*  Tony would lap them. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6388.18s)]
*  He would run these hills, run back down while these guys were still running and lap them going up the hills. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6390.18s)]
*  I forget who it was. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6395.18s)]
*  Maybe Jeremy Stevens went and trained with him for a little bit and hung out with him. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6398.18s)]
*  And he would say that Tony would wake up. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6402.18s)]
*  I think it was Jeremy Stevens said it. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6403.18s)]
*  But he would be like, man, he just wake you up at like two in the morning. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6405.18s)]
*  We're running. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6408.18s)]
*  And he would just go and do these sprints. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6409.18s)]
*  That's Floyd Mayweather. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6411.18s)]
*  Floyd Mayweather would do that too. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6412.18s)]
*  He would go to a club, drink water, hang out with everybody, and then run 10 miles home. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6413.18s)]
*  But that's what it takes to be a lead. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6418.18s)]
*  I just don't think Tony got his chance. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6420.18s)]
*  I mean, Tony beat Kevin Lee. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6422.18s)]
*  And he beat some really good guys. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6424.18s)]
*  And he won the interim title. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6427.18s)]
*  That's definitely the fight that got away from. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6429.18s)]
*  Yes, got away. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6431.18s)]
*  That would have been a really amazing fight. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6433.18s)]
*  John Jones and Ghana was another one now where we're all like, ah. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6435.18s)]
*  That might still happen. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6438.18s)]
*  Could happen. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6439.18s)]
*  That could still happen. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6440.18s)]
*  But will it happen when we all want it to happen? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6441.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6445.18s)]
*  If it happens in four years from now. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6446.18s)]
*  But it doesn't have to happen in four years. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6447.18s)]
*  Here's my thing. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6448.18s)]
*  Again, Mr. Incano, please hear me out. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6449.18s)]
*  Don't sign any deals. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6451.18s)]
*  I mean, just for legacy and just for also money. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6452.18s)]
*  I think the big money is if he has an account. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6457.18s)]
*  What if he knocks out Dillion White? [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6461.18s)]
*  What if they set him up with some boxer who's an elite boxer, not Tyson Fury? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6464.18s)]
*  And he goes and wins a big fight. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6469.18s)]
*  You've got to remember, Incano is 265 ripped natural. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6471.18s)]
*  Cut in weight to probably be at 265. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6477.18s)]
*  With canned hams for fists. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6479.18s)]
*  Just giant. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6481.18s)]
*  He's a fucking specimen. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6483.18s)]
*  And the power is extraordinary. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6485.18s)]
*  And if he's just punching and not worrying about takedowns. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6487.18s)]
*  If one of those fights, look at Wilder. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6491.18s)]
*  Wilder, who's the greatest knockout artist ever. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6494.18s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6497.18s)]
*  Greatest. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6498.18s)]
*  He's a one punch knockout artist. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6499.18s)]
*  I would say, I mean, you have your George Foremans and Mike Tyson are the most beautiful combinations we've ever seen in the heavyweight division. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6501.18s)]
*  But Wilder just. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6508.18s)]
*  Pure power. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6510.18s)]
*  Blap. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6511.18s)]
*  Did you see his last fight? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6512.18s)]
*  It wasn't even. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6513.18s)]
*  Moving away. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6514.18s)]
*  Moving away. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6515.18s)]
*  He hits this guy. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6516.18s)]
*  This guy's stiff. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6517.18s)]
*  He has one Ortiz. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6518.18s)]
*  When he hit Ortiz in the forehead. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6520.18s)]
*  Pull that up. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6522.18s)]
*  Pull up. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6523.18s)]
*  Wilder knocks out Ortiz. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6524.18s)]
*  Because he hit him. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6526.18s)]
*  And Ortiz is a durable guy. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6528.18s)]
*  A tough guy. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6530.18s)]
*  And he had Wilder in some trouble in that fight. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6531.18s)]
*  And Wilder just blap. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6533.18s)]
*  He don't blap right in the forehead. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6535.18s)]
*  Head snaps back and Ortiz's eyes are rolled back. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6537.18s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck just hit me? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6539.18s)]
*  Those are the things you can't train. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6541.18s)]
*  That is God's gift to you. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6543.18s)]
*  And again, it's that long frame like you were talking about. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6544.18s)]
*  Yeah, look at another lean. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6546.18s)]
*  Look at that. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6547.18s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6548.18s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6549.18s)]
*  Watch this. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6550.18s)]
*  Here it goes again. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6551.18s)]
*  Bam. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6552.18s)]
*  I mean, look at Ortiz. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6553.18s)]
*  Ortiz is like, what? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6555.18s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6556.18s)]
*  He's just like trying to put his mouthpiece back in. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6557.18s)]
*  You don't even know it. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6560.18s)]
*  His mouthpiece is in. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6561.18s)]
*  He's still trying to find it. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6562.18s)]
*  His legs aren't moving. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6563.18s)]
*  He's like, wait a minute. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6564.18s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck? [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6565.18s)]
*  Look at his face. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6566.18s)]
*  He's like upset about it. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6567.18s)]
*  He's confused. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6569.18s)]
*  Wilder. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6570.18s)]
*  Preposterous power. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6571.18s)]
*  But it just goes to show you like there's levels. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6572.18s)]
*  Look at the chin of Tyson Fury. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6575.18s)]
*  Tyson Fury, the 12th round in that first fight, drops him. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6576.18s)]
*  Dead. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6580.18s)]
*  Right hand, left hook, and even does this like it's over. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6581.18s)]
*  Like I got him. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6583.18s)]
*  I got him. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6584.18s)]
*  Nope. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6585.18s)]
*  He rises from the dead. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6586.18s)]
*  Rises. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6587.18s)]
*  I remember watching that one live and I couldn't believe it. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6588.18s)]
*  I was like, oh, that's it. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6591.18s)]
*  He's done. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6592.18s)]
*  Alone in my bedroom screaming. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6593.18s)]
*  Alone in my bedroom screaming, oh my God, he's winning the 12th round. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6596.18s)]
*  I was, my wife was in the other room like, what the fuck are you yelling at? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6599.18s)]
*  I'm like, he's winning the fucking 12th round. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6602.18s)]
*  This is insane. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6604.18s)]
*  He almost gets killed. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6605.18s)]
*  He gets back up and he wins. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6606.18s)]
*  Plan B option if Usyk fight fails to happen is in Ghanu. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6608.18s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6612.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6613.18s)]
*  Well, the Usyk fight's gonna happen. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6614.18s)]
*  It's the most important fight in boxing. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6616.18s)]
*  I think that fight is gigantic because you got Usyk who's, you know, beats Joshua twice [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6618.18s)]
*  and the best movement in boxing and skillful. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6624.18s)]
*  He's a heavyweight Lomachenko. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6629.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6630.18s)]
*  And he was the Cruiserweight Champion. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6631.18s)]
*  He's an undersized heavyweight. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6632.18s)]
*  And you got Tyson who's as big a heavyweight as you're ever gonna see. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6634.18s)]
*  Massive. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6637.18s)]
*  Six-nine, long as fuck. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6638.18s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6640.18s)]
*  Agile with back fat. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6641.18s)]
*  Like. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6643.18s)]
*  That picture right there. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6644.18s)]
*  I couldn't tell him his pants were falling down or. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6645.18s)]
*  Go back to that picture, Jamie. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6647.18s)]
*  The picture you just showed, the Usyk, the backup fight, that he's a backup fighter, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6649.18s)]
*  the one that you just had up. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6653.18s)]
*  If you look, the rolls of fat off his back. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6654.18s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6657.18s)]
*  That back fat is insane. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6658.18s)]
*  Peak male performance right there. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6660.18s)]
*  The bodybuilder. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6662.18s)]
*  So you beat the bodybuilder. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6663.18s)]
*  You haven't fought the Gypsy King. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6665.18s)]
*  They're crazy, dude. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6667.18s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6668.18s)]
*  His dad's out of his mind, too. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6669.18s)]
*  I love him. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6670.18s)]
*  I love that guy. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6671.18s)]
*  Tyson Fury versus Alexander Usyk headed to Wembley in April. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6672.18s)]
*  Huge boost to British boxing fans. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6676.18s)]
*  What a fucking fight that's gonna be. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6678.18s)]
*  My God, that's gonna be amazing. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6680.18s)]
*  I just don't know if Usyk has the size to deal with that guy. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6682.18s)]
*  It's gonna be interesting to see. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6685.18s)]
*  What strategy he employs, whether or not he can avoid the big bombs and the reach and the length. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6687.18s)]
*  He's so long. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6693.18s)]
*  But. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6694.18s)]
*  Not the long lean type that we're talking about. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6695.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6697.18s)]
*  A little different. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6699.18s)]
*  A little different. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6700.18s)]
*  I mean, he doesn't give a fuck what his body looks like. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6701.18s)]
*  He's just a fighter. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6704.18s)]
*  Is he still, is he sober? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6705.18s)]
*  Is he not sober? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6708.18s)]
*  No, no. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6709.18s)]
*  He's back on the sauce now? [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6710.18s)]
*  He just doesn't drink in camp. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6711.18s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6713.18s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if he's sober. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6714.18s)]
*  I don't think he's sober. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6715.18s)]
*  He's always, well, he's, that's what I mean. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6716.18s)]
*  That's why I'm asking. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6718.18s)]
*  I know he goes back and forth on, you know, he's right in the head and then he's not. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6719.18s)]
*  And then you'll see him in a clip and he's had, you know, 14 pints. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6723.18s)]
*  Memento! [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6726.18s)]
*  Well, you know, he's an inspirational story. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6727.18s)]
*  I mean, he really is. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6730.18s)]
*  I mean, the guy was like, he beats Vladimir Klitschko. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6731.18s)]
*  He becomes a heavyweight champ and then loses his fucking mind. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6736.18s)]
*  He's drinking constantly, almost committed suicide, was driving his Ferrari, thinking about just fucking driving off a cliff. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6739.18s)]
*  And then gets it together and becomes a heavyweight champion again. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6745.18s)]
*  And then wasn't fully all the way back when he fought Wilder. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6749.18s)]
*  And then fights Wilder in the rematch. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6753.18s)]
*  And then now he's fucking tuned up and ready. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6755.18s)]
*  Beats the brakes off of Wilder. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6757.18s)]
*  And then the third fight, Wilder catches him with a bomb. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6759.18s)]
*  That bomb that he caught him where you see the fat ripple all the way down to his body. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6763.18s)]
*  Any other human, any other human that Wilder catches. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6768.18s)]
*  Is not getting back up. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6771.18s)]
*  Any other human. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6772.18s)]
*  Nobody punches like Wilder. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6773.18s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6774.18s)]
*  Because you like we talked about it's just it's in him. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6775.18s)]
*  It's not he's not doing something in the gym with a trainer to get that kind of power. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6779.18s)]
*  That's you were born with that gift. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6783.18s)]
*  It's also being a gypsy and being around that fucking rough tumble brawling world his whole life. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6785.18s)]
*  His dad's a fighter, his brother's a fighter. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6792.18s)]
*  Everyone's a fighter around them. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6795.18s)]
*  Just fucking savages. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6797.18s)]
*  Just in the bones. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6799.18s)]
*  In the bones. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6801.18s)]
*  Gypsy people man. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6802.18s)]
*  Whenever he talks about retiring I'm like not yet. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6804.18s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6807.18s)]
*  I think that if he does beat Usyk it's still possible because they're going to fight in April right. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6808.18s)]
*  Unless Ngannou decides to take a big money boxing fight before that which I don't blame him for doing. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6814.18s)]
*  But god damn it if he beats Usyk that's really the only compelling interesting thing for him in that division. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6820.18s)]
*  I mean what else would be compelling? [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6828.18s)]
*  The Joshua fight? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6830.18s)]
*  Not really not after the Usyk fights. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6832.18s)]
*  I mean unless Joshua comes back because they're talking about Joshua fighting Wilder right. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6834.18s)]
*  Isn't that the talk? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6839.18s)]
*  No. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6840.18s)]
*  They're talking about Ortiz fighting Wilder right. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6841.18s)]
*  No. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6843.18s)]
*  Ruiz. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6844.18s)]
*  Andy Ruiz right. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6845.18s)]
*  That's what they're talking about. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6846.18s)]
*  So Andy Ruiz they're talking about him fighting Wilder. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6847.18s)]
*  If that's look Wilder versus Ngannou would be crazy. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6850.18s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6855.18s)]
*  How about that fight? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6857.18s)]
*  I just think as long as he gets something. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6858.18s)]
*  Yeah I just want to get that. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6861.18s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6862.18s)]
*  If you're going to leave that contract on the table I hope you get some big fights man because that was a big payday to leave behind. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6863.18s)]
*  They offered more money than any heavyweight before but I think the sticking point and I'm talking out of school here because I don't know just what I've read. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6870.18s)]
*  The sticking point I think was that he wanted to be able to go off and do boxing. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6877.18s)]
*  To his credit he's like hey Conor McGregor did it. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6881.18s)]
*  Why can't I do it? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6885.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6886.18s)]
*  And I get it. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6887.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6888.18s)]
*  I get it. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6889.18s)]
*  I get it. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6891.18s)]
*  But if I'm getting hundreds of millions of dollars a fight on the table it's hard to. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6892.18s)]
*  Conor made a hundred million dollars in the fight. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6897.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6900.18s)]
*  That's generational wealth. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6901.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6903.18s)]
*  How do you fucking see that? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6904.18s)]
*  But he locked out where the UFC wanted to partner with that and make that happen right. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6905.18s)]
*  That's where that whole situation and that's what Ngannou I guess wanted too and it's just like man they probably did that one time and we're like alright you know what. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6908.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6915.18s)]
*  That was a whole lot. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6916.18s)]
*  What's also if the boxer beats up the UFC fighter. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6917.18s)]
*  Yeah how many times do you want to sign up for that? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6921.18s)]
*  You can't get the boxer to fight UFC. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6923.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6925.18s)]
*  The thing is no one wants to do that. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6926.18s)]
*  No one wants to do that. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6927.18s)]
*  Which I you know what drives me nuts though is these they still will go and talk all this trash a lot of these boxers. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6928.18s)]
*  It's like you guys know that given a street fight rules you're getting your ass kicked. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6935.18s)]
*  I mean you're getting your ass kicked. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6941.18s)]
*  I don't care who you are. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6942.18s)]
*  An amateur fighter will kill you. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6943.18s)]
*  Yeah they're just going to take you down. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6944.18s)]
*  You're getting you're getting choked out. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6945.18s)]
*  Yeah you get leg kicked. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6947.18s)]
*  You won't be able to stop a take down. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6948.18s)]
*  They can sit there and just do this to you for 25 minutes if they want. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6949.18s)]
*  Any like elite imagine imagine any elite wrestler that gets in there with a boxer. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6953.18s)]
*  The boxer has zero chance of not being taken down. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6959.18s)]
*  Literally zero. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6961.18s)]
*  Unless that boxers like Crawford like Terrence Crawford has a background in wrestling. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6962.18s)]
*  Yeah then. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6968.18s)]
*  That's fucking interesting. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6969.18s)]
*  And if you don't know that and you're like I'm just going to take this guy down. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6970.18s)]
*  He spalls on you that one time. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6973.18s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6974.18s)]
*  Can you imagine the panic that would set in. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6975.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6978.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6979.18s)]
*  I can't take him down. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6980.18s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6981.18s)]
*  Now I got to box this guy. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6982.18s)]
*  That's a fight that we're missing out to him and Earl Spence. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6983.18s)]
*  That's a fight we're missing out on. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6986.18s)]
*  That bums me out. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6988.18s)]
*  I got to follow my. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6989.18s)]
*  I mean with so much we have so many fights now with the UFC that it's even hard for me to to keep track of. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6991.18s)]
*  All the boxing stuff that's going on. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=6999.18s)]
*  We have fights every weekend. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7001.18s)]
*  I keep track of that. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7003.18s)]
*  I keep track of Jiu Jitsu. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7004.18s)]
*  I keep track of all the elite kickboxers. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7005.18s)]
*  That's why I was so excited when Pahetta fought in the UFC. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7008.18s)]
*  Because you've been following him for a while. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7011.18s)]
*  Well I was telling Dana a while ago. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7012.18s)]
*  I was like this guy just fought. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7014.18s)]
*  He just fought MMA. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7015.18s)]
*  I remember watching Izzy back when he was still kickboxing. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7016.18s)]
*  So when that debut came up I was excited about that. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7020.18s)]
*  A friend of mine had been telling me about him for a while. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7023.18s)]
*  He said you got to watch this guy style. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7025.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7026.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7027.18s)]
*  I contacted Izzy way before he fought in the UFC and I asked him about it. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7028.18s)]
*  And Izzy played it real smart. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7031.18s)]
*  He was like they give me a lot of money to fight in China. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7033.18s)]
*  He's getting a lot of money. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7035.18s)]
*  And he's like I want to do this the right way. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7036.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7037.18s)]
*  And get really prepared. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7038.18s)]
*  And to his credit he did it perfectly. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7039.18s)]
*  Then what's the point? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7041.18s)]
*  Congratulations you got offered a UFC contract and you just got wrestled to death. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7042.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7046.18s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7047.18s)]
*  There's no point because he turned it down a few times I think. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7048.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7050.18s)]
*  They were trying to get him even earlier but. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7051.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7052.18s)]
*  He did it the right way. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7053.18s)]
*  He did it the right way. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7054.18s)]
*  You know what these guys are going to try to do. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7055.18s)]
*  If you come in with that kind of kickboxing pedigree they're going to take you down. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7056.18s)]
*  What do you think he does in the rematch? [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7059.18s)]
*  What do you think he does differently? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7061.18s)]
*  Obviously he was that calf kick. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7063.18s)]
*  Yeah he was doing really well and he had hurt him really bad. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7065.18s)]
*  Almost had him stop in the first round. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7068.18s)]
*  Right away I couldn't believe it. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7070.18s)]
*  I was like oh my god. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7071.18s)]
*  Right hand left hook at the bell. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7072.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7074.18s)]
*  But I had to came back in that second round like it never happened. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7075.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7079.18s)]
*  He's so big dude. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7080.18s)]
*  Do you see when he's standing next to Jamal Hill? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7081.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7083.18s)]
*  When he's like staring down Jamal Hill. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7084.18s)]
*  Just melting his face. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7085.18s)]
*  As soon as I saw that and as I was there I didn't know what it hadn't been translated [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7086.18s)]
*  yet. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7092.18s)]
*  I didn't know what Glover was saying and he kept pointing back at Alex and I'm like oh [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7093.18s)]
*  shit he's setting up this fight now. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7097.18s)]
*  He's going to retire and he's setting up this fight and it wasn't what he was saying. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7099.18s)]
*  He was saying he was going to focus on training. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7102.18s)]
*  Training him. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7104.18s)]
*  Pedeta. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7105.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7106.18s)]
*  At first I thought Jamal's open to it. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7107.18s)]
*  Oh man I love that fight. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7109.18s)]
*  I love Jamal man. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7110.18s)]
*  Dude that guy. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7111.18s)]
*  So good. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7112.18s)]
*  So good. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7114.18s)]
*  Has a lot of potential. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7115.18s)]
*  And getting better all the time. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7116.18s)]
*  And he took that fight. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7118.18s)]
*  I mean he didn't have a full training camp. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7119.18s)]
*  Right and still fought five hard long rounds. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7121.18s)]
*  Against one of the most. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7124.18s)]
*  Extreme pace. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7125.18s)]
*  Doorwalled sons of bitches. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7126.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7127.18s)]
*  That UFC has ever seen. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7128.18s)]
*  And showed grappling talent. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7129.18s)]
*  Jamal showed grappling. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7130.18s)]
*  And he's been saying that since the beginning. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7131.18s)]
*  Even when he was on Contender Series and we were talking to him. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7133.18s)]
*  He's like I know I'm known for these knockouts but he was telling everybody listen I got [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7136.18s)]
*  really good Jiu Jitsu. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7139.18s)]
*  Finally got to show it. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7141.18s)]
*  I mean if you can escape those positions. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7142.18s)]
*  In a title fight against somebody like Glover Teixeira in Brazil. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7144.18s)]
*  And get out and do what you did. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7148.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7150.18s)]
*  And did you see the Yuri Prohaska thing. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7151.18s)]
*  Oh my god. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7153.18s)]
*  So find the Yuri Prohaska reaction. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7154.18s)]
*  Did you see Jamal's. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7157.18s)]
*  And Jamal's reaction to Yuri. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7158.18s)]
*  Where you at though. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7160.18s)]
*  Jamal's so funny. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7161.18s)]
*  Jamal I don't want to say it because you need to see it. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7162.18s)]
*  Jamal's so funny. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7165.18s)]
*  He's funny on Instagram too. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7166.18s)]
*  He's low key funny too. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7167.18s)]
*  The way he. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7168.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7169.18s)]
*  It's just that subtle. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7170.18s)]
*  It's subtle funny because I saw him. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7171.18s)]
*  We were upstairs at the hotel because all our flights were leaving like crazy late from [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7173.18s)]
*  Brazil and he had seen that video and he's like where is he getting the internet out [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7177.42s)]
*  there. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7183.18s)]
*  Is he watching the fight out in the woods. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7184.18s)]
*  Was he watching it or did he watch it and then go out into the woods. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7185.18s)]
*  I'm like yeah I'm not sure. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7189.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7191.18s)]
*  Fine. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7192.18s)]
*  Yeah that's it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7193.18s)]
*  Play this so we can hear it. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7194.18s)]
*  Play it. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7196.18s)]
*  No do it. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7197.18s)]
*  Do it so we can hear the whole thing. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7199.18s)]
*  OK. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7201.18s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7202.18s)]
*  He's out in the snow. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7203.18s)]
*  I'm coming. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7207.18s)]
*  I'm coming. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7210.18s)]
*  No but then Jamal's response to that. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7214.18s)]
*  They have it back to back. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7219.18s)]
*  Here we go. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7221.18s)]
*  Where you at though. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7223.18s)]
*  Where you at though. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7226.18s)]
*  By the way that's what she said. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7228.18s)]
*  That's what she said. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7231.18s)]
*  But where you at though. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7233.18s)]
*  He's the man. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7238.18s)]
*  He's the man and you know you talk about a guy who's got crazy power too and just intelligence [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7239.18s)]
*  of how to get that fucking power to your chin. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7246.18s)]
*  I think that's what was underrated and now I think after this last fight people are a [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7248.18s)]
*  little more aware of that but he's very calculated. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7253.18s)]
*  Very. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7256.18s)]
*  Very calculated striker even though it looks like it's coming from one orthodox angles [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7257.18s)]
*  when I talked to him afterwards the head kick was planned. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7260.18s)]
*  Like they knew in order to switch Southpaw seamlessly without kind of giving everything [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7263.18s)]
*  away that was their plan. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7268.18s)]
*  It was like when we switch Glover's going to see we're switching. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7269.18s)]
*  So what are we going to do to kind of stifle him for a second so that we can transition [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7272.18s)]
*  into that. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7277.18s)]
*  Left high kick. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7278.18s)]
*  Best thing you can do man is just throw a bomb because you have to address the head [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7279.18s)]
*  kick. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7283.18s)]
*  You throw a body kick a guy like Glover what's he going to do. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7284.18s)]
*  He's going to catch it. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7286.18s)]
*  He's going to take down even if you hurt him he's going to drive through and potentially [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7287.18s)]
*  get the takedown. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7290.18s)]
*  You throw it to the head. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7291.18s)]
*  You're not catching head kicks. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7293.18s)]
*  Unless you get lucky it bounces off and they you know treetop you but chances are they're [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7295.18s)]
*  going to go like this. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7300.18s)]
*  Yeah it was interesting because he caught him a couple of times that head kick and wobbled [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7302.18s)]
*  Glover. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7306.18s)]
*  He's got like a size 16 foot. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7307.18s)]
*  So think about it Glover's blocking it. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7309.18s)]
*  The big old foot is just wrapping around the side of his head. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7311.18s)]
*  You know better than anybody even if you block it just the impact. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7314.18s)]
*  It rattles you. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7317.18s)]
*  Rattles everything and I was even saying on the broadcast that it's a good idea even if [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7318.18s)]
*  it doesn't hit his head for people at home we were talking about the leg kicks. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7322.18s)]
*  Go ahead like this and let me take a baseball bat. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7326.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7329.18s)]
*  Block this baseball bat. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7330.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7331.18s)]
*  It's going to hurt even on your forearms. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7332.18s)]
*  By the way he kicks harder than you can swing a baseball bat too. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7334.18s)]
*  People need to know that too. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7338.18s)]
*  Yes because it's coming from down here and your leg is bigger than a baseball bat. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7339.18s)]
*  Yeah and especially if someone has like real power in their hips and knows how to really [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7343.18s)]
*  swing it. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7347.18s)]
*  I think he needs to keep developing that. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7348.18s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7349.18s)]
*  If he can keep developing that left kick and get a little more flexible because you can [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7350.18s)]
*  tell he's just hammering it up there. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7353.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7355.18s)]
*  It's like if he starts working that and gets sneaky behind maybe setting it up with kind [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7356.18s)]
*  of like Leon did against Kamara where you set it up with that cross kind of pump faking. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7361.18s)]
*  So many good fights in that weight class right. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7366.18s)]
*  You have Yuri who's coming back gets the shoulder surgery which hopefully not too soon though [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7369.18s)]
*  man. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7374.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7375.18s)]
*  Because apparently that was a pretty devastating injury that he had. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7376.18s)]
*  I don't know what he all tore in there but. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7378.18s)]
*  Tell the story what happened because it's kind of crazy. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7381.18s)]
*  You know the story with Yuri? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7383.18s)]
*  No. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7385.18s)]
*  His shoulder gets out of socket in training camp which is dangerous enough right. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7386.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7390.18s)]
*  So his camp they try to put the shoulder back in. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7391.18s)]
*  They yank on it and they tear it to shreds. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7394.18s)]
*  So the doctor the UFC doctor said it was the worst shoulder injury he had ever seen. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7397.18s)]
*  That's what I heard. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7402.18s)]
*  That's not good. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7403.18s)]
*  I forgot that they said that. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7404.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7405.18s)]
*  People trying to put it back in place. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7406.18s)]
*  Everybody just sees a video of a doctor doing that. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7407.18s)]
*  It's like. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7409.18s)]
*  Well you have to also recognize too and I hope Yuri knows this and if he doesn't maybe he's [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7410.18s)]
*  listening. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7415.18s)]
*  Your muscle tissue will heal faster than your connective tissue your tendons your ligaments. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7416.18s)]
*  You feel good but it's not ready. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7421.18s)]
*  That's why guys blow out their ACL again after doing it like they get their surgery. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7424.18s)]
*  I'm good to go. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7429.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7430.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7431.18s)]
*  No man. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7432.18s)]
*  Not good to go. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7433.18s)]
*  Ed Herman did that right. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7434.18s)]
*  He gets the ACL surgery recovering from ACL surgery feeling pretty good blows it out again. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7435.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7439.18s)]
*  That's really common. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7440.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7441.18s)]
*  Because the ligaments even though they feel ready the tissue around them is strong. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7442.18s)]
*  The actual ligaments themselves are not. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7446.18s)]
*  They take a long time. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7448.18s)]
*  The blood supply is very weak. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7449.18s)]
*  That's one of those injuries that. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7451.18s)]
*  Shoulders are rough. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7455.18s)]
*  Shoulders and ACLs. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7456.18s)]
*  I mean I had minor injuries throughout fighting to my knee thank God like meniscus stuff that [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7458.18s)]
*  they go in and. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7464.18s)]
*  Yeah but even that your knees kind of compromised. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7465.18s)]
*  To this to this day because I'm missing the whole inside part of it. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7468.18s)]
*  If I'm just standing around I can kind of like shake it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7473.18s)]
*  I can feel that it's. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7476.18s)]
*  Yeah it wobbles. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7477.18s)]
*  Yeah it wobbles. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7478.18s)]
*  I'm missing that on my inside of my left leg too. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7479.18s)]
*  Yeah it wobbles. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7481.18s)]
*  There's no cushion there. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7482.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7483.18s)]
*  I got an insufficiency fracture from skiing because I fell and my knees clashed into each [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7484.18s)]
*  other because there's no ligament. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7490.18s)]
*  There's no meniscus on that side. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7492.18s)]
*  There was a crack. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7494.18s)]
*  I was like some is wrong. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7495.18s)]
*  Yeah that makes sense. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7496.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7497.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7498.18s)]
*  Even if you run too much with no meniscus which is probably what I'm doing to myself [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7499.18s)]
*  at the moment. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7503.18s)]
*  I'm sure you do. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7504.18s)]
*  And my hip. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7505.18s)]
*  You know like your hip bone. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7506.18s)]
*  What runs across that. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7508.18s)]
*  Is that part of your IT man that runs like literally across your. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7509.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7513.18s)]
*  Do you get it worked on. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7514.18s)]
*  Do you get it looked at. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7515.18s)]
*  I'm so bad at all that stuff. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7516.18s)]
*  Are you. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7517.18s)]
*  You just. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7518.18s)]
*  I'm just gonna. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7519.18s)]
*  I'm gonna go. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7520.18s)]
*  You're saying that about blood work like if I don't want to look at it. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7521.18s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7524.18s)]
*  Like Christine is she's like you need to go get your kidneys looked at. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7525.18s)]
*  I'm like I don't. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7530.18s)]
*  Does it bother you. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7531.18s)]
*  No no. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7532.18s)]
*  Do they bother you. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7533.18s)]
*  Sometimes I got a little twinge. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7534.18s)]
*  Back on the right side here and I think it's. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7535.18s)]
*  Did you ever get kidney stones. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7538.18s)]
*  Never kidney stones but I did have like I had the rabdo after the hooker fight and I was [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7540.18s)]
*  peeing. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7547.18s)]
*  In Coca Cola. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7548.18s)]
*  And that's how I knew. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7549.18s)]
*  And I mean I several times. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7551.18s)]
*  What did they do to fix the rabdo. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7552.18s)]
*  Flushed the shit out of me with IVs basically and made me wait in the hospital until my [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7555.18s)]
*  levels in the blood they kept just taking little samples of blood. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7562.18s)]
*  Rabdo is something that a lot of CrossFit people get. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7565.18s)]
*  Yeah you just work your you work your muscles so bad they start to break apart and like [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7568.18s)]
*  like I forget what starts to go poisons your blood basically. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7573.18s)]
*  Yeah basically. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7578.18s)]
*  Rabdo myelosis right. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7579.18s)]
*  Myelosis right. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7581.18s)]
*  Rabdo myelosis. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7582.18s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7583.18s)]
*  But it's very sketchy stuff. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7584.18s)]
*  Yeah it looks like you're peeing straight cola. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7586.18s)]
*  Well that's that when people say oh there's no such thing as over training. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7588.18s)]
*  Well there are 100 percent. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7591.18s)]
*  Most certainly is. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7593.18s)]
*  You can literally destroy your kidneys from doing it. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7594.18s)]
*  Yeah you could die. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7597.18s)]
*  And you could die. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7598.18s)]
*  And I think a lot of it for me was it was because of the damage to my actual muscles [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7599.18s)]
*  which was causing it. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7604.18s)]
*  And because it wasn't the weight cut for that one. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7605.18s)]
*  That one I was dialed in for that one so I know it wasn't putting too much strain that [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7607.18s)]
*  but 25 minutes of a dude hammering your calf. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7612.18s)]
*  Calf starts to break. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7616.18s)]
*  It was probably starting to break apart. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7617.18s)]
*  It almost had compartments. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7619.18s)]
*  This is the hooker fight. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7620.18s)]
*  This is the hooker fight. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7621.18s)]
*  Yeah and I broke my orbital. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7622.18s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7623.18s)]
*  That's a lot of stuff going on. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7624.18s)]
*  Oh dude for the longest time I was seeing like I was getting double vision. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7626.18s)]
*  It's fine since retiring it's finally going away. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7631.18s)]
*  But if I look to my right even now like if I was looking at you this eye would start [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7634.18s)]
*  to kind of do its own thing a little bit. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7639.18s)]
*  Not anymore though. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7642.18s)]
*  It's been good. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7643.18s)]
*  When Balaw was telling me about getting his surgery. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7644.18s)]
*  When he got poked. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7646.18s)]
*  Yeah and then he fucked up the other eye as well. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7647.18s)]
*  It's like you realize these guys. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7650.18s)]
*  You know about that guy that Russian cat that's fighting the UFC just signed him he has one eye. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7652.18s)]
*  Oh I saw that yeah. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7657.18s)]
*  I didn't know he had one eye though. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7659.18s)]
*  He's got one eye. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7660.18s)]
*  I thought it was just discolored. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7661.18s)]
*  No no no it's useless. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7662.18s)]
*  It's gone. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7663.18s)]
*  Yeah his right eye and I guess they're going to let him fight. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7664.18s)]
*  Which I always thought that Bisping gamed the system which I think he did. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7667.18s)]
*  Yeah he kind of like. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7671.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7672.18s)]
*  Well Bisping would pretend that he could see out of it so he would memorize the eye chart. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7673.18s)]
*  And so fucking how tough is that guy. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7678.18s)]
*  He's a G bro. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7681.18s)]
*  How tough is that guy. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7682.18s)]
*  Guy fought 11 fights in the UFC including winning the world title and defending the world title with one eye. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7683.18s)]
*  With one eye. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7688.18s)]
*  Fucking animal. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7689.18s)]
*  Fucking animal. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7690.18s)]
*  It's so crazy you'll be sitting on which side is it? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7691.18s)]
*  Which side is it? [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7694.18s)]
*  It's his right eye. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7695.18s)]
*  It's his right eye. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7696.18s)]
*  And man like he'll bump in I mean it's legit. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7697.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7700.18s)]
*  I'm doubting Michael. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7701.18s)]
*  No he literally can't see out of the eye. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7702.18s)]
*  And I remember when it went bad the Vitor fight. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7705.18s)]
*  Vitor head kicked him. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7708.18s)]
*  And worse for wear is that was super sauced up Vitor. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7709.18s)]
*  Sauci Vitor. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7714.18s)]
*  Sauci Vitor. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7715.18s)]
*  That was back in the days where they allowed them to do testosterone replacement therapy. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7716.18s)]
*  Which is so crazy. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7721.18s)]
*  It's like oh I need some testosterone. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7722.18s)]
*  It's like you don't need that much. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7724.18s)]
*  Well that was what was crazy about MMA is that you know it's such a new sport. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7726.18s)]
*  Is that there was so much shenanigans that was allowed. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7732.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7735.18s)]
*  Like look if they started the UFC today if the sport started from scratch you think they'd allow extreme weight cutting? [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7736.18s)]
*  No they would if you were going to start it from the beginning. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7741.18s)]
*  They'd be hydration testing. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7744.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7745.18s)]
*  They would do it. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7746.18s)]
*  I don't know how one FC is doing it because apparently on one of the most recent one FC cards nine people failed their weight cut. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7747.18s)]
*  Because they're trying to. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7753.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7754.18s)]
*  They didn't make weight. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7755.18s)]
*  So like I don't know what the fuck do you do with that. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7756.18s)]
*  And when I'm looking at those guys in one FC I'm like I don't go to your drug test. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7760.18s)]
*  Well that's where it's like wait a minute. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7764.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7767.18s)]
*  We're worried about them cutting weight. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7768.18s)]
*  Meanwhile these guys are taking every supplement known to mankind. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7769.18s)]
*  It's like I don't know if we should be worried about the weight cutting. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7774.18s)]
*  Including private diuretics. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7776.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7778.18s)]
*  Well maybe not if they're doing the hydration test. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7779.18s)]
*  Well yeah. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7782.18s)]
*  I was talking to Eddie a while ago about it when he was fighting for one FC and he was kind of talking about how he had to do the weight cut thing and how much you had to weigh. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7784.18s)]
*  But I don't remember all the specifics but I know it's you have to have a certain level in your urine or something like that so that they know. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7794.18s)]
*  But how about that fucking cat that he fought in his first his first one fight. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7802.18s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7808.18s)]
*  Nastia Yukan. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7809.18s)]
*  Is that his name? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7810.18s)]
*  Oh I don't even remember. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7811.18s)]
*  I think it's Timothy. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7812.18s)]
*  I think is literally the first letters of his name are nasty. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7813.18s)]
*  Is that Eddie Alvarez. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7816.18s)]
*  He fought this fucking animal. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7820.18s)]
*  It's like you need to know. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7822.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7824.18s)]
*  Look at Nastia Yukan. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7825.18s)]

*  Fucking tank. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7831.18s)]
*  So big. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7832.18s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7833.18s)]
*  And you know when you look at the size of that motherfucker. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7834.18s)]
*  That's natural. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7837.18s)]
*  Ruthless striker. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7838.18s)]

*  Oh is he was he the one that was crushing Eddie's legs. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7842.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7845.18s)]
*  He stopped Eddie. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7846.18s)]
*  He stopped Eddie and Eddie's first fight back. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7847.18s)]
*  First fight there. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7849.18s)]
*  Eddie's tough dude. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7850.18s)]
*  I've trained with him. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7851.18s)]
*  Tough as shit. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7852.18s)]

*  I mean look Eddie you know fought 55 in the UFC. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7861.18s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7874.18s)]
*  There's not like the world class talent is not limited to the UFC. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7875.18s)]
*  We're getting these guys that enter into the UFC and they're elite already. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7878.18s)]
*  They already have the 20 and 0 some of these guys. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7881.18s)]

*  And McKinney's a bad motherfucker dude. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7906.18s)]
*  McKinney when he put it on Drew Dober and almost had Drew Dober out in that fight and showed how durable Drew Dober is. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7909.18s)]
*  And Drew Dober recovered and survived and went up winning the fight. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7915.18s)]
*  I was like damn McKinney's a future champion. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7918.18s)]
*  But this fucking guy. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7920.18s)]

*  I see his brother was watching back there. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7927.18s)]
*  Look at that flying knee. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7928.18s)]
*  Right on the neck. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7929.18s)]
*  I talked to Terrence after that and I was like. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7930.18s)]
*  He's like bro thank god that hit me here. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7933.18s)]
*  He's like my teeth would have been gone. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7935.18s)]
*  Yeah because he didn't have his mouthpiece in at that time. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7937.18s)]
*  Which I was wondering why the referee didn't put the mouthpiece back in. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7939.18s)]
*  Because there was a lot of time there between the mouthpiece falling out. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7942.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7945.18s)]
*  I think we said it. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7946.18s)]
*  We were like why wouldn't you put this in here. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7947.18s)]
*  What a brilliant flying knee though. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7949.18s)]
*  I mean the way he set it up shows him the right switch knee. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7951.18s)]
*  And you know that was what Faraz Sahabi was talking about when he justified the stoppage with Israel versus Paheta. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7954.18s)]
*  He was like nobody has a better switch knee than Paheta. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7961.18s)]
*  Oh. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7965.18s)]
*  If you're lingering your head in front of that dude. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7966.18s)]
*  That motherfucker. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7968.18s)]
*  Stop the fight now. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7969.18s)]
*  Please. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7970.18s)]
*  You're not coming. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7971.18s)]
*  You're not going to come back the same person after a knockout like that. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7972.18s)]
*  Because you're already messed up. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7974.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7976.18s)]
*  And then you let Paheta smash you in the face with a flying knee. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7977.18s)]
*  With one of the most powerful moves in all of MMA. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7979.18s)]
*  Yeah I know. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7981.18s)]
*  If you watch his fight with Jason Willness in glory. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7982.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7984.18s)]
*  Where he stops Willness with that flying knee. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7985.18s)]
*  His fucking and the first fight he had in the UFC where he knocked that cat out with flying knee. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7987.18s)]
*  And that guy taking him down a bunch and then it's just all takes one of those. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7991.18s)]
*  And it's a game changer. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7995.18s)]
*  Yeah but these guys like Bon Fim and his brother. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=7997.18s)]
*  His brother the other Bon Fim. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8000.18s)]
*  It's Israel and. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8002.18s)]
*  Ishmael. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8003.18s)]
*  Ishmael. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8004.18s)]
*  And Gabriel. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8005.18s)]
*  Gabriel. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8006.18s)]
*  And Gabriel won by guillotine. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8007.18s)]
*  Both those guys fucking talented. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8008.18s)]
*  And both against legit dudes. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8010.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8012.18s)]
*  Gabriel fought Mounir Lezzez. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8015.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8017.18s)]
*  He's a good fighter. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8018.18s)]
*  Very good fighter. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8019.18s)]
*  And he made him shoot. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8020.18s)]
*  He made him panic shoot. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8022.18s)]
*  Yup. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8023.18s)]
*  He pressured the shit out of him. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8024.18s)]
*  And he made him. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8025.18s)]
*  And that's his thing. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8026.18s)]
*  He's like go ahead. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8027.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8028.18s)]
*  And it's funny they're both so well rounded. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8029.18s)]
*  But you can tell Gabriel forces guys into these grappling exchanges. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8031.18s)]
*  Whereas Ishmael you can tell that dude just wants to take your head off. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8035.18s)]
*  But both. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8039.18s)]
*  They can both do either one. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8040.18s)]
*  Both either one. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8042.18s)]
*  And also like the movement and management of distance is fucking phenomenal. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8043.18s)]
*  Like elite world class. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8047.18s)]
*  I mean that's what I said when you watch that fight. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8049.18s)]
*  I'm like you're watching these guys in their debut fight in the UFC. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8051.18s)]
*  Because they've been tested against legit talent. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8054.18s)]
*  If you look at the records of the guys they fought. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8056.18s)]
*  They fought some legit dudes. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8058.18s)]
*  Whereas back in the day you know you could be 10 and 0 getting into the UFC. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8060.18s)]
*  And you didn't fight. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8064.18s)]
*  You might have fought one or two guys at the end there to get Joe Silva's attention back in the day. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8065.18s)]
*  Because I remember when you were trying to get in. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8070.18s)]
*  He'd be like can you. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8071.18s)]
*  You got to go beat somebody. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8072.18s)]
*  Right. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8074.18s)]
*  For me to sign you. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8075.18s)]
*  You could be 15 and 0. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8076.18s)]
*  But if you've beaten a bunch of guys that are all 0 and 10. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8077.18s)]
*  You're going to get here with a great record and then get murdered. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8079.18s)]
*  Joe Silva is so brutal. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8084.18s)]
*  He's so brutal. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8085.18s)]
*  He sent my ass to Brazil. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8086.18s)]
*  Because we begged for a guy that was in the top 15. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8088.18s)]
*  He's like sure here you go. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8091.18s)]
*  Got to go fight Masuda Nduba down in Brazil. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8092.18s)]
*  Anybody else. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8094.18s)]
*  He's like that fight or no fight. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8095.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8097.18s)]
*  OK. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8098.18s)]
*  But I guess you kind of have to be like that. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8099.18s)]
*  But then if you got hurt though. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8101.18s)]
*  And I had a good relationship with Joe. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8102.18s)]
*  But one time when I hurt my knee. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8104.18s)]
*  I had to pull out. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8106.18s)]
*  He's like unbelievable. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8107.18s)]
*  You're hurt. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8110.18s)]
*  You got to pull out. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8111.18s)]
*  Great. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8112.18s)]
*  But what do you want me to do. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8113.18s)]
*  I tore my meniscus. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8114.18s)]
*  What do you want me to do. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8115.18s)]
*  I had a bucket handle tear. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8116.18s)]
*  That's the worst. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8118.18s)]
*  I was at Cowboys Ranch doing this. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8119.18s)]
*  I was wheeling around in a chair. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8120.18s)]
*  Because I couldn't stand up. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8121.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8122.18s)]
*  Those are the bucket handle tears what I had. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8123.18s)]
*  It locked up. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8124.18s)]
*  It locks up. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8125.18s)]
*  That's horrible. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8126.18s)]
*  Terrible feeling. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8127.18s)]
*  I tried to rehabilitate mine. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8128.18s)]
*  I actually got it stitched up. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8129.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8130.18s)]
*  Because it was the same knee that I tore my ACL. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8131.18s)]
*  And I got it stitched up. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8132.18s)]
*  But you just can't. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8133.18s)]
*  The meniscus just goes man. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8134.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8135.18s)]
*  Once it's just. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8136.18s)]
*  Wear and tear man. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8137.18s)]
*  Do you know they're doing meniscus replacements now. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8138.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8139.18s)]
*  Back when I had it. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8140.18s)]
*  They're using cadaver meniscus now. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8141.18s)]
*  They're taking. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8142.18s)]
*  But apparently they're using a lot of meniscus. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8143.18s)]
*  They're using a lot of meniscus. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8144.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8146.18s)]
*  Back when I had it. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8147.18s)]
*  They're using cadaver meniscus now. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8148.18s)]
*  They're taking. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8149.18s)]
*  But apparently as you get older it's less and less effective. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8150.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8153.18s)]
*  Because it probably won't take. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8154.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8155.18s)]
*  Blood flow. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8156.18s)]
*  It's just a blood flow thing. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8157.18s)]
*  But I always wonder. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8158.18s)]
*  When they say blood flow. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8159.18s)]
*  Are they talking about that for elite athletes? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8160.18s)]
*  How much blood flow are we talking about? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8162.900000000001s)]
*  If you're talking about for a regular person. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8164.26s)]
*  Maybe because they're not training and they're not going to rehabilitate it to the extent [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8166.780000000001s)]
*  that a guy like you would do. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8170.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8171.14s)]
*  Getting a meniscus versus us getting one who are going to go and work out every day. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8172.660000000001s)]
*  It's going to be a different situation. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8176.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8178.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8179.42s)]
*  But I don't know. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8180.42s)]
*  I mean I always just thank God for medical science. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8181.42s)]
*  Because just think about it. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8183.900000000001s)]
*  I have both my ACLs reconstructed. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8184.900000000001s)]
*  I would be a hobbling mess of a man if I lived at any other time. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8186.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8190.900000000001s)]
*  My friend Steve. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8191.900000000001s)]
*  You'd be broken. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8192.9s)]
*  I'd be broken. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8193.9s)]
*  I wouldn't be able to do it. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8194.9s)]
*  And I can do everything. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8195.9s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8196.9s)]
*  I mean I'm 55. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8197.9s)]
*  And my body works as good as it worked when I was 30. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8198.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8200.62s)]
*  Hormone replacement and stem cells and peptides and all that shit. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8202.1s)]
*  It's amazing what you can do now. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8205.54s)]
*  When I was a kid I thought of a 55 year old man. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8207.460000000001s)]
*  That's a dead man. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8210.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8211.42s)]
*  That's not a guy with a six pack who's throwing kettle bells around. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8212.42s)]
*  It's a totally different world. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8215.5s)]
*  It is. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8216.5s)]
*  It is different. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8217.5s)]
*  I mean I thought the same thing. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8218.5s)]
*  If you thought of somebody that was even over 45 I'd be like oh man. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8219.94s)]
*  Time to settle in and get old. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8226.140000000001s)]
*  When I was a kid, when I was 19 years old, I used to work at an athletic club. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8227.26s)]
*  I worked at the Boston Athletic Club and Bobby Orr used to come in and work out. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8230.62s)]
*  And Bobby Orr who was one of the greatest hockey players that's ever lived. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8234.38s)]
*  Bobby Orr can barely walk. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8237.3s)]
*  This poor guy because he's had those old school surgeries where they would cut your leg open [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8239.14s)]
*  like a fish. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8243.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8244.58s)]
*  You're screwed. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8245.58s)]
*  And just bolt things down and staple it together. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8246.58s)]
*  Bobby would get on the VersaClimber machine and we would have to help him get on this [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8247.78s)]
*  machine because his legs would go. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8252.1s)]
*  This is the range of motion. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8254.9s)]
*  It goes from this to this. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8256.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8258.02s)]
*  Never fully extended. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8259.18s)]
*  Look at that's his knee. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8260.18s)]
*  Bro when you see it in real life it's like a brain. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8262.7s)]
*  Yeah it's horrible. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8265.74s)]
*  And again I'm sure he probably has knee replacements now. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8267.58s)]
*  But like when they worked on his knee back then look it's black and white photos. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8271.62s)]
*  Look at his knees there. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8276.140000000001s)]
*  That photo there with the two of them with the see the big scar. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8277.18s)]
*  The color one down there. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8279.7s)]
*  Don't make me bust out the fucking thing. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8281.34s)]
*  I don't think that's him. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8282.34s)]
*  That's not him? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8283.34s)]
*  No it just says old guy hockey. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8284.34s)]
*  Old guy hockey. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8285.34s)]
*  Knee replacement. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8287.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8288.26s)]
*  But those big slices like that. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8289.26s)]
*  Well they do knee replacements now. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8291.939999999999s)]
*  You know Kelly Starrett who's a very famous strength and conditioning coach he blew his [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8294.5s)]
*  knee out and eventually got a knee replacement and he says it's amazing. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8299.42s)]
*  He said he could do everything with it. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8303.3s)]
*  And Michael Bisping. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8305.18s)]
*  Both of his knees. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8306.18s)]
*  Yeah he's got two of them. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8307.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8308.18s)]
*  Old guy hockey. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8309.18s)]
*  I think for me it's always it's just gonna be my hip someday. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8310.18s)]
*  It's gonna go. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8312.539999999999s)]
*  No doubt. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8313.539999999999s)]
*  Well have you got any stem cells in there? [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8314.539999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8316.26s)]
*  I don't know but you'd be amazed. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8317.380000000001s)]
*  You'd be amazed at what they can do. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8318.94s)]
*  Take a trip down to Columbia my friend. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8321.58s)]
*  I see everybody doing these things now. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8323.74s)]
*  Well you know Al Jermain's doing that right now. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8326.22s)]
*  Al Jermain there was an article I read this morning. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8328.18s)]
*  Al Jermain is trying to avoid bicep surgery. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8330.1s)]
*  He has a torn biceps and he's going down to Columbia right now to get it shot up. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8332.460000000001s)]
*  Because they're trying to get him to fight. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8339.22s)]
*  They're trying to get him to fight Henry Sohuto in April. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8343.06s)]
*  Sooner than he wants. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8346.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8347.58s)]
*  So here we are right now and we're in February. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8348.58s)]
*  So you got March, April. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8351.02s)]
*  Yeah I don't like it. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8352.82s)]
*  What does it say? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8354.5s)]
*  Next week I'm off to Medellin, Columbia for bioaccelerator stem cell treatment program. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8355.5s)]
*  Very optimistic this will get me back and ready to compete sooner than later. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8359.86s)]
*  Well this is where I'm a big fan of the Conor McGregor approach to avoiding the USADA testing [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8363.78s)]
*  pool. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8369.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8370.98s)]
*  You know? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8371.98s)]
*  Just to heal up. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8372.98s)]
*  I don't know what Conor did. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8373.98s)]
*  He's outside of that pool but I've never seen a guy get that big before. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8375.539999999999s)]
*  That big and just recovered from a broken shin. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8378.82s)]
*  Like it was no big deal. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8385.06s)]
*  I mean look at Chris Weidman. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8386.06s)]
*  He was having all kinds of complications with that thing. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8387.619999999999s)]
*  It's not an easy surgery to come back from and infections and stuff like that can start [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8389.859999999999s)]
*  to happen. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8393.699999999999s)]
*  Look at Luke Rockhold who couldn't even get over a staph infection. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8394.699999999999s)]
*  He still puts on sleeves on that shin. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8398.26s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8400.98s)]
*  But that is better than the break. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8403.3s)]
*  The break is very rare that someone comes. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8406.14s)]
*  Anderson is the only guy that's really come back. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8409.539999999999s)]
*  Weidman still hasn't come back. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8412.06s)]
*  No. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8413.3s)]
*  He hasn't had a fight since that fight with Uriah. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8414.3s)]
*  It's a devastating move. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8418.099999999999s)]
*  And also Tyrone Spong when he fought Gokan Saki. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8419.66s)]
*  Same thing. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8422.699999999999s)]
*  It's just, it's like nightmare fuel breaking your shin like that. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8423.699999999999s)]
*  Very scary. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8427.58s)]
*  And as a fighter you have nightmares about that. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8428.58s)]
*  The first time that happened in the UFC was Corey Hill. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8432.06s)]
*  And I remember screaming at the referee stop the fight. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8434.46s)]
*  Because the referee, I don't think he recognized it yet. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8438.939999999999s)]
*  He recognized it eventually. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8441.619999999999s)]
*  Didn't he step back on it too? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8443.38s)]
*  That's the worst they always do. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8444.859999999999s)]
*  Because it's your instinct. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8446.9s)]
*  You don't even know it. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8448.34s)]
*  Smack. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8449.34s)]
*  Well you don't know it's broken yet. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8450.34s)]
*  You just know it hurts. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8451.34s)]
*  I mean how many times does it hurt and not break? [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8452.34s)]
*  That's the thing about shins. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8454.38s)]
*  I'm surprised it hasn't popped. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8457.14s)]
*  They haven't had any crazy, what is it called when it pops through the skin? [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8459.14s)]
*  Compound fractures. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8463.1s)]
*  I'm surprised we haven't seen that. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8464.1s)]
*  That's Weidman it did. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8465.1s)]
*  Weidman did, yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8466.1s)]
*  Weidman's popped out the back of his leg. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8467.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8469.1s)]
*  Popped out the back of his calf. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8470.1s)]
*  I mean Chris has been, how many years out now? [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8471.1s)]
*  Is it two? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8473.94s)]

*  Chris Weidman, that's another guy man. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8502.06s)]
*  When he was in his prime he was such a motherfucker dude. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8503.98s)]
*  I mean to take out. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8507.06s)]
*  Everybody. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8509.099999999999s)]
*  When he beat Silva though, that was when we were all like, man nobody's going to beat [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8510.38s)]
*  this guy. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8515.22s)]
*  Right. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8516.22s)]
*  Can't beat this guy. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8517.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8518.22s)]
*  Can't beat this guy. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8519.22s)]
*  And he was beating Luke Rockhold and he throws a wheel kick. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8520.22s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8522.14s)]
*  That one kick, which by the way, not a good kick either. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8523.58s)]
*  He's not good at it. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8526.42s)]
*  It's not his thing. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8527.42s)]
*  You're a wrestler Chris. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8528.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8529.42s)]
*  I mean why did he decide to do that? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8530.42s)]
*  And then he gets taken down and smacked. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8531.58s)]
*  And Luke Rockhold's top came. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8533.539999999999s)]
*  Crushed him. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8536.38s)]
*  Oh his top came is fucking nasty. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8537.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8539.62s)]
*  What he did to Liotta Machida. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8540.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8541.62s)]
*  I was in the stands for that one. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8542.62s)]
*  I was watching that one. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8543.9s)]
*  Look, Chris Weidman was a bad motherfucker. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8545.3s)]
*  Chris Weidman was such a bad motherfucker. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8548.22s)]
*  That was so bad. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8552.3s)]
*  So bad. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8553.78s)]
*  And then he gets wrestled down. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8554.82s)]
*  He gets taken down and just destroyed. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8556.8s)]
*  I mean it's such a bad kick. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8559.02s)]
*  And Luke Rockhold, when he gets on top of you, he's one of the worst guys to ever have [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8561.46s)]
*  on top of you. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8565.76s)]
*  David Branch fight when he got on top of him and smashed him. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8567.08s)]
*  I mean Luke was so fucking good at top game. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8569.64s)]
*  His fucking Jiu Jitsu is so underrated. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8574.0s)]
*  I mean I don't even say it's underrated. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8576.28s)]
*  Yeah he's good. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8579.04s)]
*  I mean if he had just completely concentrated only on Jiu Jitsu, I think Luke could have [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8580.04s)]
*  been a world class Jiu Jitsu competitor. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8585.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8586.72s)]
*  He's so fucking strong. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8587.72s)]
*  And he came up with that camp with DC, and Cain Velasquez. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8588.72s)]
*  So he's like in there with these elite heavyweight wrestlers all the time. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8592.16s)]
*  He just loves that left kick as well. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8596.56s)]
*  Isn't it crazy though that one fight like that with Wideman just changes the trajectory [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8598.52s)]
*  of his career? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8602.8s)]
*  Before that he's this destroyer. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8603.8s)]
*  The Leoto Machida fight I said. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8605.36s)]
*  Remember that fight? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8607.68s)]
*  He gets Leoto down and just smashes him. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8608.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8611.72s)]
*  And you're like Jesus Christ. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8612.72s)]
*  Chris was so mentally tough and so fucking good at everything. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8615.32s)]
*  Great striker, great wrestling, tough as fucking nails. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8620.039999999999s)]
*  It's almost like you get this one moment where things don't go right and then you can't, [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8623.44s)]
*  I don't know if it's the competition around you sees a weakness in you and then they aren't [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8630.0s)]
*  as intimidated by you and then starts to, but I think it also is just this game is so [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8634.84s)]
*  young and people are getting so good so fucking fast man. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8644.24s)]
*  Like nowadays these kids, it's unbelievable how good they are. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8649.72s)]
*  Look at this Raul Rosas Jr. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8655.439999999999s)]
*  19 years old? [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8656.439999999999s)]
*  He's not even. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8657.439999999999s)]
*  He's 18. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8658.439999999999s)]
*  18 years old fighting in the UFC. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8659.439999999999s)]
*  He's got a good fight too. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8661.439999999999s)]
*  He's fighting Christian Rodriguez who I trained with at Rufusport for years. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8663.119999999999s)]
*  Very good fight. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8668.08s)]
*  That's going to be a good fight. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8669.08s)]
*  Very good fight. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8670.08s)]
*  That kid is, he had a little stumble on the Contenders Series where he didn't make weight, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8671.08s)]
*  didn't get signed on that and then he lost his debut up at 45 to Jonathan Pierce, right? [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8674.96s)]
*  Jonathan, JSP. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8681.279999999999s)]
*  But his last fight he looked unbelievable. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8685.16s)]
*  The kid can grapple. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8686.759999999998s)]
*  The kid's got unbelievable kickboxing. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8687.759999999998s)]
*  I think he's training with Henry Souto on those guys now out in Arizona. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8690.08s)]
*  When you're that good at 18, they're throwing you right to the wolves. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8693.4s)]
*  It's just like what the sky's the limit for these guys and then there's a bunch of guys [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8697.24s)]
*  like that out there that are fighting in LFA, that are fighting in this organization. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8702.32s)]
*  Just going to these gyms, going to these mega gyms and just if you watch or practice, the [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8706.039999999999s)]
*  mats are filled with these, you're like beating up some UFC pros and stuff and nobody knows [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8711.119999999999s)]
*  who they are yet because they've grown up. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8716.32s)]
*  That's all they know. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8720.08s)]
*  They don't know, oh yeah, I did taekwondo as a kid and then I did some boxing and then [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8721.08s)]
*  I did X, Y, and Z. It's like no, I do MMA. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8725.279999999999s)]
*  And they get to watch all the best fighters ever. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8727.44s)]
*  If you go back to the early days of the UFC, what are they basing their style on? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8731.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8735.08s)]
*  Figuring it out. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8736.08s)]
*  Yeah, they were figuring it out as they went along. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8737.08s)]
*  It's also a thing with fighters where when you were operating at fucking redlining at [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8739.48s)]
*  this, you only have a certain amount of years. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8744.84s)]
*  I think there's a principle that a lot of people try to apply. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8747.92s)]
*  I don't think it's universal, but it's a nine-year thing that as an elite MMA fighter, you really [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8750.92s)]
*  only have nine years. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8757.16s)]
*  Nine years where you're just at the top and then eventually, like Tony Ferguson we were [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8759.48s)]
*  talking about or Fador. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8764.56s)]
*  Fador is another great example of that. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8765.56s)]
*  Yeah, where you're the goat. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8767.4s)]
*  You're one of the greatest heavyweights and then it's just like you're getting beat up. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8769.199999999999s)]
*  I feel like if you go back to those days, the early days of Pride, the Fador that was [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8774.0s)]
*  dominating people in Pride was one of the most impressive fighters that has ever fucking [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8779.64s)]
*  lived. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8784.76s)]
*  God damn, he could do it all. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8785.76s)]
*  He could catch you with arm bars off of his back. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8787.480000000001s)]
*  He would recover from being taken down and immediately roll into a kimura like the Randleman [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8790.16s)]
*  fight. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8794.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, get smashed on his neck. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8795.560000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8796.560000000001s)]
*  Looked like the person should be dead. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8797.560000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8800.800000000001s)]
*  Should be looking at a dead body and then arm bar. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8801.800000000001s)]
*  You know, again, it's like you only have so many years that you can operate at that level. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8804.04s)]
*  How many training camps can you get through? [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8808.6s)]
*  How many times can your body take that kind of punishment? [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8811.08s)]
*  That's where you got to get out. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8813.28s)]
*  You got to get out even when maybe you think, oh, I got a few more fights. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8814.42s)]
*  There's no doubt in my mind I have five more fights that I could have done. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8820.18s)]
*  How old are you now? [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8825.06s)]
*  38? [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8826.06s)]
*  38. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8827.06s)]
*  So you still, it seems like the back of your fucking head. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8828.06s)]
*  Ow. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8831.02s)]
*  A little bit of an ember back there. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8832.02s)]
*  No, I mean, it's always going to be there. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8834.62s)]
*  Listen, I'm trying to start an acting career. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8838.42s)]
*  I'm trying to do a triathlon career. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8840.82s)]
*  I'm trying to be a commentator. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8842.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8844.18s)]
*  I got to, you know what? [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8845.18s)]
*  I'm lucky though, man, because you can see why guys overstay their welcome. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8847.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8853.78s)]
*  You got to make money. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8854.78s)]
*  It's your job. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8855.78s)]
*  Yes. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8856.78s)]
*  You didn't know anything else anymore. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8857.78s)]
*  And then suddenly everybody's like, retire. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8859.38s)]
*  And it's like, screw you. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8861.5s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8863.22s)]
*  I'm 38. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8864.22s)]
*  I'm 37 or 40. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8865.22s)]
*  It's like, what do you mean, retire? [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8866.22s)]
*  What am I going to do now? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8869.22s)]
*  So you see why guys have to fight past that. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8870.86s)]
*  I was super, super lucky and blessed to get the commentary job where I can think, okay, [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8873.34s)]
*  do I want to keep fighting? [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8880.980000000001s)]
*  Why am I still fighting? [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8882.720000000001s)]
*  And I just didn't see a picture for the belt anymore. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8884.480000000001s)]
*  And if I don't see a picture for the belt, I always told everyone around me, my mom, [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8886.74s)]
*  my loved ones, I said, if I don't think that I can fight and win the championship, I'll [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8890.900000000001s)]
*  retire. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8895.300000000001s)]
*  And that day came. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8896.300000000001s)]
*  I remember one of those fights where guys take that one too many fights and it's just [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8897.74s)]
*  like you see it come. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8901.259999999998s)]
*  And like with Frankie, it was Chris Gutierrez. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8902.259999999998s)]
*  I was like, Chris Gutierrez is so slick. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8904.38s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8908.14s)]
*  I didn't like that fight from the first time I heard it. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8909.14s)]
*  I did not like that fight. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8910.14s)]
*  I love watching Chris fight. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8911.14s)]
*  Chris is so fucking smooth and technical. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8913.019999999999s)]
*  I just love his style, man. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8916.3s)]
*  He's good. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8918.38s)]
*  His movement and style and all the jukes and fakes. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8919.38s)]
*  And you're talking about a guy who has unbelievable knees. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8924.060000000001s)]
*  And that's been in his career. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8927.9s)]
*  And you match him up with Frankie. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8930.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8931.62s)]
*  And he catches him with the perfect knee and flat lines with his kids in the audience. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8932.62s)]
*  And that's the other thing. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8938.02s)]
*  A lot of people are like, why don't you come back and do a retirement fight? [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8939.02s)]
*  I'm like, why so I can get knocked out in front of everybody? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8942.02s)]
*  No, I like what you're doing. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8944.62s)]
*  I like that you found a new thing to do. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8946.42s)]
*  Never been knocked out. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8948.42s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8949.42s)]
*  Never been knocked out. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8950.42s)]
*  You got a fucking amazing chin. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8951.42s)]
*  The only stoppage was due to the cut. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8952.86s)]
*  It's the only time I've been... [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8955.66s)]
*  What fight was that? [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8957.66s)]
*  Trinaldo. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8958.66s)]
*  Peeled my whole face off. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8959.66s)]
*  You could see the whole eyebrow. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8962.62s)]
*  Yeah, the skull. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8963.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's an amazing accomplishment to fight the guys that you fought. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8965.62s)]
*  I fought Edson Barboza twice. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8970.78s)]
*  Barboza's switch kick to this day, when he was in his prime, Barboza had the craziest [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8973.380000000001s)]
*  switch kick I think I've ever seen in my life. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8977.62s)]
*  It would be like you're watching a video and frames were removed or something. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8979.86s)]
*  Yeah, like how is he that fast? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8983.38s)]
*  And that's exactly how it feels when you're fighting. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8984.86s)]
*  Move along. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8987.82s)]
*  But it was interesting that his hands never really matched the level of his kicks. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8989.74s)]
*  No. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8995.94s)]
*  Really wild, right? [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8996.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he punched me a couple of times. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=8997.94s)]
*  I mean, as square on the jaw as you can hit somebody, it's like... [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9002.1s)]
*  I was never worried about his punches. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9006.02s)]
*  It was just his kicks and his knees. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9008.38s)]
*  Even against the fence, if you're grappling for position and he just kind of dig a few [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9011.98s)]
*  in, you're like, oh, fuck. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9016.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9018.3s)]
*  Well, that was one of the times when I knew how special Khabib truly was, was when Khabib [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9019.3s)]
*  got a hold of him and you saw this look on Edson's face, like this thousand yard stare. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9024.259999999998s)]
*  Like what the fuck? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9028.779999999999s)]
*  I thought the same thing. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9030.339999999998s)]
*  That's when I was like, okay. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9031.779999999999s)]
*  I tried to do that and that ain't easy to do to that guy. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9034.980000000001s)]
*  And I've trained with Edson after the fact that I fought him the first time. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9038.460000000001s)]
*  And he's not an easy guy to like hold down. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9042.42s)]
*  He's strong as shit. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9044.62s)]
*  And then you see Khabib's just like... [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9047.34s)]
*  Boom. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9049.300000000001s)]
*  Just sitting there smashing him. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9050.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, just smashing him. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9052.140000000001s)]
*  Just had so much control and power. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9053.140000000001s)]
*  What do you think happens to John Jones? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9055.140000000001s)]
*  When John Jones gets up to heavyweight, we've never seen him fight... [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9057.140000000001s)]
*  I've heard all the training room stories about him ragdolling heavyweights. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9060.86s)]
*  John at heavyweight is going to be even better because he's not diminished by making that [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9065.5s)]
*  cut to 205. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9068.82s)]
*  And John's always... [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9069.82s)]
*  I mean, he definitely has a frame for a heavyweight and he looks good now. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9070.82s)]
*  He's 254, 253, big as fuck. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9074.66s)]
*  I'm excited about it because towards the end of his light heavyweight reign, he's kind [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9078.619999999999s)]
*  of playing with his food a little bit out there, right? [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9085.1s)]
*  Had that fight where a lot of people think he lost. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9087.78s)]
*  But really, I think a lot of it was just him being lazy, to be honest with you. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9091.78s)]
*  Now at heavyweight, I think we're going to see him come out and try to make some freaking [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9095.62s)]
*  statements. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9101.78s)]
*  Well, it's also he has been out for all these years. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9102.78s)]
*  He's been how many years now? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9105.54s)]
*  It's been two plus years since he's fought. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9106.54s)]
*  And you wonder, does he have ring rust? [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9109.740000000002s)]
*  Does he come back hungrier? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9114.980000000001s)]
*  I definitely don't think he has ring rust. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9117.26s)]
*  But he's dealing with the most mobile and agile heavyweight in the business. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9119.06s)]
*  Three years. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9124.34s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9125.34s)]
*  February 2020. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9126.34s)]
*  Wow. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9127.34s)]
*  And the Dominic Reyes fight, the last fight that he had, arguably lost that decision. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9128.34s)]
*  I mean, many people. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9132.46s)]
*  In the moment, I thought he lost it. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9134.46s)]
*  John is famous for doing just enough in training and with some of those guys. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9137.859999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9142.539999999999s)]
*  I think at heavyweight, hopefully... [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9143.539999999999s)]
*  Well, he's training with Sohudo, which I really like. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9145.86s)]
*  At least he's doing some of his camp with Sohudo, which I really... [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9148.380000000001s)]
*  Henry Sohudo is a goddamn genius. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9151.02s)]
*  He is a fight genius. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9153.34s)]
*  Well, I mean, you got a guy who Olympic champion, then double champion. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9154.34s)]
*  Clearly the man understands combat sports on another level. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9160.78s)]
*  He knows how to win. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9164.060000000001s)]
*  And he knows how to win. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9165.060000000001s)]
*  And Mighty Mouse told me when he went to train with him, he said he was so impressed by how [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9166.060000000001s)]
*  systematic he was and the game plan and strategy and how he puts everything together. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9169.140000000001s)]
*  I've never seen anybody that's so meticulous in their preparation. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9175.3s)]
*  Yeah, and you see that even in the fighters that he's training now. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9178.26s)]
*  And that's why I'm excited to see him come back. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9181.46s)]
*  I mean, put all the cringe stuff and all that, whatever. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9183.3s)]
*  That's kind of funny. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9185.82s)]
*  Right? [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9186.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's his whole thing. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9187.82s)]
*  But his skills? [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9189.02s)]
*  Oh, undeniable. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9191.66s)]
*  Undeniable. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9192.66s)]
*  I mean, the way he chopped down Dominic Cruz, I was like, oh my God. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9193.66s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9196.98s)]
*  The way he beat the fucking brakes off of TJ Dillashaw. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9197.98s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9200.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9201.42s)]
*  I mean, he's a monster. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9202.42s)]
*  And the fact that he comes back from Mighty Mouse beating him in the first fight quick, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9204.14s)]
*  stopping him early with knees to the body. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9208.02s)]
*  And then comes back and beats him in the second fight after getting his calf kicked out from [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9210.779999999999s)]
*  under him. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9214.26s)]
*  Remember? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9215.26s)]
*  He got that drop foot. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9216.26s)]
*  That was one of the first times where we saw that. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9217.26s)]
*  I was like, what the hell is that? [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9218.66s)]
*  Looks like his ankle's broken. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9219.98s)]
*  And then he came back and won the decision. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9221.46s)]
*  He knows how to win. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9224.939999999999s)]
*  I love him and Algermain. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9226.539999999999s)]
*  That is a very fascinating fight because Algermain's strength is his grappling. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9228.06s)]
*  Algermain, when he gets your back, dude, there's not a better fucking person in any division. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9232.94s)]
*  Algermain, that backpack, woo. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9236.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9238.26s)]
*  And the way he looked against TJ, he looked against TJ like, obviously, TJ had a fucked [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9239.26s)]
*  up shoulder in that fight. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9243.140000000001s)]
*  But Algermain looked like a dominant champion. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9244.58s)]
*  He looked like he's coming into his own. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9247.58s)]
*  I mean, he's the perfect Bill for 35. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9249.060000000001s)]
*  Fucking shredded. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9251.900000000001s)]
*  Shredded at 35. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9253.900000000001s)]
*  So muscular and strong and so fucking, so talented. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9255.34s)]
*  And also just confident. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9258.980000000001s)]
*  Everything's together. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9260.34s)]
*  And from a distance, which is he's so good with his kicks, right? [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9261.82s)]
*  And that's something he works on constantly. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9265.98s)]
*  Because when you think about it, if you're a really strong grappler and you're a guy [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9267.82s)]
*  who you wanted to get to the ground, you've got a great wrestling base, why wouldn't you [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9271.98s)]
*  work on having those kind of weapons, those long range weapons? [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9276.22s)]
*  Come on. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9280.3s)]
*  You try to close the distance on me. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9281.3s)]
*  Because if you don't, I'm just going to sit out here and I'm going to kick the shit out [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9283.74s)]
*  of you literally with my kicks. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9286.22s)]
*  Front kick the fuck out of your body. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9287.9s)]
*  I'm going to front kick you. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9288.9s)]
*  I'm going to roundhouse kick you. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9289.9s)]
*  I'm going to learn some spinning kicks. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9291.46s)]
*  He was working. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9292.46s)]
*  I saw him doing a little bit of traditional martial arts at the apex. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9293.46s)]
*  But that's genius. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9296.42s)]
*  Because you're forcing your opponents to have to close the distance. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9298.02s)]
*  And you're a freaking wrestler. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9302.06s)]
*  Well, Cowboy was always so good at that. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9303.3s)]
*  Cowboy would throw high kicks because his guard was so good. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9305.5s)]
*  People forget in the early days of Cowboy's career. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9308.1s)]
*  He was trying to get the fuck out of people. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9311.3s)]
*  Cowboy's grappling is so underappreciated. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9313.779999999999s)]
*  The amount of times that I have been choked by Donald Cerrone. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9317.18s)]
*  Those legs. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9322.18s)]
*  I hate him. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9323.18s)]
*  And you go at his ranch and he's up at freaking elevation in Edgewood, New Mexico. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9324.18s)]
*  So you're training at like 7,500 feet above sea level coming from Philly. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9328.06s)]
*  And then this dude's wrapping triangles and body triangles around you and just talking [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9332.62s)]
*  shit to you the whole time. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9336.460000000001s)]
*  You're like, God damn, I hate him. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9337.78s)]
*  Is it the size of him now? [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9340.58s)]
*  He's f**king in the heavyweight now. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9341.94s)]
*  He's so big. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9344.460000000001s)]
*  I was like, do you even lift, dude? [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9345.5s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9347.5s)]
*  He commented all my shit. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9348.939999999999s)]
*  He's like, nope, no, that's where we're different. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9350.419999999998s)]
*  I ain't doing any of that shit. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9353.019999999999s)]
*  He's not lifting? [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9354.3s)]
*  No, of course he's. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9355.3s)]
*  Yeah, he's definitely lifting. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9356.3s)]
*  That's why I made a joke. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9357.3s)]
*  He's gigantic now. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9358.58s)]
*  He's got to be 200 pounds now. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9360.699999999999s)]
*  He's f**king gigantic. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9362.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9363.22s)]
*  That photo of him was wearing a tank top and you look at his arms. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9364.22s)]
*  And he was never like that. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9368.14s)]
*  He couldn't gain weight to save his life back in the day. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9370.38s)]
*  Now you get older, man. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9374.1s)]
*  Mexican supplements, bro. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9375.42s)]
*  And some proper beef. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9376.62s)]
*  Look at the f**king neck on him. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9378.62s)]
*  Look at his neck. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9380.58s)]
*  That's preposterous. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9381.9s)]
*  Coach Ray. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9382.94s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9384.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9385.5s)]
*  It's an interesting time, man. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9387.26s)]
*  It's an interesting time to be a commentator. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9388.5s)]
*  It's an interesting time to be a fan. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9390.26s)]
*  You know, there's so much talent and so much going on. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9392.02s)]
*  And this is the only sport, really, in our lifetime where [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9394.460000000001s)]
*  you can go back 20 years and it's almost unrecognizable. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9397.94s)]
*  The difference in the talent level between 2000 and 2023 is so extreme. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9402.54s)]
*  It's so different to watch how good guys have gotten. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9408.98s)]
*  Everywhere. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9413.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9414.1s)]
*  They're good everywhere. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9415.1s)]
*  Everywhere. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9416.1s)]
*  From the jump. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9417.1s)]
*  These kids can do a flying knee, a flying triangle, and then hit you with just a beautiful [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9418.1s)]
*  double leg and transition seamlessly in their wrestling. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9421.66s)]
*  And they know how to do it on the fence. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9426.06s)]
*  They know how to... [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9427.78s)]
*  And then, you know... [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9429.7s)]
*  I hate it. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9430.7s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9432.1s)]
*  It's really... [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9433.1s)]
*  And you've got to wonder, like, what are we looking at 10 years from now? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9434.1s)]
*  When you've got these Bon Fim dudes coming in that are, you know, one fight in the UFC [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9438.1s)]
*  and he looks like a world champion. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9442.54s)]
*  It's going to be... [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9444.5s)]
*  You're going to see some crazy good fights and some crazy finishes, man. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9445.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9450.94s)]
*  I think... [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9451.94s)]
*  Because as long as the competition keeps getting up like that, you know, I mean, sometimes [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9452.94s)]
*  you're going to catch... [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9456.980000000001s)]
*  But like McKinney, to do that... [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9458.54s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9460.54s)]
*  And do that to McKinney. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9462.380000000001s)]
*  And to catch him like that. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9463.380000000001s)]
*  And, you know, McKinney, to his credit, like, what a class act he is. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9464.380000000001s)]
*  Like after the fight... [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9468.18s)]
*  Having shots with him. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9469.18s)]
*  ...did shots with him and then posts it, you know, and posts a photo of the two of them [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9470.18s)]
*  together. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9473.820000000002s)]
*  Good for him. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9474.820000000002s)]
*  He's such a great character. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9475.820000000002s)]
*  He's a good kid. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9477.060000000001s)]
*  He's just... [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9478.060000000001s)]
*  He's so young. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9479.060000000001s)]

*  Valentina Shevchenko versus Alexa Grosso. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9506.02s)]

*  Jalen Turner, and he as big as you can get at 155. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9518.1s)]
*  Yeah, he's like 6'4", I think. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9522.1s)]

*  Is that a debut? [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9537.7s)]
*  No, no. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9538.7s)]
*  He's had a few fights. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9539.7s)]
*  I haven't seen... [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9540.7s)]
*  I don't think I've commented on his fights. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9541.7s)]
*  I've seen him. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9542.7s)]
*  I think I called one of his fights. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9543.7s)]
*  Ian Gary's a bad motherfucker, too. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9544.86s)]
*  And you know what? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9545.86s)]
*  Ian had that one standout knockout, but I feel like his ceiling still hasn't been reached. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9546.86s)]
*  He hasn't really shown what he's going to do in the UFC yet. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9551.86s)]
*  No, I don't think so, either. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9556.86s)]
*  I still think he's got a lot to show, in a good way. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9557.86s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9559.86s)]
*  Well, he's so young. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9560.86s)]
*  How old is Ian Gary? [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9561.86s)]
*  He's got to be in his mid-20s. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9562.86s)]
*  He's young as fuck, man. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9563.86s)]
*  He's got massive, massive potential. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9564.86s)]
*  25 years old. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9567.86s)]
*  25 years old. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9568.86s)]

*  25 years old. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9570.86s)]
*  25 years old. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9571.86s)]

*  25 years old. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9574.02s)]
*  25. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9575.02s)]
*  Woo! [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9576.02s)]
*  Yeah, and tall, too, for the weight class. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9577.02s)]
*  Tall and slick. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9578.82s)]
*  And Cody Garbrandt versus Julio Arce. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9579.82s)]
*  I think that might have changed. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9583.5s)]
*  I think Julio is out. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9585.140000000001s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9586.58s)]
*  I mean, it's not changed on there yet, but I think I just saw a post saying that he was [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9587.58s)]
*  out of that fight. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9591.300000000001s)]
*  I don't know who Cody's going to fight, but... [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9592.300000000001s)]
*  Tough road for Cody. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9594.78s)]
*  There's another one, man. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9595.78s)]
*  Yeah, another guy. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9596.78s)]
*  Just like, oh my god. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9597.78s)]
*  The leader of the elite at one point in time. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9598.78s)]
*  And then just a couple... [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9599.78s)]
*  And I know Cody's had trouble with... [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9603.34s)]
*  I think he was knocked out really bad when he was young and up and coming, too. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9605.460000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9609.9s)]
*  Someone KO'd him very early on in his career. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9610.9s)]
*  Real bad. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9613.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9614.26s)]
*  And so Arce injured, bounced from Cody Garbrandt fight. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9615.26s)]
*  Well, still enough time. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9618.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9620.34s)]
*  There's tons of... [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9621.34s)]
*  Oh, that's a sad... [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9622.34s)]
*  That's a bummer. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9623.34s)]
*  That's a bad one. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9624.34s)]
*  So who do they get? [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9625.98s)]
*  No word. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9626.98s)]
*  No word. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9627.98s)]
*  No word. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9628.98s)]
*  Were the promotion plans to keep Garbrandt on the fight card? [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9629.98s)]
*  With Cody Garbrandt, after all those KO's, you got to wonder how many more does he have [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9633.699999999999s)]
*  left? [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9636.699999999999s)]
*  When a guy gets KO'd a gang of times, there's a lot of people that it gets to a certain [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9637.699999999999s)]
*  point in time, you're like, someone needs to step in and stop this from happening. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9644.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9648.699999999999s)]
*  It was like four in a row or something for him. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9649.699999999999s)]
*  You're a young guy. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9653.02s)]
*  This sport's rough on our heads to begin with. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9657.859999999999s)]
*  When you've been put out that many, that's when you really got to think, hey, maybe it's [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9661.46s)]
*  time. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9667.22s)]
*  I mean, if he goes and gets on another win streak, but... [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9668.22s)]
*  Well, Suhasana Malley was talking about this. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9670.38s)]
*  What's that gentleman he works with, Dan Gardner? [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9674.019999999999s)]
*  They're working on a concussion protocol to rehabilitate people from concussions and that [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9677.06s)]
*  there's things you can do to help yourself recover and heal. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9683.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9687.3s)]
*  It's got to be something with the fluids and what causes some people to have brain [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9688.3s)]
*  damage and other people don't. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9699.099999999999s)]
*  That's the real issue too is I've talked to the doctors at the Cleveland Clinic. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9700.42s)]
*  I've been part of a study that they offer everybody in the UFC and a lot of NFL guys [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9706.98s)]
*  and all that, that every year you go back and you do the same series of tests and they [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9711.42s)]
*  run the same exact scans. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9715.779999999999s)]
*  I was having some headaches when I fought twice in a row. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9718.66s)]
*  I fought Ross right after I fought Edson the first time. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9722.22s)]
*  For like a month I had a headache and I was like, this is not normal. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9727.38s)]
*  It turns out I just had a really bad concussion. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9730.859999999999s)]
*  I wasn't knocked out, but it doesn't mean you don't have a concussion. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9733.06s)]
*  I was having all these symptoms. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9736.26s)]
*  I went and had all that testing done. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9738.3s)]
*  Just recently last year I went back and it's amazing. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9741.3s)]
*  I aced everything that I failed the first time I had went. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9744.54s)]
*  My scans all came back clear and I was talking to the doctor and I was like, some of these [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9750.380000000001s)]
*  guys will fight only a few times and have severe brain damage and all this kind of stuff. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9753.94s)]
*  Why am I showing no signs of any of that? [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9758.460000000001s)]
*  A lot of it's genetic. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9762.820000000002s)]
*  Look at Mark Hunt. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9763.820000000002s)]
*  Mark Hunt, he jokes around about it. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9766.380000000001s)]
*  He's like, mate, I'm Polynesian. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9768.78s)]
*  I can fucking take it. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9770.78s)]
*  It's true. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9772.54s)]
*  Did you see Mark Hunt knock that fucking undefeated boxer out? [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9773.54s)]
*  Did you see that? [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9777.18s)]
*  No. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9778.18s)]
*  Bro. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9779.18s)]
*  Pull that up. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9780.18s)]
*  Mark Hunt, they bring him in. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9781.18s)]
*  He fights his cat in Australia. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9782.460000000001s)]
*  This guy is this undefeated up and coming heavyweight boxer. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9784.740000000002s)]
*  Young, good looking guy. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=9787.94s)]

*  But he's 41 in, you know, Vali Tuto years. [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10072.800000000001s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10077.04s)]
*  Just think just think about the fights in the gym. [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10078.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10081.28s)]
*  That that guy went through. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10082.28s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10083.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10084.28s)]
*  Those old days with the shoot the box Academy, they would go to war. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10085.880000000001s)]
*  They were trying to knock each other out every day. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10089.08s)]
*  Every day. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10091.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10092.68s)]
*  And that's not good for longevity of the career. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10093.68s)]
*  No, no. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10096.12s)]
*  But I mean, that's even when I was coming up, there were still a lot of that going on, [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10097.12s)]
*  man. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10102.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10103.84s)]
*  You know, guys just I would get into fistfights in the gym. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10104.84s)]
*  We were just trying to knock each other out. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10106.68s)]
*  I look back. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10108.36s)]
*  I'm like, so stupid. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10109.36s)]
*  So stupid. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10110.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10111.92s)]
*  I mean, what do you think is the balance, though? [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10113.56s)]
*  Because I think there has to be some hard sparring just to prepare you. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10115.36s)]
*  100%. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10119.16s)]
*  So I think you have to pick moments to do it. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10120.16s)]
*  And I think you have to kind of really have that be the day that you're doing those rounds, [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10124.24s)]
*  right? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10130.48s)]
*  And also have people that you're sparring with that are kind of trying to simulate the [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10131.48s)]
*  fight. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10136.28s)]
*  Whereas if you're just going around the room and sparring everybody in the room that day, [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10137.28s)]
*  like most gyms do now, where it's like you just, oh, let me grab this partner. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10141.72s)]
*  Let me grab that partner. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10144.599999999999s)]
*  You're not getting the look for your fight. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10146.039999999999s)]
*  You're getting pissed off. [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10147.4s)]
*  Somebody hits you with something. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10148.56s)]
*  You end up going to battle with them. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10149.56s)]
*  Whereas if it's more secured, kind of like how pro boxers do everything where you have [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10150.72s)]
*  your sparring partners, that day is set up, you're greased up, you have somebody in the [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10155.4s)]
*  ring. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10159.279999999999s)]
*  I think it needs to be very formalized like that when you're going to have your hard days [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10160.279999999999s)]
*  so that you're not just off in the corner getting into a slugfest with some dude that's [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10163.439999999999s)]
*  having a dick measuring contest with you, basically. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10168.48s)]
*  That's the hard conversation too about what kind of camp do you go to? [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10172.0s)]
*  If you're an up and coming fighter, do you go to ATT where you've got like 15 dudes who [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10176.6s)]
*  just flew in from Russia and they're staying in the dorms and they're fucking assassins? [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10181.08s)]
*  You get spinning back fisted to death. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10185.16s)]
*  Or do you start out a small gym? [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10188.08s)]
*  I had this conversation with Joaquin Buckley where he's talking about he likes smaller [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10189.880000000001s)]
*  gyms because he gets individualized training and he gets a coach who's really looking [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10192.94s)]
*  at his development. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10196.92s)]
*  Setting up his camp, like you're going to spar with this guy because this guy's going [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10198.84s)]
*  to emulate this for you. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10202.24s)]
*  Yeah, and we're even going to bring in guys because there's not enough guys here and you're [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10203.24s)]
*  probably the best guy in the room. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10207.52s)]
*  I think that is the way to go and I think being able to bring people in to work with [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10210.800000000001s)]
*  you as well and keep a good relationship with other fighters and other camps to kind of [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10216.04s)]
*  share sparring partners and bringing people in so that you need to get the look that you [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10220.2s)]
*  want for that fight. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10226.720000000001s)]
*  In hindsight, that's so overlooked I think. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10228.599999999999s)]
*  You just fight anybody and it's like, well, on the day somebody can get hurt, you might [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10232.279999999999s)]
*  be stepping in. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10236.8s)]
*  It's like, yeah, but... [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10237.8s)]
*  Is that optimal though? [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10238.8s)]
*  Sometimes it is because sometimes that makes your career. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10240.84s)]
*  Sometimes you get that last minute fight, you step up, you win the fight and then it [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10243.4s)]
*  rockets your career forward. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10248.56s)]
*  You take that chance. [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10250.56s)]
*  You have that... [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10251.56s)]
*  I mean, Jamal Hill? [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10252.56s)]
*  That five round fight. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10254.88s)]
*  You're waiting for the title. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10257.12s)]
*  All of a sudden. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10258.12s)]
*  You definitely have to be ready. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10259.12s)]
*  What a crazy move the UFC does, right? [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10260.12s)]
*  Anko Lya and Vim Bojovic have this fight, goes to a draw, which is just unheard of, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10261.76s)]
*  right? [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10266.48s)]
*  Everyone's like, what? [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10267.48s)]
*  And then Danny gets pissed, fuck it. [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10268.48s)]
*  You guys are going to fight for the title now. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10270.56s)]
*  You're both out. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10271.960000000001s)]
*  And like, what? [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10272.960000000001s)]
*  Now Glover and him are fighting in Brazil for the title. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10273.960000000001s)]
*  But what a great fight, man. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10276.72s)]
*  What an amazing fight. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10277.960000000001s)]
*  And for Jamal, that's the perfect opportunity. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10279.24s)]
*  What an opportunity. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10282.04s)]
*  He goes in there and fights in Glover's hometown and wins the title. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10283.36s)]
*  And Anthony Smith gets kind of cast to the side. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10288.800000000001s)]
*  Well, Anthony didn't make weight either, which is worse because Anthony was the substitute. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10294.44s)]
*  Yeah, he was talking to me too. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10299.6s)]
*  And he really felt like it was going to plan. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10301.16s)]
*  But there's no motivation, man. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10305.960000000001s)]
*  That's where those things are tricky too, right? [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10307.52s)]
*  It's like, what are you pushing yourself in that sauna for? [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10309.16s)]
*  It's like, you know you're not fighting. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10313.36s)]
*  Glover's never going to fall out of a fight. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10315.039999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10317.92s)]
*  And Jamal's not exactly a... [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10318.92s)]
*  Jamal's not going to fall out of a fight either. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10319.92s)]
*  Yes, it's his opportunity right now. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10320.92s)]
*  And he was dialed in the whole week. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10322.36s)]
*  And Anthony knows that. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10324.16s)]
*  So I feel like it was just a little bit of lack of motivation, unfortunately. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10325.92s)]
*  Although it's free money. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10329.48s)]
*  It's free money, but it's also like, god damn, man. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10331.72s)]
*  What a brutal thing to do to your body for no reason. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10334.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10338.12s)]
*  Does he get anything? [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10339.12s)]
*  But the day of the fight, the day of the weigh-ins rather, they should know. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10341.160000000002s)]
*  Like Jamal, he should know. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10346.160000000002s)]
*  I don't have to make the weight. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10348.160000000002s)]
*  Don't make the weight. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10349.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10350.52s)]
*  If you're going to be the... [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10351.52s)]
*  I mean, what's going to happen? [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10352.52s)]
*  What could happen between the weigh-in and the fight? [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10353.84s)]
*  It's so rare. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10356.28s)]
*  It would have to be a stomach issue, pretty much. [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10357.400000000001s)]
*  Or someone is so fucked up from the weight cut. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10360.08s)]
*  That they just don't come back. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10362.62s)]
*  And Glover, at this point in his career, is not that guy. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10365.36s)]
*  He's dialed in. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10368.12s)]
*  Jamal was dialed in. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10369.12s)]
*  Dialed in. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10370.12s)]
*  Yeah, Jamal doesn't lose a lot of weight either. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10371.12s)]
*  No. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10372.84s)]
*  Jamal's pretty light. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10373.84s)]
*  And he brought in Ian, and he had him cooking for him the whole day. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10374.84s)]
*  He was not going to miss weight. [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10379.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10380.720000000001s)]
*  He was not going to miss weight for that opportunity. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10381.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's hard. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10382.720000000001s)]
*  I've never been the backup for anything like that. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10383.720000000001s)]
*  I've never had to go through that. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10386.720000000001s)]
*  When did they start doing that? [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10387.92s)]
*  I'm trying to think... [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10390.6s)]
*  Fairly recently, right? [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10391.6s)]
*  Within the last five or six years. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10392.6s)]
*  I know when Habib and Tony... [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10394.32s)]
*  When that kept falling out, I think that's when they were like, you know what? [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10397.92s)]
*  We should probably start having some backups in these types of situations. [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10401.36s)]
*  And there's been another time where somebody missed really bad. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10405.64s)]
*  We were talking about how... [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10408.24s)]
*  Oh my God, I'm going to blank on his name. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10409.88s)]
*  What weight class? [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10416.039999999999s)]
*  Welterweight. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10417.039999999999s)]
*  Vicente Luque took a backup spot on super short notice. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10418.039999999999s)]
*  I think he missed about 12 pounds or something. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10423.2s)]
*  Oh God. [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10424.92s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10425.92s)]
*  Well, some of these guys are so fucking big. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10426.92s)]
*  They're so big, and it's a hard opportunity to turn down, right? [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10429.44s)]
*  It's like, hey, listen, you might fight, but chances are you're not. [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10432.92s)]
*  But we're going to pay you to fight. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10435.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, there's guys like Paheta that can't make weight unless you give him three [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10437.04s)]
*  months, which is so... [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10442.68s)]
*  And I think Vicente was probably in that department where it was like, I'm not going to make this [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10444.640000000001s)]
*  on... [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10448.880000000001s)]
*  I think it was super short notice that he took it. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10449.880000000001s)]
*  I could be also talking out of my ass right now. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10451.6s)]
*  Where Hamza was talking about he wants to fight Paheta, and Paheta was like, good, let's [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10453.36s)]
*  fight a light heavyweight in Brazil. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10457.44s)]
*  72 hours? [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10459.0s)]
*  Oh, 72 hours ago that he was in that position. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10460.0s)]
*  Didn't feel that. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10463.28s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10464.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10465.28s)]
*  Just Chelson explaining the backup fighter. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10466.28s)]
*  I was trying to find the history of it, and as you were talking about it, they were talking [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10469.28s)]
*  about Vicente Luque. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10473.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10474.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10475.28s)]
*  Vicente Luque, the backup fighter, coming in at 100. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10476.28s)]
*  Oh. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10480.32s)]
*  Who told me 12 pounds? [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10482.119999999999s)]
*  Maybe he had to lose 12 pounds in a day or something like that. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10484.6s)]
*  I'm going to have to find that source and get mad at him now. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10486.64s)]
*  What do you think of Kamaru Usman rematching Leon Edwards in London? [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10491.16s)]
*  I love that it's in London for Leon, but I just... [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10494.96s)]
*  Based on how that fight was going the first time, I think Kamaru's going to go in there [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10501.6s)]
*  and be much more dialed in and not allow a moment like that to happen again, and I think [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10507.64s)]
*  he's going to be able to pull it off and win. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10513.279999999999s)]
*  Well, it's hard to say, man, because when you watch a guy like Leon Edwards realize [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10515.84s)]
*  that he could KO Kamaru with one shot, and then he pulls it off and did it, and also [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10522.76s)]
*  took him down in the first round, now he's the champion. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10527.439999999999s)]
*  He's got that championship confidence, that championship rub. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10530.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10533.56s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10534.56s)]
*  And he's in London. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10535.56s)]
*  I think he's going to have a lot more confidence coming into this one, and the London crowd [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10536.72s)]
*  is a real thing. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10541.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10543.6s)]
*  The last few that I've worked there, man, they make Brazil seem quiet anymore. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10544.6s)]
*  That crowd there is just crazy. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10550.4s)]
*  And then you also have to realize that one of the beautiful things that Leon's done is [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10552.84s)]
*  he did it all from home. [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10556.6s)]
*  He really didn't join American Top Team or TriStar. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10559.359999999999s)]
*  He didn't join a big camp. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10562.56s)]
*  No, he tried, and he hated it. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10564.039999999999s)]
*  He didn't want to be away from home. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10565.960000000001s)]
*  We've talked to him a lot about this, and he realized that he can be at home, working [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10569.92s)]
*  with good wrestlers and doing all that kind of stuff, and focused on himself and not going [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10576.36s)]
*  away to America just to work his wrestling. [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10581.12s)]
*  He's like, how about you develop everything else and become a better fighter for the style [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10582.960000000001s)]
*  that you're going to bring to the table, as opposed to trying to put yourself into this [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10587.7s)]
*  American-style wrestling camp and just not working on yourself. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10591.64s)]
*  And you go to these big gyms, especially early on in his career, and you're just getting, [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10598.16s)]
*  OK, yeah, go over here and work with so-and-so. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10602.039999999999s)]
*  You're not getting that attention. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10605.32s)]
*  You stay back home in England, and you're the star pupil. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10606.32s)]
*  You got everybody working around you. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10609.68s)]
*  Yeah, the amount of hype that's going to be on that. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10611.039999999999s)]
*  And then there's the other thing with Camaro. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10612.92s)]
*  Camaro is famous for having knee problems. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10615.0s)]
*  He has horrendous knees. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10617.92s)]
*  Yeah, he can't even walk down steps, right? [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10619.359999999999s)]
*  He walks down steps backwards, which is crazy. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10621.44s)]
*  When he fights, he puts that all out the window. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10624.960000000001s)]
*  But when Leon took him down, he tripped him on his bad knee. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10627.12s)]
*  I mean, both of his knees are fucked, but one of his knees is worse. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10631.320000000002s)]
*  And he trips him on his bad knee, and his knee folds over, and he goes back down. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10634.6s)]
*  And Camaro's been pretty open about it, saying, I don't know how much longer my body's going [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10638.720000000001s)]
*  to hold up. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10642.84s)]
*  He's also been pretty open about the fact that when his career is done, he's probably [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10644.0s)]
*  going to get his knees replaced. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10646.6s)]
*  He's probably going to have to. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10647.6s)]
*  I mean, his knees are chewed up, man. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10649.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10651.4s)]
*  Real bad. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10651.92s)]
*  Yeah, I remember being at, we did a thing, the UFC, when they were getting ready to start [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10652.72s)]
*  the PI at Exos, I think, out in Arizona, which is kind of like the Performance Institute [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10658.12s)]
*  prefer NFL players trying to get back into the big league, players in their offseason [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10663.92s)]
*  or rehab. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10670.16s)]
*  And it was me, him, and Max Holloway, and Kelvin Gastelum, actually, that were all part [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10671.16s)]
*  of the group, and they used to send a bunch of us to kind of test it out and give feedback [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10676.12s)]
*  on all that. [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10680.12s)]
*  And yeah, he was, it's amazing that he's dominated the way he has with those knees. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10681.36s)]
*  Oh my God, it's just mental strength. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10687.68s)]
*  It's his mind. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10689.560000000001s)]
*  He just pushes through. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10691.480000000001s)]
*  And you know, Will Harris, who has done an amazing job of documenting the Dagestan Chronicles, [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10693.28s)]
*  and Will's the best. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10700.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10701.0s)]
*  When it comes to MMA documentaries and covering these guys, he's such a good guy that everybody [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10702.16s)]
*  lets him in, they trust him, and he gets all this behind the scenes footage. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10710.76s)]
*  He's got footage of Kamara, where Kamara was openly talking about it, like, I don't know [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10716.88s)]
*  how much longer my body's going to hold up. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10720.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10723.32s)]
*  It's all the wrestling for years and years and years. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10724.32s)]
*  And just genetics, right? [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10727.28s)]
*  You might just, once those knees go early and you just pound on them, and just wrestling [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10728.880000000001s)]
*  in general, man, especially freestyle like that. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10735.12s)]
*  Brutal. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10737.6s)]
*  Brutal. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10738.6s)]
*  So many guys have blown out knees by the time their career is over. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10739.6s)]
*  That necks. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10742.8s)]
*  They're just necks. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10743.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10744.8s)]
*  Even just anybody that's ever done any kind of grappling. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10745.8s)]
*  You know how it is. [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10748.64s)]
*  Well, how about Al Jermain? [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10749.64s)]
*  Al Jermain has a fake disc in his neck. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10750.64s)]
*  You see a lot of guys have that kind of injury. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10753.44s)]
*  Weidman has that. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10755.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10756.16s)]
*  An old coach of mine, I remember him having his neck fused together back then. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10757.48s)]
*  That's scary, man. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10762.24s)]
*  Boss Root, and that's the beginning of his problems. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10764.08s)]
*  He got his neck fused and now his arm. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10766.2s)]
*  And then you have no range where you start losing. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10768.16s)]
*  Yeah, you start losing feeling in your arm. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10770.16s)]
*  Scary shit. [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10772.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10773.92s)]
*  No thanks. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10774.92s)]
*  It's a wild way to live your life, to decide that for the glory and the challenge and just [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10775.92s)]
*  the overwhelming difficulty of becoming a world class fighter or a world champion fighter [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10783.28s)]
*  that you put yourself through so much. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10791.92s)]
*  It's funny that you bring that kind of up because it's hard to talk to people about [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10796.2s)]
*  why you do it if you don't understand it, right? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10801.0s)]
*  If you've never done combat sports or ever have that desire to fight and just be one [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10804.960000000001s)]
*  of the best, it looks crazy to anybody on the outside. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10810.48s)]
*  We look like we're absolutely lunatics, but it's competition to us. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10814.119999999999s)]
*  I don't look at a fight and think, I want to fucking kill that person because I just [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10818.6s)]
*  want to be violent. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10822.76s)]
*  It's like, I want to be better than that person. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10823.76s)]
*  You want to achieve something that seems crazy to other people. [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10827.64s)]
*  And I think that's what upsets a lot of us about it is that you want to do something [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10832.0s)]
*  99% of the people in this world are terrified of doing and walking to that cage is definitely [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10836.359999999999s)]
*  one of the scary things. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10842.8s)]
*  Aside from like anybody active military and does all that kind of stuff. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10844.359999999999s)]
*  That's another level. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10849.16s)]
*  That's what I can't imagine. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10850.439999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10851.919999999998s)]
*  And any of my friends that have served and done that, I'm like, they're like, man, I [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10852.919999999998s)]
*  don't know how you fight and do this. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10855.24s)]
*  I'm like, bro, you fought in wars. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10856.72s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10860.08s)]
*  That's the highest level. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10861.599999999999s)]
*  That's the highest level. [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10862.599999999999s)]
*  It's the same sort of situation. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10863.599999999999s)]
*  They oftentimes want to go back. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10864.84s)]
*  It's like the thrill of that. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10867.36s)]
*  Yep. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10869.36s)]
*  I can't imagine because I know what it's like to have to want that fight feeling, to want [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10870.36s)]
*  that desire to get your hand raised, whether good, bad or ugly. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10874.960000000001s)]
*  And you have like a depression when it's done, man. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10880.32s)]
*  And I'm sure you've heard other fighters talk about this, whether you win or lose, you build [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10883.44s)]
*  up to this moment, this fight camp. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10887.2s)]
*  I'm fighting this guy. [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10889.0s)]
*  I'm going to get to the octagon and then it's done. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10890.0s)]
*  You're like, ah, now what? [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10893.32s)]
*  Times 10 with most people at the end of their career. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10895.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10899.039999999999s)]
*  Because now what? [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10900.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, now the big now what? [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10901.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what do you do? [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10902.24s)]
*  And that's one of the things that I think is beautiful about what you've done. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10903.24s)]
*  You've found something that's a challenge that can occupy your mind and your will and [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10906.48s)]
*  learn things along the way. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10912.48s)]
*  And it's the same feeling though. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10914.199999999999s)]
*  When that race is done and I cross that finish line, as soon as it's done, you're like, oh. [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10915.96s)]
*  And everybody around is like, you fucking got your PR. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10921.64s)]
*  That's great. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10924.76s)]
*  You had your best run. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10925.76s)]
*  You did this or your swim was really good. [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10926.76s)]
*  And it's like, now what? [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10927.96s)]
*  I'm going to go faster. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10929.599999999999s)]
*  It's not fast enough. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10931.599999999999s)]
*  Well, the guys are the real wild ones. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10933.199999999999s)]
*  Like, I've always wondered, like, how does John Jones deal with retirement? [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10935.48s)]
*  Like, is John so wild? [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10938.68s)]
*  Like what is John going to do when it's all done? [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10941.359999999999s)]
*  I mean, for the last three years, John has been thinking, OK, I'm going to build up to [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10943.64s)]
*  become a heavyweight. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10947.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's still had a goal. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10948.56s)]
*  He's got a massive weightlifting program, obviously put in all this work to get so big [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10952.24s)]
*  and really built himself up to be a legitimate heavyweight. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10956.6s)]
*  And now, I mean, and also John is what? [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10960.880000000001s)]
*  Thirty six now? [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10963.36s)]
*  How old is John now? [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10964.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10965.36s)]
*  How old is John Jones? [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10966.36s)]
*  I mean, you go back to John Jones's first fight with Shogun, fighting for the world [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10967.36s)]
*  title. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10971.800000000001s)]
*  I always say this, one of the wildest things I've ever seen, the guys fighting for the [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10972.800000000001s)]
*  world title, youngest guy, thirty five, youngest guy ever to win the title. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10975.2s)]
*  He opens up against a legend with a flying knee. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10980.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's just wild. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10983.76s)]
*  You can't. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10985.68s)]
*  John was just wild and doing that on like an hour of sleep. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10986.68s)]
*  Yeah, I can remember even back at Jackson's when we'd be there, he'd come rolling in and [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10991.960000000001s)]
*  you could, you know, I didn't know him personally then, so I don't know what he was doing, but [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=10997.84s)]
*  you could tell partying. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11002.24s)]
*  He was probably partying and he'd come in and just beat everybody's ass, clean the room [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11004.12s)]
*  and talent. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11009.199999999999s)]
*  Just no issue. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11010.199999999999s)]
*  Talent is not fair in its distribution. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11012.72s)]
*  It is not. [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11015.48s)]
*  No, not at all. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11016.48s)]
*  And that's why so many people get so pissed. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11019.199999999999s)]
*  It's like, I did everything right. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11021.6s)]
*  And this guy rolls in and kicks your ass. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11024.64s)]
*  Yeah, I'm very curious to see how he handles Serial Gone, because Serial Gone is so fucking [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11028.4s)]
*  smooth and fast on the feet. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11034.359999999999s)]
*  The KO of Taito Iwasa. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11038.0s)]
*  All the kicks that he was showing in that one. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11039.0s)]
*  My God. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11041.720000000001s)]
*  The body work. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11042.720000000001s)]
*  My God. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11043.720000000001s)]
*  But then you have to think Francis out wrestled him. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11044.720000000001s)]
*  He took him down. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11049.320000000002s)]
*  That's the big. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11050.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11051.880000000001s)]
*  And if Francis can take him down and out wrestle him. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11052.880000000001s)]
*  What the hell is John Jones going to do with him? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11055.2s)]
*  Or Ken is John Jones as effective as a heavyweight. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11057.720000000001s)]
*  Because of the size. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11061.480000000001s)]
*  That's the thing. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11062.480000000001s)]
*  Francis might not be the strongest wrestler, but he's humongous. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11063.48s)]
*  Right. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11066.6s)]
*  So even though he might not have the technical skills that John does. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11067.6s)]
*  Just physical strength. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11071.119999999999s)]
*  That's what I keep saying to everybody that asks me any questions about that one. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11072.119999999999s)]
*  I'm like, we're going to find out. [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11076.08s)]
*  This is truly one. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11077.96s)]
*  We don't know. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11079.3s)]
*  We have nothing to base it on because we can hear Jim's stories about how he handled heavyweights. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11080.3s)]
*  But what's that like in the Octagon on Fight Night? [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11085.06s)]
*  Also, Cyril Gans had ample opportunity to prepare for that kind of wrestling strategy. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11089.72s)]
*  Whereas I bet with Francis Ngono, he didn't think Francis was going to try to take him [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11095.0s)]
*  down. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11098.279999999999s)]
*  No, not like that. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11099.279999999999s)]
*  He probably didn't prepare for a grappling match at all. [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11100.279999999999s)]
*  He probably prepared for movement and tried to out point him. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11101.279999999999s)]
*  And then suddenly you find yourself getting put on your back. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11104.039999999999s)]
*  And then you got to think like athleticism. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11107.599999999999s)]
*  Cyril Gans is so athletic and he's such a good striker. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11109.48s)]
*  When was the last time John fought a guy who was that athletic and a good striker? [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11112.48s)]
*  Well, that's Dominic Reyes. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11115.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11116.8s)]
*  That gave him a lot of trouble. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11117.88s)]
*  Gave him a lot of trouble. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11118.88s)]
*  And Dominic Reyes is another one, right? [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11119.88s)]
*  At the top of the heap. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11121.56s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, boom, he just keeps getting flatlined. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED-2YGEJKWE&t=11122.96s)]
