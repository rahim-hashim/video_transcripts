# Joe Rogan Experience #1393 - James Wilks & Chris Kresser - The Game Changers Debate
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 05, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0zgNY_kqlI)
*  All right, here we go. First of all, welcome James.
*  I really appreciate you having me on.
*  My pleasure. And welcome again, Chris. So this is essentially giving you an opportunity
*  to refute some of the things that Chris has said about your film. We should tell everybody
*  that you're the producer of Game Changers.
*  Yeah, I'm one of two producers.
*  I know you also from, of course, from the Ultimate Fighter, UFC, and Chris, this is
*  your what, fourth appearance here?
*  Fourth or fifth.
*  Fourth or fifth. Did you get a chance to see what Chris had said?
*  Yeah, I've watched it.
*  You watched it. Okay.
*  I've made a bunch of notes.
*  Excellent. Let's start from the beginning. The beginning of the show, the beginning of
*  your film, you talked about the gladiators and all that stuff and the fact that you were
*  shocked to find out that they had eaten a vegetarian diet.
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, that's been misrepresented, right? So even before the film came out, people
*  were like, oh, there's this vegan film coming out. It's vegan propaganda. People were judging
*  the film before they'd seen it. Right. And the vegan sort of community really pushed
*  it. Like, hey, look at this documentary. So there's been things saying they claim that
*  the gladiators were vegan. Right. And if we can just prove they think the whole film is
*  based on this premise, that was just like an inciting incident for me to start digging
*  into it. First of all, Fabian Kent said they were predominantly vegetarian, and I said
*  they ate mostly plants. And that is what I couldn't believe. Right? So they wouldn't
*  claim that they were vegan, didn't even claim that they were vegetarian. They were just
*  fueled mostly by plants. You know, and people say, oh, you cherry picked one location. It
*  was the only known gladiator burial site in the world based on archeological and anthropological
*  data at the time.
*  At the time when you read the study? Because there have been other studies that were-
*  Well, there's been some that have been questioned. So like there's one in York, there was one
*  in New York at the time that had a few gladiator skeletons, and it was questioned whether that
*  was the thing. But I'm happy to address every critique. But if you wouldn't mind, I just
*  want to make sure that Chris, you're on the same page about how evidence is evaluated.
*  Sure.
*  So Chris, would you consider yourself a nutrition expert?
*  No, I would consider myself someone who is adept at reading the literature and learning
*  from experts in nutrition, medicine, anthropology, etc. Although I do have master's level training
*  in nutrition.
*  Okay. So is it fair to say that any one study cannot show what the human race should be
*  eating? Is that fair? Any one study?
*  Absolutely.
*  So basically, any time you show a study, if you say something, you have to give a citation
*  for it, right? Is that fair to say? And then someone can claim that that's cherry picked.
*  Because you've got to show a study or some studies, and then someone can claim it's cherry
*  picked, right? So what we have to do in order to understand nutrition is look at the totality
*  of the evidence. And I just want to make sure we're on the same page, and then we can address
*  each critique if that's okay. Is that okay?
*  Sure. That is the core of my argument.
*  Right, exactly. So you would say, is it fair to say like there's three main areas? So there
*  would be like preclinical data, which would either be in animals or in test tubes, petri
*  dishes, right? There'd be observational data, where you look at people and see how they're
*  doing. And obviously there's the healthy user bias potential. And there's interventional
*  trials, right? So let's just take trans fats, for example, right? You look in a petri dish
*  at endothelial cells and trans fats, and you can see that it creates vascular inflammation
*  in those cells, right? And then you look at people who eat more trans fats, and they have
*  higher levels of inflammation. And then you can actually do interventional randomized
*  control trials, and you can tell that trans fats cause inflammation. So we basically all
*  agree that trans fats are bad, based on all of those data points. Is that fair? Okay.
*  So therefore, again, if you're a study, anyone study, people can just, someone can just claim
*  that you're cherry picking, right? You can just say cherry picking. Everyone can say
*  that. I could say that you're cherry picking, you can say that I'm cherry picking.
*  Not necessarily, because there are meta-analyses and reviews that are built for this purpose
*  to look at the totality of evidence. So if you're in the film, for example, pointing
*  to many meta-analyses that summarize all of the research that's been done on a topic,
*  I wouldn't have said that that's cherry picking.
*  Fair enough. I agree with that. Okay, so basically, in philosophy, there's this, it's a logical
*  fallacy called appeal to authority, right? But in the real world, you know, you have
*  to look at experts that are specialists in their field. So if I, you know, I just got
*  shoulder surgery not long ago, right? So I went to a shoulder surgeon, I didn't go to
*  a dentist. If I want to learn about comedy or, you know, fight announcement, I might
*  come and talk to you, right? If I want to learn about acupuncture or understand chi
*  more, I might come to Chris because you've got a master's degree in traditional oriental
*  medicine, you're a licensed acupuncturist, right? So if I want to learn about that, Chris
*  is someone that I might want to go to. So what I'm saying is the World Health Organization,
*  the FAO, the American Heart Association, the 2015-2020 dietary guidelines, are all suggesting
*  to eat predominantly plant-based diets, right? And they're saying that vegetarian and vegan
*  diets are helpful for all life stages, including for pregnancy, childbirth, so through childbirth,
*  breastfeeding, adolescents, athletes, and so on. Okay, that's the general consensus.
*  Can I just finish? And so, and I've got a bunch of slides, if you don't believe anything,
*  I've got a bunch of slides showing the position papers for all of these. So let's skip through
*  that. So you'd agree that those?
*  No, I wouldn't necessarily agree.
*  Okay, so let's go to the slides.
*  Recommendations of...
*  Okay, so can we go to slide one?
*  Those recommendations change over time.
*  No, they do change over time.
*  And I would also say that I'm on a predominantly plant-based diet.
*  Well, exactly.
*  So then what are we arguing about?
*  If you look at two-thirds of my plate is plants. Well, this was my point before.
*  Yeah, but no, you're being unfair. That's really, really unfair, because last time you
*  pointed out that the totality of coverage of the plate is not reflective of the calories.
*  You said that on...
*  Yeah, but that has nothing to do with what he's saying. He's not talking about calories.
*  He's talking about what is predominantly his diet. It's mostly plants.
*  You've got to base it on calories. You can't base it on the amount of food.
*  Why would we need to base it on calories?
*  If you're saying that your diet is predominantly plant-based, then either one were on the same
*  page, right? Because that's what I'm talking about.
*  No, we're not. Because the main question here in my mind is whether there is evidence that
*  supports being on a 100% plant-based diet with no animal products versus a diet that
*  includes a lot of plant foods and some animal foods.
*  I thought you were critiquing the film which was talking about plant-based diets. So, plant-based
*  diets means getting the vast majority of calories from plants and limiting or excluding animal
*  foods.
*  But the film essentially was all about only eating plants.
*  No. Okay, so...
*  There was no recommendation whatsoever about eating animals.
*  There were references about how animal products will kill you, dairy products will kill you,
*  all kinds of different animal foods.
*  Meat is like cigarettes.
*  No, that claim was never made. See?
*  But there was a connection.
*  No, there was not.
*  There was an inferred connection.
*  No, there was not.
*  What was the connection to cigarettes then?
*  The connection to cigarettes was the way the playbook that is being used by the... See,
*  that's people are conflating like, what the hell?
*  The playbook is the same playbook that they use.
*  The playbook is the same way that they're using athletes and they're using advertising.
*  We never made the claim which...
*  Explain that then. Be clear.
*  So the playbook that was used by the smoking industry. So they pay for studies, right?
*  And we know even with food, right, this has been done with cigarettes, it's been done
*  with drugs, it's been done with food. Research shows that industry-funded studies are four
*  to eight times more likely to have a conclusion in their favor for their product.
*  So this is what the smoking industry did. Then they got doctors to say that smoking
*  wasn't bad. And then they got athletes to show like, hey, smoking is good. That was
*  the parallel that we drew. We never drew the parallel that was drawn in what the hell.
*  So I want to make that really clear.
*  And I've seen this in articles saying, you know, they connected meat. We didn't do that.
*  Like, if you watch the film, we never said...
*  But what did you? Why did you have that in there though? If you're not saying that meat...
*  Because they're using the same playbook.
*  If you're not saying that meat causes cancer, you're saying they're using the same playbook.
*  There are some specific claims that chicken, eating chicken and fish causes cancer, eating
*  dairy causes cancer. There were quotes from doctors, vegan doctors in the film.
*  No, they're not vegan. That's the other misrepresentation. So can I just go back, can we just finish
*  the evaluating evidence and then get to each point? Because I'm happy to have every critique.
*  So basically, the consensus, and you're saying they're changing over time, they are changing
*  because as we get better at science, they're becoming more, the recommendations becoming
*  more plant-based, despite industry influence from studies and marketing and people being
*  paid off.
*  Industry influence goes both ways. The sugar industry in the 60s is big exposé, pointing
*  the finger at fat as the culprit.
*  I don't think that is the culprit. So that's a straw man argument.
*  But he's not saying you are saying that.
*  No, no, I'm saying the industry is... I agree. The sugar industry is terrible and I would
*  agree that... But can I just... Can we just finish the evaluating evidence?
*  But the thing about this section of the film was you were making some sort of a correlation
*  between cigarettes and...
*  The way that it was marketed.
*  The way that it was marketed.
*  And the way that...
*  And then the way meat is marketed.
*  Correct. It's the same company, it's the same company, it's exponent.
*  But why would you do... You would never do that about like carrots or kale or things
*  that are predominantly healthy, right?
*  Because they didn't do it.
*  But if you're saying that you're connecting the two things, you're connecting something
*  that clearly causes cancer, cigarettes, and these studies that were made to show people
*  that it didn't. They were paid off, these studies were fake, they were essentially cherry-picked
*  fake studies that were financed by the tobacco industry in order to get people to buy more
*  cigarettes. You're making this same sort of claim about meat.
*  Which means you think that meat is bad for you.
*  Okay. That's where we're...
*  No, we can disagree about that. I'm almost finished with the evaluating evidence. So
*  basically, what we did when we interviewed the experts is we chose leading experts in
*  their individual fields, collectively with thousands of articles in the peer-reviewed
*  literature, right? And this is one of the bummers about making a documentary. It's like
*  you put the lower third on, people don't get to read it. So we had the Chair of Nutrition
*  at Harvard, the President of the American College of Cardiology, the Lead Delegate of
*  Urology for the American Medical Association, the Chair of Anthropology at Harvard, the
*  Director of Energy, Environment, and Resources at Chatham House, really respected... So talking
*  about vegan doctors, I saw some of them involved in hunting, some of them involved in animal
*  testing. I saw one of them eating a chicken sandwich at lunch. So let's not say that this
*  was a vegan bias coming into it, because that's just not true. These doctors...
*  We're stretching out here. We were talking just about this one section where you connect
*  cigarettes and meat. So you're saying that the same sort of...
*  The same playbook is used.
*  The same playbook. But there's no evidence that meat is bad for you.
*  No, we can get into that and I'm happy to...
*  But this is something that's actually recently been established by mainstream medicine. You
*  understand that, right? That they've released new studies, releasing these new studies saying
*  that there's no longer this concern that red meat causes cancer or that even...
*  This is also an appeal to an authority, because I can find many illustrious doctors and experts
*  who are highly qualified that will disagree with your point of view that a diet must be
*  100% plant-based in order to be healthy.
*  Okay, Jay, can you clarify your position? I want to know what we're actually debating here.
*  Because you think meat is bad for you.
*  I do.
*  You do. But this was the connection that you made with cigarettes in the film.
*  No. Yes. No, I think that they're both promoting something bad because there's a profit incentive.
*  So you think that meat is bad for you and then you think that they're promoting it knowing
*  that it's bad just for profit.
*  Okay. So all Chris has to do to debunk the film, right, is convince the people watching
*  and listening that he knows more about the consensus and the experts in their field.
*  I would understand if he was...
*  No, I'm not interested. I'm actually not that interested in consensus of experts. I'm looking
*  at that research that is published, the peer-reviewed research that is published, including meta-analyses
*  and even reviews of meta-analyses that have been done. A perfect example is the whole
*  dairy and cancer section that we talked about where you had argued or Walter Willett argued
*  that dairy products cause cancer. And I pointed to a meta-analyses that looked at over 150
*  different reviews and 84% of those found no association. So how is that not part of this
*  discussion where we're talking about hundreds of scientists across different continents,
*  different countries that are using peer-reviewed science to show this. But in the movie, just
*  one expert is pointing to one group of studies without mentioning that. That sounds disingenuous.
*  That's a fair point, right? So this is the 2018 meta-analyses. Have you got a slide for
*  that or... If not, I've got your slide, 107. Slide 107.
*  No, this is a 2019 meta-analyses.
*  2019, 153 studies, right?
*  Yeah, and I can...
*  Now, I'm really glad you...
*  A lot further into it, because that's not the only one.
*  I'd love to, because at nine o'clock last night, until nine o'clock last night, I thought Chris
*  just made a bunch of mistakes interpreting the data. And I'm going to show you how he
*  is misleading people on this study. So if you can bring up slide 107, Jamie. Can we
*  see the slide?
*  Yeah, yeah, put it up.
*  Okay.
*  Is this it?
*  Okay. So you see what he's putting quotes. Okay. Eighty-four percent of meta-analyses
*  on dairy consumption showed either no association or an inverse association between dairy and
*  cancer. And then you go on to point out, what an inverse means is that people that ate more
*  dairy got lower rates of cancer. That's what he's implying. When you put something in quotes,
*  what does that mean to you?
*  Means that's what he said.
*  Yeah, but it's... That quotation is quoting the study, right? Fair enough? Is that what
*  they said in the study?
*  No, that's not what they said in the study. That was my summary of the evidence of the
*  study in the study.
*  Right. Thank you. But when you put something in quotes, that's misleading.
*  But that's his quote.
*  Okay, fine. Okay, let's go with that.
*  But he's not putting things in quotes saying that someone else said it.
*  Totally. Totally. I mean, that's how... Anything you do in literature, when you put something
*  in quotation marks, you're quoting the study. But let's just bypass that. I'll agree. Okay,
*  so can you bring up slide 109, see what they actually said?
*  Okay, this is the actual quote.
*  Okay.
*  Out of 153 reported meta-analyses comparing highest versus lower dairy consumption, 109,
*  71%, showed no evidence of a statistically significant association between dairy consumption
*  and instance of cancers. 20 showed a decreased risk of cancers with dairy consumption, and
*  24 showed an increased risk of cancers with dairy consumption. Now, this is actually...
*  Until last night, like 9 o'clock, I realized what he was doing. Okay? If you want to go
*  to... I mean, just to sum it up, if you go to slide 110...
*  Wait, can we stay on here for a second? What's your interpretation of...
*  Do you agree that that was the quote from the study?
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay, good.
*  But I'm asking you what your interpretation... Does that, in your mind, show a strong connection
*  between dairy and cancer?
*  Okay, Joe, you're going to really realize here what Chris is doing. Okay? This is really...
*  And I'm glad that you brought it up.
*  Please answer what he's saying.
*  Okay. So, can I just say, the reason you brought this up is because Walter Willett said there
*  was a strong connection between prostate cancer and dairy, correct?
*  Yeah.
*  So you brought up something about all cancers. Okay.
*  Yeah. And in this study, about half of the study showed a connection between prostate
*  cancer and dairy, and half didn't.
*  Right. Okay, so...
*  That's still not a compelling argument that dairy is associated with cancer.
*  Okay, so can we...
*  You got a coin flip, basically.
*  Right, that's not actually true. I'll explain why that's not true.
*  You still haven't answered my question about this data here.
*  I will. I'm trying to tell you. I'm trying to tell you.
*  Slide 110.
*  Well, let's stay with this, explain this first, and then we'll move to the next slide.
*  Okay, no, no, slide... Next 110 is explaining this.
*  It's just breaking that down.
*  Okay.
*  So there were statistically significant associations between dairy consumption and incidence of
*  cancers. 71% showed no evidence, 13 showed a decreased risk, and 16% showed an increased
*  risk.
*  So what Chris did to represent this, he added 71% and 13% to make 84%. Right? You follow?
*  This is how you got it, right? So you added 71% and 13% to get 84%.
*  So his statement from this study was 84% showed no evidence or a decreased risk. That's what
*  he made you believe.
*  Well, 71% shows no evidence, 13% shows decreased risk. If you add the two of them together,
*  that's 84% shows no evidence or a decreased risk.
*  But what he could have said is 71% plus 16% and that's 87%. He could have said 87% show
*  no evidence or an increased risk.
*  That's 84.
*  How are you getting 87?
*  No, 71 plus 16.
*  Oh.
*  So I could make the claim...
*  No evidence or a decreased risk or an increased risk.
*  No, no, we're getting really into semantics here.
*  No, we're not.
*  The burden of proof you were claiming in the film was claiming dairy causes cancer. My claim
*  was the bulk of the evidence suggests there is no association or inverse association.
*  That's true.
*  You're playing with words, James.
*  70% shows no evidence.
*  No, I agree. I agree.
*  13% shows decreased risk. But hold on a second. The decreased risk and the increased risk
*  are almost the same.
*  Right, but which is higher?
*  Which is what he talked about before.
*  Which is higher?
*  Which is higher?
*  3% shows increased risk on this one study.
*  The point of this study is that his study that he brought up showing this is very strong
*  evidence. His statement was very misleading. He added up those two and then he finished
*  it up by saying, so basically there's an inverse correlation, but he did not show... He could
*  have said 87% showed no risk or an increased risk. Instead, he chose to summarize it saying
*  84%.
*  But there's no risk and an increased risk. It's a very different thing.
*  No, I know. Joe.
*  Because you're talking about something causing cancer.
*  No, exactly. And so there wasn't strong enough things to find that total cancer was increased,
*  but we know that as research shows, this included, did it not, industry-funded research.
*  Two thirds of research is industry-funded.
*  Right. And we know that... Yeah, and research shows that...
*  Are you proposing that we throw out every study? Because one of the main studies in
*  your film was sponsored by the Haas Avocado Board, the one that claims that animal products
*  contribute to inflammation.
*  I'm not suggesting we throw them out. I'm not suggesting we throw them out. I'm saying
*  that industry-funded studies... And by the way, industry-funded studies, they typically
*  only put them out when it shows in their favor. There's no obligation for industry when they
*  do a study to release it.
*  Yeah, I'm familiar with that. I've written a lot about that myself.
*  So, Joe, do you think that the industry and the meat and dairy industry has far more money
*  than the plant-based industry, right? You'd agree with that?
*  Actually we can look at some statistics on that.
*  Okay, but Joe...
*  I don't know who's spending more money.
*  Okay, would you disagree that industry-funded research has a four to eight times increased
*  risk compared to non-industry-funded research in finding collusions in their favor?
*  I think industry research is definitely a problem, but I see it as a problem across
*  the board. And I have some statistics we can talk about.
*  And so do you not admit that you here led the audience to believe that there was a potentially
*  decreased risk overall? You made it sound very high because you didn't split between
*  the no difference...
*  That was not my intention. It was just to summarize the data, not to spend 10 minutes
*  as we're doing now talking about one study when there's a huge...
*  Right, because you made a very misleading claim.
*  But no, it's misleading if you said it the other way.
*  My claim was completely accurate.
*  If you said showed no evidence or showed an increased risk, 84%, that's...
*  87%.
*  ...or 87%, that seems like it's misleading.
*  I don't think that would be misleading also.
*  Do you want to look at...
*  I'm just saying he could have said that, but he chose...
*  But we're talking about something causing cancer, James.
*  Exactly. So he shouldn't be making that claim.
*  So an increased risk is what we're looking for. What we're looking for is evidence of
*  it causing cancer. 71%, the bulk of the evidence shows no evidence.
*  That's exactly what I have... my point.
*  If you're claiming that something increases, then I'm saying...
*  So, Joe, honestly...
*  Here's all this research that doesn't show that.
*  You honestly don't think that that statement... instead of just putting 71% showed no evidence,
*  13% showed... that would be the fairest, the most honest summary of that statement.
*  I would say that if you wanted to say it the most accurately, yes, that's the best way
*  to say it.
*  Thank you. That's what I'm saying.
*  71% showed no evidence, 13% showed decreased risk, but I don't have a problem with saying
*  84% showed no evidence or a decreased risk...
*  It's true.
*  ...because we're talking about something causing cancer.
*  That's the relevant point.
*  That's the relevant point. The relevant point is, does this study show that dairy causes
*  cancer? The primary evidence, most of the evidence says it shows no evidence or it shows
*  a decreased risk. That's the bulk of it.
*  No, the bulk of it...
*  That's 84%.
*  Versus 87%. It doesn't.
*  No, no, no. 87% shows increased risk is only 16%.
*  No, no, but you're just...
*  You're adding no evidence to increased risk to get 87%.
*  That's illogical.
*  Okay, then let's throw out the no evidence. Let's throw that out.
*  Let's throw out no evidence.
*  Why would we throw that out?
*  Why would we throw out?
*  The burden of proof is to show evidence that indicates that dairy causes cancer. If you
*  do a study and it shows that it doesn't, then that's not in support of the claim that dairy...
*  I'm agreeing that the meta-analysis could not find an association, but I'm also pointing
*  out that industry-funded studies were included in it and they are more likely to find no
*  connection.
*  Okay, so there's 153 studies. You're claiming we should just... That all of them are industry-funded
*  and we should throw out this huge review of 153 meta-analyses because of industry funding.
*  What is the basis for that claim?
*  No, I'm saying that it sways the results. You can't say that?
*  I don't...
*  But you know the industry...
*  I don't accept that I have 153 studies that were in this meta-analyses that they're going
*  to sway the results to the point where these findings aren't valid. We could do the same
*  thing with all of the studies that you have linked to in the film.
*  Well, we can get that.
*  We can also look at other studies on dairy and cardio-metabolic outcomes that we have.
*  I've got lots of large reviews that we can look at.
*  And again, anyone can bring up...
*  This is a pointless discussion to have if you're just going to sit there and say industry
*  funding makes these results invalid.
*  That's not my only point.
*  You're saying it makes them suspect.
*  Correct.
*  Yes.
*  And it could have swayed in the other direction.
*  It has in the past.
*  In that sense, I do agree with you about the cigarette thing.
*  So many of the 153 meta-analyses, which each also had individual studies in them, are so
*  biased by industry funding that we can't count on the findings.
*  Well, I would hope that you would know more than I. I mean, basically you've got sitting
*  here...
*  Why would...
*  You know, this is a...
*  We can't get very far in this discussion if you're going to claim that we can't even talk
*  about studies in the peer-reviewed literature because industry funding completely biases
*  the findings.
*  No, I'm not saying that's the case.
*  I'm saying just because they couldn't...
*  Even though they were more showing an increased risk than showed a decreased risk, right?
*  I am saying that it's possible that the industry funding...
*  That's a misleading statement.
*  More showed increased than decreased.
*  That's correct.
*  No.
*  But there's 71% showed no change at all.
*  No, I agree with that.
*  I agree.
*  I agree.
*  So that's a wash.
*  So no, it's not a wash.
*  It's not even close to a wash change.
*  No, it's not a wash.
*  If you have a hypothesis, this thing causes cancer, and then you do a ton of studies and
*  there's no association, that hypothesis is no longer correct.
*  It's not a wash.
*  No, that's actually not true based on epidemiology.
*  If you have 10 studies that show no association and 10 that show an association, then that
*  outcome is an association.
*  But you don't have that.
*  You don't have that at all here.
*  But I'm not...
*  Again, I'm not arguing...
*  What he said, you have 84% that show nothing or a decreased risk.
*  Right, and you also have a...
*  You could say 84% showed no evidence and then...
*  And forget about decreased risk.
*  Just say 84% showed no evidence.
*  Forget about decreased risk.
*  You still have only 16% showed an increased risk.
*  When you do an epidemiology study, you have to take into account all the other factors
*  in these person's lives.
*  Totally.
*  You have to take into account whether they drink, whether they smoke, whether they exercise.
*  Sedentary lifestyle.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  So, if you had something that was causing cancer, you would expect the results to be
*  flipped.
*  You would expect the results to be 16% showed no evidence, 71% or 84% showed an increase.
*  That would be something you would say, hey, this is causing cancer.
*  This is more likely.
*  Exactly.
*  That's not how epidemiology works, though.
*  If you had...
*  Well, epidemiology is slippery anyway.
*  No, I agree.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  How is that not how epidemiology works?
*  If you had 10 studies showing no evidence, just because you don't find something doesn't
*  mean that it exists.
*  The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.
*  Okay, well let's say this.
*  If you had 100 studies and 70 of those studies showed an increased risk of cancer, wouldn't
*  you say that thing causes cancer most likely?
*  Well, if it was all epidemiology, then it's a question you can't tell the correlation.
*  Okay, so let's do 100 studies and 70% now show no evidence.
*  Wouldn't you say it's most likely that there's no evidence?
*  No, that's not how it works.
*  Oh.
*  How does it work?
*  So if you've got 70 studies that couldn't show a correlation and 30% that did, that
*  is still in favor of showing that there is a correlation?
*  Well, no, no, no.
*  Now we're doing 70 studies.
*  70%.
*  Look, 70% of the people in these studies, if you have all these studies, you have 100
*  studies and 70% of the people in all these studies are showing an increased risk of cancer.
*  We would agree.
*  Right.
*  Well, you can't prove causation based on observational, but sure.
*  But you would agree there's most likely a connection.
*  Now if it's reversed, now 70% of these studies show there's no increased risk of cancer.
*  Or 84%.
*  Or 84%, which is because you add in the decreased risk.
*  We're not even adding the decreased risk, which shows that you're less likely to get
*  cancer, which is almost the same as an increased risk of cancer, which in my eyes is a wash.
*  You would assume that we're talking about something that doesn't give you cancer.
*  Well, I agree that this study found that they couldn't prove a causation, right?
*  They couldn't prove a link between cancer and...
*  But you made it out like he was being deceptive.
*  He is being deceptive.
*  I don't agree with that.
*  I don't agree with that because you're trying to show that these studies are proving, or
*  at least making this correlation between consumption of dairy products and cancer.
*  But the evidence doesn't show that.
*  If you want to look at it in its entirety, the evidence shows that most of the 71% showed
*  no evidence of it causing cancer.
*  13% showed it's actually better for you.
*  You have less risk of cancer than not eating dairy.
*  13%.
*  And 16% showed more.
*  And 16% showed increased risk of cancer.
*  And again, when you talk about epidemiology studies, when you're talking about 16 out
*  of 100, you have to throw in all the other factors in these people's lives.
*  I agree.
*  That's why they didn't find it.
*  But can I just...
*  The reason you point this up is prostate cancer, right?
*  And so if you look at slide 113...
*  Prostate cancer was...
*  That's disturbing.
*  With dairy consumption versus...
*  Wait, that's not...
*  Sorry, 113.
*  But a lot of people get prostate cancer too.
*  Isn't that also an issue?
*  That's a high risk.
*  That is 113.
*  Isn't that a high risk for males?
*  Prostate cancer?
*  It's a high one.
*  Sorry, 112.
*  Whether they consume milk or not.
*  So just so...
*  In this metronome that you point to, the highest connection that they could find between dairy
*  and any type of cancer was prostate cancer.
*  So if you look at the black line, that shows no association.
*  If you look at the green line, that's decreased association.
*  And the red line was increased association.
*  That was the meta-analysis that you provided.
*  So you brought this study up because Dr. Walter Willett, who is the chair of nutrition at
*  Harvard, he's one of the most published nutrition scientists of all time, if not the most published.
*  No disagreement there.
*  Right?
*  And so he is coming to the determination that prostate cancer is linked and it's likely
*  that it's causal.
*  And this very study...
*  Back up.
*  Half and half.
*  That's no evidence of a causal relationship, James.
*  There's no evidence of a causal relationship.
*  Okay.
*  Dr. Walter Willett is in just any type of...
*  Let's talk about this study rather than appeal to authority.
*  You just said yourself that's a rhetorical fallacy.
*  It's a fallacy unless it's the appeal to valid authority.
*  Because literally, if I want to know about...
*  Are you saying like...
*  So if I want...
*  Let's say we look at mixed martial arts and Chris goes, well, I've never done anything
*  with mixed martial arts, but I think I know more about anthropology, nutrition, like I
*  know more about boxing, kickboxing, jiu-jitsu, and wrestling.
*  So we're talking about the consensus.
*  We're talking about leading experts in their field with thousands of peer-reviewed...
*  Well, there is no consensus.
*  There are experts who are very illustrious who would disagree and would look at this
*  study and reach the same exact conclusion that I did.
*  Same with Flat Earthers.
*  No, there's no reliable proven connection between dairy and prostate.
*  You have half studies showing an association, half studies showing no association, not to
*  mention the fact that that's, as you just said, that even if there was a strong correlation,
*  that doesn't prove causation.
*  Well, this was a...
*  You like this because it included also randomized controlled trials.
*  Yeah.
*  And I'm saying, should we trust Walter Willett, who at the time was the chair of nutrition
*  at Harvard...
*  The studies is what we need to look at.
*  But we're way off here.
*  No, no, we're way off because it's a...
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  The question was still...
*  There are a lot of inferences made in the film, whether they were intentional or not
*  on your part, that dairy...
*  People are hearing, oh, dairy is going to cause prostate cancer.
*  They're going to extend that to cancer.
*  There are other claims in the film made about dairy and metabolic issues and saturated fat
*  and metabolic issues.
*  The operative question that I'm trying to answer is, do the data support that?
*  Not does Walter Willett think that or any other expert in the film.
*  Do the data support that conclusion?
*  Right.
*  I agree.
*  Even in that study, the data don't strongly support that.
*  If you have half study saying yes, half study saying no, that's not a clear signal.
*  It's definitely not evidence of a causal relationship.
*  Walter Willett or anyone say there's a strong relationship and we know the mechanism and
*  there's, you know, it's causal, that is disputed by the study.
*  Didn't you tell me that two thirds of people have an intolerance towards milk and towards
*  dairy?
*  And I have a study here...
*  Is that what the number is?
*  It's one out... two out of three people in the world...
*  Okay.
*  So can I...
*  Because this is actually to your point.
*  Sure.
*  Two out of three people have an intolerance towards dairy in the world.
*  And if you're talking about a study that shows 50% of the people in these studies that are
*  consuming dairy, there's a correlation between prostate cancer and dairy.
*  Wouldn't you assume that maybe the same thing that we're talking about with two thirds of
*  people are intolerant to something, they consume this thing that's intolerant, it causes inflammation
*  in the body and that inflammation in the body could possibly be leading to cancer.
*  No, not correct.
*  Dairy is inversely associated with inflammation.
*  So we can pull up a study there.
*  Okay, inversely associated with inflammation, but if people are irritated by dairy, if they
*  have an intolerance to dairy, and you said two thirds of people...
*  Here's what I would suspect there, that if we segmented those people out and said, let's
*  do a study, find out who's intolerant of dairy and find out who isn't, you would see even
*  better results for dairy.
*  Because despite the fact that some people are lactose intolerant, we're still seeing
*  in that meta-analyses that there's no association in most cases and an inverse association in
*  other cases.
*  But this cancer thing, hold on a second, but this prostate cancer thing is not most.
*  This is 50-50, right?
*  I know.
*  But why is 50-50 disturbing?
*  So imagine what you're saying.
*  You're saying if half of the...
*  Okay, well if dairy gives half people cancer and doesn't give the other half cancer, then
*  I can just think dairy.
*  Second of all, do you see what Chris just did?
*  That's not what that said.
*  But you see what he said here?
*  These are epidemiology, James.
*  It's not dairy gives anyone cancer.
*  It's association.
*  No, that's not.
*  Your meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials.
*  This is actually to you.
*  Can I stop this though?
*  If someone's intolerant of something, that means your body is irritated by it, it means
*  it causes some sort of disturbance, right?
*  Whether it's inflammation or gastrointestinal disorder, you start farting and that's what
*  happens when people are lactose intolerant, right?
*  That irritates the body.
*  Wouldn't there be...
*  Wouldn't you assume that something your body isn't tolerant to would possibly be the cause
*  of disruption or disease?
*  Certainly could be.
*  Right.
*  So now if you're...
*  But if you're looking at two thirds of the population are intolerant to dairy...
*  But why would that cause prostate cancer and no other cancers?
*  I don't know.
*  That doesn't make sense.
*  That's why...
*  It is carlite that does not...
*  That's why...
*  When you see that kind of thing in the data, it's a red flag because there's no logical
*  explanation for why it would cause prostate cancer but no other cancers.
*  Why is there more of an association there with that?
*  Jamie, pull up...
*  Just Google dairy products and inflammation review of the clinical evidence.
*  This is a review, systematic review of 52 clinical trials and they found that dairy
*  products were inversely associated with inflammatory markers, which means that people who consume
*  dairy actually had lower levels of inflammatory markers.
*  So the hypothesis that dairy is inflammatory and that's why it's causing cancer doesn't
*  seem to hold up in the literature.
*  So can I just say...
*  Go ahead.
*  So first of all, there might be studies he can bring up.
*  I'm not even a nutrition scientist.
*  I'm like a combatives trainer.
*  And so you also said that you're not an expert in nutrition.
*  And so what we have to believe today is that, Chris, really, it is about the meta-analyses,
*  but it's about the meta-analyses.
*  It's about the totality of taking into account all the evidence, not just one meta-analysis
*  or a meta-analysis of a meta-analysis, but all of the data.
*  And so what you're asking people to believe is that you are better at interpreting the
*  data than people that are experts in their field.
*  There are many experts who would agree with me.
*  You just didn't choose to interview them in the film.
*  No, actually, we did interview some that I can tell you about in a second on the other
*  side and I'll tell you why we didn't include them.
*  But you are asking people...
*  I would understand it if suddenly Chris has figured out this nutrivol diet that he figures
*  out something about nutrition, that he's better than the consent...
*  He knows more about the consensus and more about the majority of leading experts.
*  But to believe that Chris knows more about anthropology, urology, heart disease, environment...
*  Why include anthropology?
*  Because that's what you tried to do with anthropology in the film.
*  And successfully, because the majority of anthropologists agree with what I said.
*  You chose probably one of the few that would agree with the idea that humans primarily
*  ate exclusively plant-based diet for most of human evolution.
*  We can go into that again.
*  I'm actually representing the consensus viewpoint in anthropology, James.
*  No, you're actually not.
*  It would be hard pressed to find a consensus group of experts that agree with that idea.
*  So you're saying that Richard Rang and the chair of anthropology that we interviewed
*  does not represent the scientific consensus of anthropology.
*  If you're arguing that he is saying that humans primarily ate plant-based diet and didn't
*  and animal products were not a significant part of our diet through evolution, then yes,
*  that's what I'm saying.
*  It depends.
*  So we came from the equator, right?
*  I want to go back a second because...
*  You don't need to answer the question.
*  Are you arguing that there's a dominant consensus among nutrition experts in the US that everyone
*  should be on a vegan diet?
*  No.
*  So what's the argument here?
*  People should eat plants?
*  And my argument is yes, they should.
*  And animal products can also be part of that nutrivor, healthy omnivorous diet.
*  And I think you would find a dominant consensus of nutrition experts that agree with that.
*  But that's not the way this film is being interpreted.
*  Right, because there was a bias going into it.
*  So for example, when you go to the US military, right, The Game Changers is the first documentary
*  that has ever been accredited by the Defense Health Agency for the Department of Defense.
*  It's the first documentary that has ever been supported by the Special Operations Medical
*  Association.
*  They didn't come into it looking at the science.
*  This has been evaluated by hundreds of PhD researchers to come to that conclusion.
*  They did not come into it.
*  Wait a minute.
*  How so?
*  They've been evaluated how so?
*  You can't get an accreditation.
*  Your film has been evaluated by...
*  The Defense Health Agency of the Department of Defense, which decides what the military
*  is eating, they don't give a crap about, oh, let's base our diets on evolution.
*  They care on what is the science.
*  And The Game Changers is the first documentary that's ever been accredited by the Defense
*  Health Agency.
*  They didn't look at this and go, okay, this is a vegan propaganda film.
*  Why are you saying that hundreds of PhDs have reviewed this and reviewed all the data in
*  it to come to this conclusion?
*  And is this proven?
*  Is this printed?
*  Is this some published paper where it shows that hundreds of people have reviewed this
*  film and found all the claims to be credible and that all the debunkings of it are not?
*  The Defense Health Agency has reviewed this film in detail, digging into each of the studies.
*  Right, but you're saying, again, call to authority.
*  You're saying hundreds of PhDs have studied this.
*  Who are these people?
*  Yes.
*  Well, there's a lot from the Defense Health Agency.
*  There's a lot of people at Special Operations Medical Association that came to the decision.
*  PhDs and master's degrees in nutrition, PhDs in nutrition to get that accreditation.
*  That just hasn't happened before because they didn't come into it thinking this is a vegan
*  propaganda film.
*  That was the bias going into it.
*  We're again talking a lot about experts and their opinions.
*  Experts, right.
*  Experts and their opinions and not Chris Kresser and his opinion.
*  It's not.
*  That's an extra representation, James.
*  No, this is not about my opinion.
*  We can fill the room with experts who agree with me.
*  You had an expert, a debate with a doctor in the UK on a TV show who disagreed with
*  you.
*  We can always find people who agree and disagree with all kinds of different credentials.
*  It's disingenuous to claim, like I said, that I'm not here to argue that plants are unhealthy
*  and that we shouldn't be eating a lot of plants.
*  This is the fallacy that gets created with these kinds of films.
*  It's not a choice between a standard American crappy processed food diet that contains meat
*  or a vegan diet.
*  There is a possibility of a plant-based diet, a diet that has a lot of plants that also
*  contains animal products.
*  Comparing that with a 100% plant-based diet, that is the operative question here.
*  I believe that meat and dairy are bad for you.
*  The film talked about plant-based diets.
*  Why do you believe that?
*  I think there's sufficient evidence.
*  Well, let's talk about that.
*  Because that's what we already started talking about.
*  If you look at our website and people want resources on what to eat, we say it's all
*  or something.
*  It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
*  We were talking about plant-based diets.
*  That's nice, but what you just said, you think that meat is bad for you.
*  Yeah.
*  Meat and dairy.
*  Yeah, let's go.
*  I can see the argument if we're talking about two-thirds of people being lactose intolerant.
*  I would see the argument that for two-thirds of people, dairy is probably not good for
*  you.
*  The research doesn't support that, though.
*  But if you're saying, what is lactose intolerant?
*  If you're intolerant of something, it means your body's not enjoying it.
*  And that's not the only issue, by the way.
*  That's not the only issue with milk.
*  But let's just concentrate on that because that's a giant number.
*  Two-thirds of people are lactose intolerant.
*  Your body's intolerant of something, but you keep consuming that thing that your body's
*  intolerant of.
*  I would naturally assume as an absolute admitted non-expert that that's not good.
*  So two things here.
*  Number one, I've always for years have written that dairy is very individual and depends
*  on your tolerance.
*  Number two, there are a lot of dairy products with virtually no lactose in them.
*  So cheese, for example, hard cheeses, no lactose.
*  Cream, very little lactose.
*  Butter, no lactose.
*  Ghee, no lactose.
*  No-gurt fermented dairy products like kefir, no lactose.
*  So while I agree with what you're saying, if someone is lactose intolerant, they should
*  avoid dairy products that contain lactose.
*  When you look at the studies on dairy and connections with conditions like cancer, inflammation,
*  which I just pointed out with this study, and you look at cardiometabolic outcomes,
*  which I'd like to cover because that includes heart disease and diabetes and overweight,
*  etc.
*  There is not any strong evidence that dairy contributes to those conditions.
*  So let's look at those actual studies.
*  So Chris, you talk really badly against epidemiology trying to prove causation, and then when you
*  like it, you cite it.
*  So you'll give epidemiological evidence.
*  It's the same way with you, James.
*  I mean, you can't have it both ways.
*  Exactly.
*  You can't have it both ways either.
*  That's right.
*  So you can, if the burden of proof, if you're claiming that something is bad for you, the
*  burden of proof is on you.
*  Sure.
*  Meaning, so you can't say it's bad for you, and then I show epidemiological studies and
*  RCTs, by the way, that were included in that meta-analyses that don't support that, and
*  then you say, oh, we can't trust the research.
*  No, I'm saying, I'm pointing out your hypocrisy is saying that you said that epidemiology,
*  that's observational studies, just looking at people.
*  You have said that we can't rely on those, and then you then cite them yourself.
*  I didn't say we can't rely on epidemiology.
*  I say you have to consider the caveats with epidemiology.
*  But again, the burden of proof, if you're claiming that a food is bad for you, the burden
*  of proof is on you to show research that it is.
*  So for example, if I then show a...
*  I'm going to give you some time, I'll give you a couple of reasons about meat.
*  So for example, first of all, there's inflammatory mediators, for example, like heme iron.
*  Second of all, we look at population data and we show increased causes of morbidity and
*  mortality for people that eat less meat or that eat no meat.
*  So there's...
*  Increased causes of morbidity, you just said it the wrong way.
*  Yeah, so decreased risk of morbidity and mortality.
*  Let's just be real clear on that because you said it wrong, just so that everybody...
*  Heme iron, for example.
*  Let's look at two randomized controlled trials.
*  These are not observational studies.
*  The first found that increasing red meat consumption by replacing carbohydrates in the diet of
*  individuals without anemia actually reduced markers of inflammation.
*  Sorry, reducing, replacing what, sorry?
*  Carbohydrates?
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what you said, sorry.
*  So, Jamie, if you want to pull this...
*  I mean, these are all on the website, kresser.co.
*  slash game changers, but that study is called increased lean red meat intake does not elevate
*  markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans.
*  I believe the study exists.
*  I mean, that doesn't...
*  These are two RCTs, randomized.
*  So they're actually controlling it instead of just looking at observational data, which
*  is subject to healthy user bias.
*  Which is epidemiology studies.
*  So that's one study.
*  And then there's another one, another RCT in women with anemia inflammation markers on
*  a diet high in red meat were not significantly different from those on a diet high in oily
*  fish.
*  And then there are also numerous studies of paleo diets, but which contain meat and other
*  types of animal protein and show that they decrease markers of inflammation, including
*  CRP.
*  There's randomized controlled trials showing reductions in interleukin-6 and also in tumor
*  necrosis factor alpha in these diets.
*  So all of this suggests it's not the meat, it's what you eat with the meat that makes
*  the difference.
*  We have studies of eating chlorophyll-rich green vegetables decreases the formation of
*  N-nitroso compounds with meat.
*  We have lots of studies showing that when you eat plants along with the meat, then you
*  don't see the effects that you might see if you're just eating a crap standard American
*  diet.
*  I agree.
*  So it offsets...
*  So if an animal foods creates oxidative stress, you have it with the plant foods and that
*  would have the antioxidant and that would offset it.
*  Is that basically...
*  It's a little more complicated than that.
*  Yeah, I think it is more complicated than that.
*  But that's one mechanism.
*  As I said last time and as I've always argued, I'm not a proponent of the carnivore diet.
*  I'm not a low carb guy.
*  I'm not a keto guy.
*  My fundamental argument is just that the optimal human diet contains both plant and animal
*  foods.
*  And this focus on individual food components or macronutrients like protein or fat or carbohydrate,
*  we've gotten too much.
*  It's called nutritionism.
*  It's just focusing on these individual elements and ignoring the overall pattern of diet quality,
*  which is the most important thing.
*  And that's what a lot of the more recent studies are showing.
*  When you look at the diet pattern and the diet quality on its own, you know, overall,
*  that's what actually makes a difference in terms of health and lifespan, not how much
*  of this fat, how much of that fat, whether there's, you know, red meat or white meat
*  or fish or whatever.
*  It's the pattern.
*  Let me pause here because this is one of the primary misconceptions that people have about
*  consuming meat.
*  When they hear studies that say that meat is associated with mortality or high cholesterol
*  or heart disease or all these different factors, we are talking about these kinds of studies
*  where people fill out a form, tell us what you eat.
*  How many days a week do you eat meat?
*  How many days a week do you eat this?
*  What they don't take into account is whether or not these people are going to Wendy's,
*  whether or not they're eating a grass-fed steak and, you know, broccoli, something healthy.
*  There's a giant difference between those two things, but they're lumped in together because
*  this is meat consumption.
*  Yeah, the studies aren't perfect for sure.
*  But you were saying that basically you're saying we should look at outcomes and not
*  just look at individual markers, right?
*  Is that basically?
*  No, I'm saying we should look at the diet quality, the overall diet pattern.
*  So for example, Christopher Gardner did a study at Stanford a couple years ago and he
*  took two, instead of saying, you know, low fat, low carb, he took two groups and he advised
*  them all to basically eat a healthy diet.
*  And then one group ate a low fat healthy diet and the other group ate a low carb healthy
*  diet.
*  They all lost weight.
*  But there wasn't that big of a difference between the two.
*  I agree.
*  So first of all, in terms of health, I would be pretty, my opinion would be I'm pretty
*  much macronutrient agnostic.
*  So I wouldn't like, I'm not advocating high carb or low carb.
*  I think that people can do healthy and well.
*  I think for athletes, they need a lot more carbs, which of course, getting those from
*  plants.
*  I think there's certain athletes that can, if it's slow and steady state where you're
*  getting more fat oxidation, I think that, you know, stone steady state athletes can
*  do.
*  But like an MMA fighter, a soccer player, a basketball player, more carbs.
*  We all agree on that.
*  But you just said that you were not low carb, right?
*  You said you're not low carb.
*  I'm not.
*  I'm not a low carb advocate.
*  I've written articles called Seven Reasons You Should Be Cautious.
*  I'm not saying I'm not a low carb advocate.
*  I don't believe everyone should be on a low carb diet.
*  I've never believed that.
*  But the thing is, Chris has his own, he doesn't have the consensus definitions of carbohydrate
*  levels.
*  You've made up your own definitions, right?
*  When did I make up my own definition?
*  Slide 80.
*  Jamie, if you could do that, please.
*  I just point out that Zach Bitter, the man who I had on the podcast yesterday, who holds
*  the world record in running 100 miles in 11 hours, and I think it's 18 minutes, he's on
*  a low carbohydrate diet.
*  Yeah.
*  And again, those slow and steady state, you can certainly do well.
*  So, Chris, your recommendation, your definition of low carb is 10 to 15%.
*  If you can go to the next slide, Jamie, 81.
*  So, if you look at the peer-reviewed literature, it's either less than 30% or, in the next
*  slide, Jamie, less than 40%.
*  Like, if you look across all the literatures, less than 30 or 40.
*  Moderate carb, according to Chris, next slide, Jamie, would be 15 to 30.
*  Peer-reviewed literature, next slide, 40 to 65.
*  And then high carb, Chris calls more than 30%.
*  And the peer-reviewed literature, high carb, more than 65.
*  And the next slide, more than 70, depending on the peer-reviewed literature.
*  So you've come up with your own definitions of what is low, moderate, and high carb.
*  Yeah, just for the purpose of my work with people.
*  I wasn't trying to represent research there.
*  That's what I consider to be low carb, moderate carb, and high carb in my work with patients
*  and in my recommendations.
*  Joe, did you not just hear him say...
*  He did, I mean, that is what you said.
*  I mean, when you wrote this out, you did have a different definition than the peer-reviewed
*  literature.
*  So to go slide 88.
*  Slide 88.
*  You do, by his definition, have your own idea of what high carb and low carb is.
*  And he said no.
*  You heard him say no.
*  Yes.
*  And so slide 88, please, Jamie.
*  So I just want to sum this up.
*  But what's the point here?
*  Because the point is...
*  I've never said that everyone should be on a low carb diet.
*  No, I agree.
*  I've always argued that it depends on everything from your genes to your exercise pattern and
*  activity...
*  Where, Chris, where are you getting your numbers from?
*  Like when you write low carb, moderate carb, and high carb?
*  He made them up.
*  This is just a...
*  This is a clinical recommendation from my experience working with patients.
*  I'm not representing the scientific literature here.
*  I'm not trying to make arguments about what's safe or not safe.
*  We're talking about nutrition.
*  That's madness.
*  That's absolute madness to come up with your own definitions.
*  And this is what I feel that Chris does.
*  And when you have people like Chris on multiple times, it throws people's perception off as
*  what is a healthy diet.
*  Because Chris misrepresents the data.
*  He comes up with his own definitions of things.
*  He misrepresents things that we said in the film.
*  Okay?
*  What did I misrepresent in the film?
*  Hold on.
*  We're going to get into the woods here.
*  Let's just talk about this real quick.
*  So when we're talking about low carb, moderate carb, or high carb, when you're recommending
*  patients, low carb, moderate carb, or high carb, these definitions, how are you coming
*  to these conclusions?
*  Just made them up.
*  No, based on...
*  So there are a lot of people, James, that disagree with the ranges in...
*  The scientific consensus.
*  Yeah, there are.
*  But when you say scientific consensus, how many different scientists were polled on this?
*  How many different studies were shown?
*  I don't know.
*  Just consider...
*  But hold on a second.
*  Is this something that you just found that disputes his position?
*  Or is this like a large group of people?
*  No, this is...
*  Okay, so slide 89.
*  Well, consider Virta Health, who uses...
*  You know the folks at Virta, who are all scientists, MDs.
*  They use a ketogenic, very low carb diet to address diabetes.
*  You will not be in ketosis at 30% carbohydrate, or 25%, or 20%, or even 15%.
*  For ketosis, you need low carb.
*  Probably less than 10%.
*  I agree.
*  I don't think that's...
*  So, you know, that...
*  And then, you know, 40 to 65%, you're not even in the ballpark, you know?
*  For moderate carb, right?
*  So, if you're thinking about using low carbohydrate diets, for example, for weight loss, or for
*  diabetes, or, you know, metabolic issues like Virta Health is doing, then low carb is not
*  going to be 30 to 40%.
*  Okay, that makes sense.
*  Like, that's not going to work.
*  So, that's where my recommendations are coming from.
*  Your recommendation is based on ketosis?
*  Based on...
*  No, based on the optimal range, if you have...
*  If you look at the rest of the article, it's going to be like, if you've got diabetes,
*  you're overweight, you're obese, you're trying to lose weight.
*  This is the range that I've found, and other experts, like the people at Virta Health,
*  have found will be most effective.
*  And these are the ranges...
*  There's no representation that this is the range that is defined as low carb in the scientific
*  literature.
*  So, you're calling it low carb because if someone's on a ketogenic, low carb diet, in
*  order to get into ketosis, you have to have a low number of carbohydrates.
*  It's actually probably even below 10%.
*  Not even just to be in ketosis.
*  Just to get the maximal weight loss.
*  Someone could be at 15% and still get great weight loss without being in ketosis.
*  I've got to interrupt because just in the last five minutes, you showed a study from
*  trying to prove your own point that low carb and low fat people had equivalent fat loss.
*  You just said that.
*  So, why are you now all of a sudden advocating only low carb diets for losing body fat?
*  I'm not advocating only low carb diets.
*  I said that they can both work for different people in different situations.
*  But James, you're misrepresenting what he was saying.
*  What he was saying is getting people to go on a healthy diet versus the standard American
*  diet.
*  So, he's not just talking about low carb versus high carb.
*  What he's talking about is getting off bullshit like processed foods and sugar and eating
*  healthy.
*  I totally agree with that.
*  And when you do that, people, no matter what, low carb or high carb lose weight.
*  But I think you will agree, as well as almost anybody would, that getting on a low carb,
*  high carbohydrate diet and forcing your body into ketosis makes your body burn fat.
*  It's one way, yeah.
*  But it's proven, right?
*  The other piece of this is most of the studies aren't comparing a healthy omnivorous diet
*  with a plant-based vegan diet.
*  They're comparing a vegan diet with a standard American diet that contains animal products.
*  Same with the Paleo diet, so is NutriVore diet.
*  Which by the way, has any of your work or your ideas been published in the scientific
*  literature?
*  No, I've never claimed that they did not have.
*  I just wondered.
*  So...
*  You didn't wonder.
*  No, I did wonder.
*  I couldn't find anything.
*  But that's not why you were saying that.
*  You were saying that to try to make it seem that he's less of an expert.
*  Well, he is.
*  I'm not an expert either.
*  So what's the point?
*  Why are you here?
*  Why am I here?
*  Well, actually I did ask if I could bring my chief science advisor who has a double
*  master's degree in exercise physiology and nutrition.
*  He's a registered dietitian.
*  He built one of these.
*  I've read all his papers and we can talk about them.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  But I think we should...
*  So first of all, we just...
*  We still haven't come to this understanding of why you think meat is bad for you.
*  You are basing it...
*  Well, okay, so there's the individual components like heme iron, for example.
*  We talked about that last time.
*  Heme iron is only associated with poor outcomes in the US.
*  It's not in other countries.
*  That's actually not true.
*  That's actually not true.
*  That's actually not true.
*  That's actually not true.
*  Let's let him and then we can refute it.
*  That's not true.
*  You can refute it.
*  Hold on.
*  In the FANG meta-analysis, which looks at most of the studies that have been done on
*  that, and then if you also consider that when you add green vegetables and other plant foods,
*  spices and all of that, it reduces the oxidative capacity of heme iron and reduces the absorption
*  of heme iron.
*  And again, we're talking about diet pattern, not just are you eating red meat in McDonald's
*  and fast food restaurants, but are you eating it in the context of an overall healthy diet?
*  And does that have the same effect?
*  Right.
*  Do you know how do you read a forest plot?
*  Yes or no?
*  I don't.
*  What does that mean?
*  That's basically looking at the confident intervals.
*  What's it called?
*  A forest plot.
*  A forest plot.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah, because it kind of looks like a bunch of trees, right?
*  Okay.
*  So you don't know how to read a forest plot.
*  So have you actually looked at the study that you referenced?
*  I have looked at the study.
*  Okay, so I just read on how to read it.
*  So it's kind of ... So get a microphone on you, James.
*  Just pull that sucker over.
*  So you see that ... First of all, he said that what he put up on the screen, I don't
*  know if you've still got the slide, but you said that the heme iron association was only
*  in Americans, right?
*  But the conclusion of that study said that heme iron was associated with cardiovascular
*  disease.
*  That was the conclusion of the study, which he didn't put up on the screen.
*  Okay?
*  And then, second of all ...
*  The quote I put up was, with respect to heme iron intake, we found a significant association
*  only in the studies that were based on American cohorts.
*  Right.
*  So there's two things about that.
*  That was from the study.
*  Okay, first thing, I can't link to my slide.
*  I don't know where it is.
*  But basically, can you just read the conclusion of that study?
*  Because I can't find my slide.
*  The conclusion is down here.
*  Higher dietary intake of heme iron is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,
*  whereas no association was found between cardiovascular disease and non-heme iron intake or total iron
*  intake.
*  Okay.
*  And then also ...
*  And then I just read the quote just now that ...
*  Right, which was incorrect, by the way.
*  The authors made a mistake.
*  Oh.
*  How did they make a mistake?
*  So if you look at this forest plot, for example, this Kipstein-Grobusch ... And you can go
*  and look at the ... I've looked at the individual studies that they were referencing in the
*  meta-analysis, as has my scientific team.
*  So basically, you see this is a 1.86, with the constant interval being 1.14 to 3.09.
*  Okay?
*  That is statistically significant connection between heme iron.
*  And you can look at the conclusions in three of the studies.
*  But you're saying that what he said about eating it with green leafy vegetables reduces
*  the abstinence effects?
*  No, no, no.
*  But we have to point out that he ... I don't think this one ...
*  You don't think that's true?
*  No.
*  First of all, unlike the dairy one, where I think that he was being a bit misleading,
*  in this case, I don't think he was being misleading.
*  I think that you read ...
*  There was no misleading.
*  It was summarizing ... We already went over this.
*  Yeah, I don't think he was being misleading in the dairy.
*  You would like to create that impression, but there was no misleading.
*  That's just my opinion.
*  I think you were being a bit misleading.
*  In this case, I do not think he was being misleading at all.
*  It did say what you said in the study, even though you didn't point out the conclusion.
*  You left out the conclusion of the study.
*  But what wasn't your fault is I think you read the study, but you admitted that you
*  don't know how to read forest plots.
*  The forest plots, if you did look at them and you knew how to read them, you'd show
*  that there were three in the Netherlands and in Sweden that did show a significant correlation.
*  What you were trying to make out with this point, which I understand when you have a
*  point of view and you're trying to work it backwards, what you end up doing is you try
*  and find studies that suit your position.
*  You went and found the study and you found a quote, even though you didn't like to put
*  the conclusion of the study.
*  No, I did say that there was an association, but it was based on American cohorts.
*  Yeah, but it's not.
*  It's not your fault because the people who ever wrote the write-up for the study made
*  a mistake.
*  They were statistically significant because 1.14 to 3 means that there was like a 14%
*  to 300% increase in that one study from the Netherlands, the Kirsten Klipsten-Grobusch.
*  For people watching, they can go and look at the study, look at the conclusions.
*  There were three because his point was what you tried to infer from that was that the
*  American diet that includes a bunch of junk food is different than the ones in Sweden
*  and the Netherlands where they aren't eating so much junk food, but that actually was incorrect.
*  So heme iron has been associated and is recognized.
*  Yes, it has been associated and we still have the studies that eating fruits and vegetables
*  attenuate the oxidative capacity from heme iron, reduce absorption of iron in the gut.
*  And now we're focusing on a single mechanism rather than looking at the outcomes.
*  Right, which I, again, I'm happy to look at the outcomes.
*  Do you agree with what he just said though?
*  I do.
*  That heme iron...
*  I think that plant foods offset the oxidation, offset in some regard the oxidation that you
*  get from animal foods.
*  However, if you work out you have oxidative stress, okay?
*  So if you want to have a meal, do you want the plant foods in the meal to be dealing
*  with the oxidative stress from the animal foods or do you want the plants to deal with
*  the oxidative stress, allow you to recover faster and your next workout will be better?
*  I don't think we know that's true.
*  No, we do know that's true.
*  We don't know that that's true.
*  How do we know that that's true?
*  That's very specific.
*  No, no, no.
*  That's very specific.
*  This is nutritionism because we're not focusing on the nutrients in red meat and the things
*  that, and the highly bioavailable protein.
*  It's not like red meat is only there to cause, is causing oxidative stress.
*  I agree.
*  It's not the only thing.
*  There are some nutrients in meat.
*  So again, the question is, is there a place for animal foods in a diet that is healthy
*  overall?
*  Right.
*  Not whether you should eat plant foods.
*  Right.
*  We both agree that you should probably eat a lot of plant foods, right?
*  Which is my position.
*  I think it would be difficult for me to argue 100% plants versus 50% plants.
*  I don't think it's argued to argue like 90, 95% plants versus, I think the argument would
*  take hours and hours and hours to convince you why I think 100% plants is better.
*  I think there's definitely bio variability and I think different people have different
*  requirements.
*  Can we just go back a second?
*  I want to make sure I understood what you just said.
*  Can you repeat that?
*  So my position is that the literature, I think it's an easier argument because we're talking
*  about plant-based diets and plant-based diets would do either limiting or eliminating animal
*  products, right?
*  So for plant-based diets in general, right?
*  So vegan, maybe some vegetarian, like if you eat turkey on Thanksgiving and then you
*  eat fish once a month, I would say that's a plant-based diet.
*  You're getting the vast majority of calories from plants, right?
*  And I think there's a lot.
*  Well, I think most people, even if you're eating pasta, you're getting the vast majority
*  of your calories from plants.
*  Well, yeah, but if we're talking about what's a healthy, the healthiest diet.
*  But that's the problem, right?
*  I think whole plant foods, right?
*  But a lot of shitty American diet is plant-based.
*  You're talking about buns and bread and all the bullshit and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
*  That's all plant-based.
*  And a lot of vegans and vegetarians, just because you're vegan or vegetarian doesn't
*  mean you're healthy.
*  Exactly.
*  Right?
*  My argument would be you should get the vast majority of your calories from whole plant
*  foods.
*  Right.
*  Agreed.
*  Okay.
*  You agree?
*  Well, I don't think the vast majority is my position, but I think that's his position.
*  I agree with what he's saying.
*  I think that, look, I eat animal products.
*  I have for a long time.
*  And I eat a lot of vegetables as well.
*  I think that an omnivorous diet is the key to health.
*  That's what I believe.
*  Yeah.
*  I believe that meat helps you recover faster.
*  I think it's more nutrient-rich.
*  I think there's things in meat that it's very difficult to get in plants.
*  And I think the quality of the amino acids and the quality of the protein content in
*  meat is superior to that in plants.
*  I definitely would suggest the protein.
*  Let's talk about that, because that's one of the things you brought up.
*  Can I just say that I agree with the type of meat that you eat?
*  We know that there's not studies done on the inflammation in elk, but there is studies
*  on inflammation in kangaroos, for example, in Australia.
*  So totally wild-caught.
*  That's their equivalent of elk, right?
*  And there is about half the inflammation coming from that as there is from beef.
*  Well, I would imagine.
*  I mean, you're talking about a much healthier, much higher protein.
*  The difference between the protein content in elk per ounce versus the protein content
*  in beef is almost double.
*  It's a giant difference.
*  I've just had randomized controlled trials that showed less inflammation with eating
*  red meat.
*  Yes.
*  No, yeah, but the thing is, it's tricky.
*  Because when it's something healthier or something inflammatory, it's always compared to what?
*  So in some of these studies, what the industry does is they'll compare red meat to bacon,
*  or they'll switch it up.
*  It's always to what?
*  It works the other way around.
*  They compare a plant-based diet with a standard crop Western diet.
*  No, I agree.
*  That's not a good comparison.
*  I still don't see why you're saying meat is bad for you.
*  Well, so, I mean, we just showed with the heme iron.
*  But the heme iron in conjunction with plant-based foods is showing it offsets it.
*  And he said it's because of the quote that you gave is that one of the primary reasons
*  is because of oxidation.
*  Antioxidants deal with oxidation.
*  You get pro-oxidation from animal foods.
*  You also get pro-oxidation from exercise.
*  We're talking about isolated mechanisms instead of outcomes.
*  But Chris, you talk about mechanisms when you want to, and you talk about pre-clinical
*  data when you want to.
*  I was talking about them in response to the claims made in the film, because mechanisms
*  were mentioned.
*  New 5GC, TMAO, heme iron.
*  And so I brought those up to respond to them.
*  No, but that's not when you use them.
*  Because if you go on your website, you actually...
*  I'm not saying we shouldn't ever talk about mechanisms, James.
*  If you're talking about mechanisms but the outcomes don't support the mechanism, then
*  what's the point?
*  Well, I think we can get into epidemiology and look at that.
*  But I think we should definitely hit protein, because I think of everyone watching, that's
*  the biggest myth and it's the biggest gripe.
*  And I think we should definitely hit B12.
*  So I want to make sure we...
*  Let's go with B12, because one of the things that you said that he disputed was...
*  Bring up that B12 quote that you said was complete horseshit.
*  I can read it out if you want.
*  Go ahead, please.
*  B12 is this...
*  If you disagree with what you were critiquing.
*  B12 isn't made...
*  I'll read the whole thing and then...
*  So B12 isn't made by animals, it's made by bacteria that these animals consume in the
*  soil and water.
*  Just like with protein, animals are only the middlemen.
*  Before industrial farming, farm animals and humans could get B12 by eating traces of dirt
*  on plant foods or by drinking water from rivers or streams.
*  But now, because pesticides, antibiotics and chlorine kill the bacteria that produce this
*  Even fine animals have to be given B12 supplements.
*  And you said that's just all false, that's all just factually wrong.
*  So first of all, B12 is made by bacteria, but animals don't get it from consuming soil
*  and water.
*  First of all, you misrepresented what I said.
*  So I said it's made by bacteria that these animals consume.
*  You went on to say that animals didn't get bacteria from the soil.
*  That's not what I said.
*  They didn't get it from the bacteria that they got from the soil.
*  So you misrepresented what I said.
*  The key claims you made, James, is that it used to be possible to get B12 by eating dirt
*  on plant foods or from drinking water from rivers or streams.
*  I still have not seen convincing evidence that that is true.
*  And Jack Norris, a vegan dietician, has admitted as much in his article.
*  And then even more relevant than all of that is looking at B12 deficiency rates between
*  vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores in the clinical literature.
*  Like the other stuff is not really relevant until you get to the clinical effect.
*  Can we address each of your critiques then?
*  Is that okay?
*  Yeah.
*  So first of all, you said there's zero evidence that B12 is fed to cattle, right?
*  You said that.
*  So can I just...
*  First, you represented, because I said even farm animals...
*  Can you put up slide 44, please, Jamie?
*  I said even farm animals have to be given B12 supplements.
*  That's what I said.
*  Okay?
*  So did you mean all farm animals?
*  Okay.
*  So do you see that?
*  That is a screen cap from the film.
*  That's a chicken.
*  And down at the bottom, there's the quote for the poultry, right?
*  So would you disagree that pigs and chickens and other farms...
*  No, I don't disagree that they sometimes get B12, but do...
*  Do you...
*  What about shellfish?
*  Shellfish are extremely high in B12.
*  They're the highest, even higher than...
*  That's a total non-sequitur and it's a short-margin.
*  It's not, actually, because the implication in the film was the only reason you get B12
*  from eating animal products is because they're given B12 supplements.
*  So are you really suggesting that the population gets most of its B12 from shellfish?
*  No.
*  Okay, thank you.
*  The claim that animals need to take B12 supplements in order to have B12 in their flesh is not
*  accurate.
*  So where do you think chickens get it from?
*  James.
*  Where do you think chickens get their B12 from?
*  The point about the shellfish was I never claimed chicken was a great source of B12.
*  I said in the film, even farm animals have to be given B12 supplements.
*  You said that it was absolutely false.
*  Everything that I said about B12, you said was absolutely false.
*  Those are your words.
*  Also, you talking about that people used to be able to get it from consuming vegetables
*  with that bacteria and dirt on it and that the water is now because of pesticides and
*  chlorine, the water no longer has B12 in it.
*  And then you claim that the same percentage of...
*  You picked one study that showed equal rates of deficiency and ignored the huge amount
*  of literature that shows big differences between vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores in terms
*  of B12 deficiency.
*  I know all of your critiques because I've noted them and I've got a point for each one.
*  So can I just go to them?
*  Sure.
*  And then if you disagree, you can...
*  So could you just...
*  Jamie, could you put up slide 45?
*  And rather than throwing off track going to about humans, we'll get to that in a second.
*  But that...
*  I mean, B12 is just commonly fed to chickens and you would agree with that, right?
*  And pigs and lambs that feel...
*  Like ruminants can create B12 in their gut from the bacteria that they eat.
*  But you brought up cattle.
*  And bivalves and other fish.
*  Yeah, no, certainly.
*  There's some.
*  Yeah, but that's not...
*  Yeah, totally.
*  Okay.
*  So since you brought up cattle, you said that cattle...
*  There's no evidence of cattle being fed B12.
*  So if you bring up slide 46...
*  Vitamin B12 for sheep and cattle, that's what it says.
*  You said there's no evidence.
*  So you said there's no evidence.
*  So on the left, just so...
*  Because people might not be able to read the small print.
*  Well, listen, there's people just listening as well.
*  Okay, sorry, for people just listening.
*  So B12 injection for sheep and cattle.
*  There's three different products that are shown here.
*  There's something that's added to feed on the left.
*  So it says, a liquid complementary feeding stuff containing the essential trace elements,
*  cobalt, selenium, and B12.
*  As for the treatment of B12 deficiencies.
*  Correct.
*  That's due to some soils being low in cobalt.
*  Which is a lot of...
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So now if you just go to slide 47.
*  Please, Jamie.
*  Next slide.
*  Okay.
*  This is the largest supplier of animal feed or supplements in the world.
*  Okay?
*  On their website.
*  Young ruminants require supplemental vitamin B12 prior to full rumen development.
*  They also say vitamin D is sometimes administered perentarily to incoming feedlot cattle.
*  And also B12, by the way, has been shown to increase milk production.
*  You said there was no evidence that cattle are given B12.
*  And you said that all my statements were absolutely false.
*  Do you at least admit that you were wrong there?
*  If I said that...
*  I've got your quote.
*  That cattle, specifically that one portion of the statement that there's no evidence
*  that cattle ever get B12 supplements, then I was wrong about that.
*  Read what he says.
*  Okay.
*  First of all, when I made the full statement, this is what you first said.
*  That's just all false.
*  That's all just factually wrong.
*  And then later on you said, there's also zero evidence that B12 is fed to cattle.
*  That is flat out wrong, and I have just shown that.
*  Is that fair?
*  Yeah.
*  I was wrong about that.
*  Okay.
*  So we'll get to other points because you were wrong about many other things as well.
*  Okay.
*  So, let's see.
*  So you agree that it is fed to cattle, so you want to look at humans.
*  I'm just trying to see if there's any other points that you brought up.
*  I've been giving minerals and feed and different things to cattle, particularly because of
*  the grain diets.
*  The point, if cattle are deficient because they're in a feedlot where they're not eating
*  grass.
*  It's not only that.
*  And that's the primary reason.
*  It isn't only that?
*  Or because soils have become...
*  So young cows...
*  Right, but these are young cows that are most likely being in feedlot.
*  And people have been getting B12 from animals.
*  Do you dispute that the primary source of B12 for human beings has been eating animals
*  and also fish and shellfish?
*  In history?
*  And from rivers and streams and dirt?
*  In history.
*  Both.
*  Both.
*  Wait, where is the evidence that rivers and streams and dirt has been a primary source
*  of B12?
*  I'm obviously going to give it to you.
*  You think I came here today.
*  You think I made claims in the film that I couldn't back up?
*  Perhaps.
*  Because there are quite a few claims.
*  We went over those in the last show.
*  Can we stick with the B12?
*  Sure.
*  Okay.
*  So, can we just go to slide 48?
*  Hold on a second, please.
*  B12 concentration fluctuated between 100 and 2000.
*  So this is in levels of water in the English Lake District.
*  If you want to go to slide 49.
*  The vegetables were eaten without being carefully washed.
*  Thus, strict vegetarians who do not practice hand washing or vegetable cleaning may be
*  untroubled by vitamin B12 of deficiency.
*  And by the way, the retained vitamin D12 of soil was adequate to prevent B12 of deficiency.
*  So what you're essentially saying is that we're dealing with B12 that was in soil and
*  then in water and that by the chlorination and filtration systems that we use today,
*  that's what's ruining the water and the water does not have the B12 in it anymore.
*  We sanitize water now, which is a good thing.
*  Yes, but that also takes out the B12.
*  Sure.
*  So that makes your statement correct.
*  So he was wrong again.
*  That's not the consensus view that you can get enough B12 from eating unwashed vegetables.
*  No, no.
*  He didn't necessarily say that was the consensus view.
*  What he said in the statement was that the reason why we no longer have B12 in the water
*  and in the soil is because of the fact that they add chlorines and pesticides and it seems
*  like there's evidence to back that up.
*  So again, people have questioned, did I spend a thousand hours?
*  Now that I'm giving you the facts, do you question that I spent a thousand hours?
*  I've spent another 2000 hours looking at peer-reviewed research since then.
*  If you say you have, I have no reason to disbelieve.
*  It's a lot of time.
*  It's a lot of time.
*  A thousand hours is a lot of time.
*  Like what was it?
*  Lane Norton said that you should probably have gotten a PhD.
*  I think, well, I don't think that's the case.
*  I think there's people a lot smarter than me that are making these scientific conclusions.
*  But I mean that amount of hours of research, you literally...
*  I've estimated that I've done, conservative estimate I've done since then about 3000 hours
*  because once I started making the film and doing that, then I didn't.
*  Anyway.
*  I believe you.
*  There are also B12 analogs in the soil that aren't absorbed and utilized like true B12.
*  Oh great.
*  But again, you don't...
*  But they...
*  Can we admit the two things that you've touched on so far, you got wrong?
*  I mean, it's not likely that it's proven that cattle do receive B12 under whatever circumstances.
*  I don't know whether it's because they're grass-fed or grain-fed.
*  I'm assuming they're feedlot animals that don't get proper nutrients from soil, don't
*  get proper nutrients.
*  I mean, if you're getting these grain-fed, soybean-fed cattle and they're just pouring
*  this dried out shit into a bucket, these animals are not grazing and they're likely deficient
*  in a lot of different things.
*  Sorry.
*  There's also, they've always been supplementing their diet with minerals, supplementing their
*  diet with vitamins.
*  Vitamins.
*  Right, and that's the funny thing.
*  People are like, oh, well, let's just take the extreme end of a plant-based diet, vegans,
*  right?
*  So people say, oh, well, vegans have to take a supplement.
*  Well guess what?
*  You're supplementing anyway.
*  You're just doing it indirectly.
*  If you are eating that kind of animal.
*  About 99% of the beef, for example.
*  Yes, somewhere around there, 97 to 99.
*  Yeah, whatever.
*  So the vast majority.
*  So where, you know, people are getting it, you're supplementing.
*  You're not just supplementing by B12, you're supplementing D in the animal.
*  You're getting it from someone who supplements it in the feed of the animal and then you
*  get it that way.
*  Exactly.
*  Generally not if you're eating grass-fed beef, not if you're eating shellfish, not if you're
*  eating fish.
*  But let's not, you love to point-
*  Grass-fed beef, again, is 1 to 3%.
*  But let's just admit that you made a mistake.
*  Can you just admit that you made a mistake there?
*  About B12.
*  Well, both of those things.
*  B12 in cattle and then you have a third point.
*  So we had the B12 in cattle.
*  You said there was zero evidence about that.
*  You said there was no evidence about being able to get it from water and from dirt, which
*  again, I proved you to be wrong.
*  And the third thing that you said-
*  I said that there's no evidence that humans primarily got their B12 from soil and water,
*  which is what you said in the quote.
*  No, I didn't.
*  You're misrepresenting, again, he's misrepresenting and he's wrong, Joe.
*  You've got to admit that in this case-
*  Well, it's clearly wrong about B12 being given to cattle.
*  We showed three different supplements-
*  This is the main issue.
*  It says before industrial farming, farm animals and humans could get B12 by eating traces
*  of dirt on plant foods or by drinking water from rivers or streams.
*  So you don't think that people will get the idea from hearing that that we never needed
*  to consume animal products to get B12 and we could get plenty from eating soil and water.
*  So where is the evidence for that other than the one study that you showed there?
*  That's because most evidence of vegans, even vegans who are supplementing-
*  These are modern vegans, right?
*  He's talking about something pretty different.
*  He's going off on a track here because he's got two things wrong.
*  I agree with you on this because his statement is essentially saying that the reason why
*  we don't get it today is because of coronation and fluorination of water.
*  We sanitize and we pesticides.
*  Yes.
*  I said this, you took issue with my claim.
*  And up to 39% of people tested, including meat eaters, are low in B12.
*  As a result, the best way for humans to get enough B12, whether they eat animal foods
*  or not, is simply take a supplement.
*  Then you said he didn't provide a reference for that, so it's hard to check.
*  But again, it contradicts mounds of evidence on B12 efficiency.
*  So can you bring up slide 50, please, Jamie?
*  You said that I didn't provide a reference.
*  In the bottom left, where we put all of the references, whenever I made a claim about
*  the scientific research, it's covered by the-
*  It'll go away in a second.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Allegedly.
*  There you go.
*  Okay.
*  So first of all, there's the reference.
*  You claimed you didn't have a reference.
*  Would you admit that you were wrong?
*  Yeah, I missed that.
*  Okay.
*  Three times wrong about B12.
*  Okay.
*  So can we just go into your study, sorry, your e-book on B12.
*  You basically said, I don't know where you got that study from.
*  Your B12 e-book opens with the exact same study.
*  So can you put up slide 51, please, Jamie?
*  Okay.
*  Is that your e-book on the left?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  You rounded up to 40, but I kept it at 39, okay, because I was being specific.
*  B12 efficiency is far more common than most healthcare practitioners and the general public
*  realize.
*  Data from the Tufts University Framing and Offering Study suggests that 40% of people
*  between the ages of 26 and 83 have plasma B12 levels in the low normal range, a range
*  at which many experience neurological symptoms.
*  That was the opening statement of your B12 e-book.
*  And you claimed that where you couldn't find the evidence of that study.
*  No disagreement that B12 deficiency is an issue.
*  I've talked about that on my website.
*  That's not what you said on the last time you were on Joe's podcast.
*  You said, I don't know, he didn't provide a reference for that, so it's hard to reject,
*  but it contradicts the evidence.
*  If that's not reflective of the preponderance of evidence, why did you open your e-book
*  with it?
*  It's not, okay, so there's two different issues here.
*  One is, do omnivores get B12 deficiency?
*  Right, do they?
*  Yes, they do.
*  Okay, and 40% of people tested.
*  In this study.
*  Which is the one that you referenced.
*  That's right.
*  And there are many, I'm not saying the study is bad.
*  I'm just saying let's look at all of the other.
*  I didn't provide a reference, but do you write your own e-books, by the way?
*  I do.
*  And you don't remember that study?
*  No, I write a lot.
*  Okay.
*  James, do you have any idea how many articles I've written over the years?
*  Do you remember every study from every article?
*  I don't know if you write.
*  No, I don't, because I'm a combatives trainer, and that's the thing.
*  Do you not feel like, I'm a combatives trainer, you yourself recognize that you're not a nutrition
*  expert, right?
*  You said that at the beginning.
*  I'm not a nutritionist.
*  I have master's level training in nutrition.
*  So you've got a number of things wrong about B12.
*  There's two issues here.
*  What does that specifically mean, like master's level training in nutrition?
*  Right, thank you, Joe.
*  Well, in California, acupuncturists have a four-year master's program, which includes
*  a lot of medical sciences and nutrition research methodology, et cetera, because we're considered
*  primary care providers in the state of California.
*  So the training is a lot different than it is in other places.
*  So the question of can omnivores develop B12 deficiency?
*  Yes, they can.
*  If you go and look at the rest of the e-book, it's because of things like SIBO, bacterial
*  overgrowth, and the small intestine.
*  Right, and you'll actually accept higher ranges.
*  You'll actually accept higher ranges of what would be considered potentially deficient,
*  right?
*  You'll say like 300, 400 might be deficient.
*  So that would mean that even more people were deficient, right?
*  Now I'm not arguing that vegans can be more deficient than omnivores, but can I just go
*  to slide 52?
*  Can I go to slide 52, please?
*  So what is the question here if you're not arguing that B12 deficiency is more common
*  in vegans and vegetarians?
*  I'm pointing out that you-
*  Because that is what clinically makes the difference.
*  If someone is B12 deficient-
*  I'll get to that.
*  You think I'm not prepared to get to that?
*  I will get to that.
*  You said that the four or five claims that I made about B12 were patently false.
*  I've already pointed out three of the things that you got wrong out of the five.
*  And you are the one that is recommending telling people what to eat.
*  I am a combatives trainer, and my facts in this case are the facts-
*  This doesn't change anything about the facts.
*  Joe, come on.
*  I'm recommending-
*  No, it does because it's really dangerous.
*  What is the recommendation is still that people get enough B12, and that they are less likely
*  to do that on a vegetarian and vegan diet.
*  And there's lots of studies showing that.
*  Can an omnivore develop B12 deficiency?
*  Absolutely.
*  I see it in my practice.
*  And nearly all of the people that-
*  Not the vast majority.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  I didn't say that.
*  The vast majority of that 40% were meat eaters.
*  You referenced- you didn't reference the study, by the way.
*  That's only because there are more meat eaters in the general population.
*  No, I agree.
*  I agree.
*  That has nothing to do with the fact that meat eaters are getting more B12 deficient.
*  I'm not arguing-
*  We've got all of these studies about homocysteine, 9 out of 10 reviews that have shown higher
*  homocysteine levels in vegans, in vegetarians-
*  Joe, can we stick to the point that he made last time, as I'll never get to read it.
*  So when you referenced the framium study, you didn't link to the study.
*  You linked to an article from the USDA about the study.
*  And that study said, oddly, the researchers found no- Again, this is the opening statement
*  of your ebook, references this study.
*  You didn't mention this part.
*  Oddly, the researchers found no association between plasma B12 levels and meat, poultry,
*  and fish intake, even though those foods supply the bulk of B12 in the diet.
*  It's not because people aren't eating enough meat to get the B12, Tucker said.
*  The vitamin isn't getting absorbed.
*  So this backs up my claim that the safest way to get B12 is to take a supplement.
*  Now Crystal just say-
*  So-
*  Can I just finish on this point?
*  Sure.
*  Go ahead.
*  Your claim was, well, people can just go and get- So you agree that- I would say that vegans
*  that don't supplement an omnivore, there's a lot more deficiency in vegans, right?
*  Like it's a nutrient of concern that vegans should be cautious of.
*  I agree with that.
*  That's pretty much universally recognized.
*  That's accepted, right?
*  Yes.
*  So, but even if you don't accept the 40% number, even though you said that-
*  I didn't say I didn't accept that.
*  I didn't-
*  It doesn't matter whether you accept it or not.
*  You've even said that we should consider higher levels B12 deficient, so it would make even
*  more, but that doesn't really matter.
*  The point is that you are saying that- where was I going?
*  Hang on.
*  They're saying the vitamin's not getting absorbed and that B12-
*  Oh, so my point was it's safer to just take a B12 supplement.
*  And for the general population in the world, that is the best recommendation.
*  You'll say you can go to your doctor's and get a $60 blood test and test for B12 and
*  then you can decide whether you need a supplement or not.
*  May I stop you guys both here?
*  Why isn't it getting absorbed?
*  If there is a higher level of vitamin B12 in fish and-
*  There's other factors that inhibit the absorption.
*  So what are those factors?
*  Cibo is one likely possible-
*  Yeah, people's conditions, but also in the food itself.
*  Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine.
*  So, Joe, so basically-
*  We still have the data here-
*  No, no, can I just go back to the argument about- because I said the best, safest way
*  for everyone to get B12 is to take a supplement, right?
*  You say, well, you can just spend $60 and get a blood test, but you've got to recognize
*  that in the world, not everybody can afford $60.
*  Absolutely.
*  Okay, so the safest way to get B12, whether you eat meat or not, is to take a B12 supplement.
*  We know the omnivore-
*  It's the surest way.
*  Let's just all agree on that.
*  It's the surest way.
*  It's the surest way for sure.
*  But then when you've got studies that show 11% of omnivores have B12 depletion versus
*  77% of vegetarians and 92% of vegans, that's with using holotranscobalamin, which is a
*  much more sensitive marker of B12 deficiency than serum B12, which is really problematic.
*  And then you have 9 out of 10 comparisons of homocysteine that found higher levels of
*  homocysteine in vegetarians and omnivores and higher levels in vegans compared to vegetarians.
*  And homocysteine is also a more sensitive marker than serum B12.
*  So there's four stages of B12 deficiency.
*  And serum B12 will only go down out of range in the fourth and final stage of B12 deficiency.
*  So these other studies that I shared on the last show are looking at holotranscobalamin,
*  which was the most sensitive marker of B12 depletion.
*  It's not technically deficiency at that point.
*  And then you have homocysteine and methylmalonic acid that are less sensitive than holotranscobalamin,
*  but more sensitive than serum B12.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Can you bring up slide 54, please?
*  Okay.
*  And I need to show you.
*  Not only have you got all the facts wrong so far about B12 of my claims, you said that
*  they were all false and they weren't false.
*  Every claim that I made so far was backed up by science.
*  And you have admitted that you made mistakes.
*  Okay.
*  So this is your slide.
*  This is your slide, right?
*  Because this is how I can show that he's handpicking these studies to make his claim.
*  You said that 90% of vegans were deficient in-
*  Let's read what it says.
*  It says B12 depletion among omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans.
*  We got to remember that most people are probably listening versus watching.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  So vegans 92%.
*  It says 77, vegetarians 77%, and omnivores 11% for B12 depletion.
*  But that study showed it was more like 40% of depletion.
*  No, that was across the board.
*  I'm not trying to compare the two.
*  Okay.
*  I'm just trying to say your case by using this study is that 92% of vegans are deficient
*  in B12 and omnivores are not-
*  Not deficient.
*  Depleted.
*  Okay.
*  Okay, whatever the number is.
*  I'm not trying to pick apart this study.
*  I agree with the study.
*  Okay.
*  Okay.
*  Can you just go to the next slide, please, Chris?
*  I think it's slide 55.
*  Okay.
*  This is from the study.
*  This is from 16 years ago, by the way, and a very small study from 16 years ago.
*  This is why I show you that he's handpicking the data that he uses.
*  This is where I go back to the fact that it's about the interpretation of the totality of
*  evidence and you can't really rely on someone that's not a nutrition expert handpicking
*  studies to suit their bias.
*  So, this is what he said.
*  In subjects who did not consume vitamins, the levels were what Chris said, right?
*  11% in omnivores, 70% in-
*  So I would agree.
*  If you couldn't get B12 anywhere, you should incorporate some animal foods into your diet.
*  Fair.
*  Okay.
*  But let's look at some other studies.
*  So slide 56.
*  And again, I'm only choosing a few.
*  Certainly they're in my favor.
*  And I'm not saying that vegans don't have lower B12 levels because some people don't
*  But I'm showing that you handpicked a study from 16 years ago.
*  Slide 56.
*  This is a newer study from 2018 with twice the sample size of the ones.
*  People now know you should take a B12 supplement.
*  The studied markers indicate a generally sufficient cobalamin status independently of the diet
*  preferences, lacto, over vegetarian or vegan.
*  Slide 57.
*  Now this is a study that looked at runners in May of 2019, really current.
*  And it feels like you might not have the most current data because you said to me in your
*  email that nutrition is only one part of what you do and you have lots of other things that
*  you're doing, right?
*  So slide 57, this is comparing vegans, vegetarians and omnivores.
*  And these are runners?
*  Yeah.
*  And recreational runners.
*  Recreational runners, yeah.
*  All three groups showed an adequate biomarker status of B12-related parameters.
*  And then slide 58, it would be.
*  And this one not only backs up my point about vegans and plant-based eaters, but also that
*  supplement users are better.
*  So the vitamin B12 status of supplement users of vegans and omnivores was higher compared
*  to the non-supplement users.
*  And a higher proportion of non-supplement users had B12 parameters outside the reference
*  range.
*  They were low.
*  So again, that's more evidence that people, it's a good idea to supplement in general
*  because you just have higher levels.
*  And after, and consensus recommendations, after you get over 50, you have lower intrinsic.
*  It's a water-soluble vitamin anyway, right?
*  Yeah, but after 50, you lose intrinsic factor so you can't absorb as much.
*  So directs you.
*  Right, but it's not dangerous to have higher levels.
*  So even if you-
*  No, no, no, you could, yeah, exactly.
*  It's a good thing to supplement, period.
*  Right.
*  And the blanket recommendations.
*  So every single thing that I said in the B12 statement is true and backed up by-
*  So, Jamie, bring up slide 59 for me.
*  If we're looking at totality of evidence, let's look at more evidence.
*  Totally.
*  But again, I'm not pointing those three studies out to say there's not more.
*  I'm saying that you handpicked a study where vegans were not-
*  No, I didn't handpick a study, James.
*  There's many studies here.
*  We talked about many studies.
*  No, you picked one where they were not taking vitamins.
*  And I agree.
*  So we agree that people on plant-based diets-
*  Should take vitamin.
*  Should take vitamin B12.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  And we agree that most people are getting their B12 supplement in any way just indirectly
*  through animals.
*  Fair enough?
*  Fair enough if you follow the diet that these animals were on where they were forced to
*  take their B12 supplement.
*  Which is the majority of people.
*  And again, I would say, look, if you want to eat 95% plants and you're going to-
*  Do we know how common it is for them to supplement animal diet with B12?
*  Is it a rare thing due to metabolic conditions?
*  With cattle, it's lower because there's a lot of-
*  Much lower.
*  It's not that rare.
*  But it's lower, but it's not super rare because a lot of soil is deficient in cobalt.
*  And cows need to consume the cobalt to manufacture the B12 in their rumen.
*  So it's more of a side effect of mineral and nutrient-deficient soils for cows.
*  For cows, for ruminants, but not for pigs and chickens and that sort of stuff.
*  Vegans have higher homocysteine levels than omnivores.
*  And the 9 out of 10 comparisons found higher homocysteine levels in vegetarians than omnivores
*  and higher levels in vegans than vegetarians.
*  Right.
*  The prevalence of hyperhomocysteineemia among vegetarians may actually be higher than that
*  among non-vegetarians already diagnosed with heart disease.
*  So that's 9 of 10 comparisons.
*  That's not hand-picking one study.
*  That's 9 out of 10 comparisons that have been done on this topic.
*  Right.
*  And like you said before, we shouldn't just look at the markers.
*  We should look at the outcomes.
*  Right?
*  And the outcome is that vegans and vegetarians with higher homocysteine levels do not have
*  increased risk of cardiovascular disease or diabetes or death from those or from cancer.
*  I didn't make the claim that they do from that study.
*  We're talking about B12 and homocysteine being a marker of B12 deficiency here.
*  And Chris, I am showing that you picked a study from 2016 which had a very small sample
*  size.
*  That's 9 out of 10 comparisons right there.
*  That was not the only study that I showed.
*  I'm not saying that you hand-picked that study.
*  I am saying that when you came to B12, all of the statements that I made in the film
*  were true and you said that they were patently false and you were wrong.
*  I didn't...
*  Joe, come on.
*  Listen, I've said it already.
*  I've come in here.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I've said it.
*  You're correct.
*  Right.
*  Because I've come in here and people are saying, oh, what are you going to say to that
*  debunk?
*  Chris did not debunk the film.
*  He made misrepresentations of our claims and he got things factually wrong.
*  Well, he certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that animals, particularly
*  cows, are not given B12 supplements.
*  He certainly seems to have gotten it factually wrong that at least some of the B12 that people
*  would be able to get in the past they got from water and soil.
*  And that 40% of people are division B12 and that the best way to get B12 is the supplement.
*  So he got everything...
*  I don't agree with the best way to...
*  Can I just finish?
*  Yes.
*  Can I just finish?
*  Yes.
*  I know, but you're wrong.
*  So, the thing is, I have proven that he got three or four things factually wrong.
*  About B12.
*  Right.
*  And I am a combatives instructor.
*  Okay?
*  I've heard that.
*  Right.
*  I've heard that a couple times.
*  But I'm just saying, I'm putting myself down.
*  I understand.
*  I'm not like a super intelligent guy.
*  Well, you are, Sue.
*  You are very intelligent.
*  I've said that before.
*  What you did is you did research on these very important subjects and you acquired a
*  lot of data.
*  So, I...
*  But this is what people do when they go to school.
*  The difference between someone who is educated and not educated is not whether or not they
*  go to a specific place.
*  No, totally.
*  It's whether or not they absorb the information and when they study.
*  And you said you studied a thousand hours before the film and three thousand cents.
*  You're obviously educated.
*  You understand what you're talking about.
*  So anyway, you got things factually wrong about B12.
*  So, to the people listening or watching, do you really want to put the interpretation
*  of the data in the hands of someone that just got so many things wrong about B12?
*  Well, he got things wrong about your assertions about B12.
*  Yeah, I made four or five claims.
*  The claims still stand that vegetarians and vegans have much higher rates of B12 depletion
*  or deficiency than omnivores.
*  The bulk of the studies show...
*  If they're supplementing, they do not.
*  Well, of course not.
*  If they're supplementing, they don't.
*  But if they don't supplement, they do.
*  Right, but everyone agrees.
*  But, like, there's no disagreement.
*  Vegans and vegetarians and anyone over 50 and most, like, the safest way...
*  And you're now disputing the safest way to get B12 is to take a supplement.
*  It's the best way to get B12.
*  It's the surest way to get B12, but it's not necessary for many people.
*  Right, for people that can afford to get blood tests, which is not most of the world.
*  Like, we're sitting in America in a nice, like, air-conditioned room, and, you know,
*  we've got cars and we drove here and we can afford to go to the doctor.
*  Like, the best way to get B12 is to take a supplement, period.
*  And you're wrong if you think otherwise.
*  If you can afford...
*  Yeah, sure, if you can afford blood tests every six months...
*  We're going to get B12 supplements to everybody around the world?
*  But hold on, that's expensive, right?
*  Here's the thing, if you have a diet that gives you the ample amount of B12...
*  Then you don't need a supplement, sure.
*  Then you don't need a supplement.
*  Sure.
*  What you're saying is that blood tests are expensive, so you should take an expensive
*  supplement?
*  No, they're not expensive.
*  B12?
*  No, it's like, if you buy it in bulk, it's like $2 a year.
*  But, no, I'm not saying that.
*  A year?
*  Yeah, yeah, if you buy it in bulk.
*  $2 a year?
*  Where the fuck you buy your vitamins?
*  For cyanocom...
*  If you buy it in bulk...
*  For a cyanocomalt...
*  And it lasts like...
*  Really?
*  Yeah, you've got it, but the trick is you've got to like, you'd have to split it with a
*  bunch of people because it's like years' worth of supply.
*  But anyway...
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So, no, the argument is that...
*  Fuck, I should just donate to the world.
*  If it's only $2 a year, I feel like I could hook a lot of people up.
*  I've also shown that in the study that you presented in your e-book stated that they
*  weren't absorbing it as well from animal products.
*  I'm not saying there's not B12 in animal products.
*  And also we have to remember one last thing.
*  The B12 that people are getting in animal products, it was supplemented in the first
*  place.
*  In some cases.
*  Not in grass fed.
*  In the vast majority of animal products that people are eating, B12 is supplemented.
*  And so I'm just saying the safest way to get B12 is to take a supplement.
*  In the vast majority?
*  Is that true?
*  Yeah, you think the vast majority of people are eating wild caught fish and...
*  I don't know how many animals are actually getting those supplements.
*  All of the chickens.
*  I have friends...
*  All of the chickens?
*  All of the chickens.
*  But that's...
*  Chickens are omnivores.
*  They're not fed omnivorous diets for the most part unless they're free range chickens.
*  Have you ever seen a chicken fuck up a mouse?
*  It's pretty stunning.
*  Yeah.
*  They're carnivorous little monsters.
*  Then chickens, when you get them and you get those eggs and the eggs are like a really
*  dull yellow, those are animals that are eating grain only.
*  Those are vegetarian chickens.
*  That's not what they want to eat.
*  What they want to eat is worms and bugs and rodents.
*  Yeah, they're not living in their natural state.
*  Right.
*  In their natural state, they probably don't need to have supplementation.
*  This is sort of an argument against vegetarian diets for chickens really.
*  Because chickens aren't really supposed to eat that way.
*  And feedlot for beef.
*  Feedlot for beef, exactly.
*  They're not supposed to eat grain either.
*  Can we get to protein?
*  Because I think if we miss protein, then we've like done a good job of discerning this.
*  No, we're not going to miss it.
*  We have plenty of time.
*  Cool.
*  I'll keep going.
*  So you made some excellent points and you definitely cleared up what was misrepresented
*  by what you said.
*  Right.
*  It's really why I really appreciate you having me on.
*  Because you guys did like a three hour debunk, right?
*  And there was just a lot of things that were factually wrong.
*  And there's more that I can point out.
*  Okay, let's get into the point.
*  I just really appreciate you having me on.
*  My pleasure.
*  I appreciate you being here.
*  And I really appreciate Chris.
*  As much as we disagree, I really appreciate you coming on and giving me the opportunity
*  and you being here.
*  Let's talk about protein.
*  I know I'm getting like emotional and something like this, but I'm annoyed that people are
*  like, yeah, I'm trying to take seven years.
*  Yeah, I get it.
*  Cool.
*  So you want to talk about protein and what the issues are?
*  There's still also just the red meat and dairy thing outstanding too.
*  Oh, whether or not red meat is bad for you.
*  Yeah, we never really cleared that up.
*  Well, why do you think the red meat is bad for you?
*  We can go with protein.
*  But let's finish that.
*  Okay, sure.
*  Because we really should finish that and we can always move into protein because I'm sure
*  protein is going to be a long discussion.
*  Well, I know the thing that's going to happen here.
*  So we can talk about red meat.
*  I've shown that like some of the individual things like heme ion, for example, are shown
*  to be pro-inflammatory.
*  And by the way, just to back you up, let me see where the slide is.
*  Is pro-inflammatory necessarily correlated with poor health?
*  Because sometimes things that provide inflammation aren't bad.
*  Yeah, your body has a positive reaction to it.
*  Yeah, it's a hormetic stressor.
*  So there are things like exercise, you exercise, you create hormesis, right?
*  Right, sure.
*  Sauna.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's the same thing where he'll sort of try and show that fish, you know, the TMAO,
*  for example, you'll say, well, how can TMAO be bad?
*  We'll get to that.
*  We'll get to that.
*  But let's stick with red meat.
*  Why do you think red meat is bad for you?
*  Well, TMAO is one of the things in red meat, just like heme ion that I just showed is inflammatory.
*  The heme ion is associated with cardiovascular risks and that heme ion is found in meat.
*  And eating plants in a healthy diet pattern.
*  It offsets it.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, it offsets it.
*  Is there evidence that eating meat by itself is associated with cardiovascular disease?
*  Nobody ever has eaten meat by itself.
*  What about these carnivore diet people?
*  Well, there's no research on the carnivore.
*  Those guys are the canaries in the coal mine, aren't they?
*  There's no research on that.
*  So that's one of my people just eating all meat diet.
*  Yeah, there's not.
*  Yeah.
*  We both agree.
*  Let's just create a false dichotomy, Chris.
*  If there was a kind of like all animal products diet, not just carnivore, but eggs and all
*  this stuff, and then there was a fully plant based diet, subliminal would be 12.
*  Which one would you advocate?
*  If false dichotomy?
*  I'd probably pick the plant diet.
*  Probably.
*  Although I would be concerned about nutrient deficiencies.
*  Yeah, I've never advocated for the carnivore diet.
*  I said as much in the last show.
*  That says something about plants, right?
*  Plants are awesome.
*  Right.
*  So we agree on that.
*  Yeah, he's never had anything wrong.
*  No, no.
*  What all he's ever said was that eliminating all animal products from your diet is probably
*  not healthy unless you follow a very strict routine where you make sure that you have
*  all your bases covered nutritionally.
*  That's what Chris has said from the jump.
*  I would extend that and just say that I don't think there's strong evidence suggesting
*  that including some animal products in your whole foods plant based diet is harmful.
*  That's where we seem to have an issue.
*  And I even said that the range of that can vary tremendously.
*  Could be 5% for someone who's just eating mostly plant based diet and they're eating
*  some shellfish and organ meats for the nutrient density.
*  Or you could have someone who eats more animal products.
*  It depends on the person and what their needs are.
*  I'd go with that first half and the second half.
*  But just to back up what Joe does, slide 62.
*  Because I mentioned this earlier but we didn't put a slide on but I think the graphic, again
*  I know most of you are listening so if maybe Joe you could describe it to people.
*  Differences in post-prandial inflammatory responses to a modern versus traditional meat
*  meal preliminary study.
*  So this is kangaroo meat versus beef.
*  Wagyu beef.
*  Is that how you pronounce it?
*  I think so.
*  Wagyu.
*  You'd recognize that markers in CRP, TNF alpha and IL-6 are inflammatory markers.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay, good.
*  So I just want to point out that yeah, if you're going to eat 90% plants and you're
*  going to eat the rest of it from animal products, I think that wild caught elk and kangaroo
*  meat, stuff like that, would be the way to go by far.
*  Well, it just makes sense.
*  Just to show you, look at the, there's about half the inflammation roughly coming from
*  the wild caught elk.
*  Well, that makes sense because most of the time we're dealing with, when you're dealing
*  with beef, you're dealing with this grain fed unhealthy animal.
*  When you're talking about wagyu beef, that's a dying animal.
*  I mean if you saw a person whose muscle tissue looked like a wagyu steak, you'd be like,
*  bro you got to get on a fucking diet.
*  You know?
*  I mean really.
*  Like an athlete, if you looked at an athlete's muscle tissue, it would look like a piece
*  of elk most likely.
*  It would look very lean and healthy and dense.
*  So anyway, I just want to point out that one, that shows a couple of things.
*  That shows that meat does create inflammation.
*  I would like to see this on grass fed meat as opposed to this feedlot bullshit.
*  But even if it matched the kangaroo meat, we're still seeing inflammation there.
*  And yeah, and certainly like he said, I agree.
*  If you're going to eat animal foods, I think it's wise, timing wise, to eat a lot of plant
*  foods with those animal foods.
*  Right?
*  Well, I definitely think that-
*  If you're going to eat animal foods, you should eat a lot of plants.
*  There's also a lot of benefits to it in terms of fiber, in terms of the bio-
*  Got microbiota.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot of benefits to having these fermented vegetables as well.
*  things like kimchi and having things that provide you with good probiotics.
*  All these things, there's great benefit to a lot of plant foods.
*  Yeah.
*  And people on plant-based diets just end up naturally getting more fiber.
*  For sure.
*  Most people are deficient in fiber, right?
*  And if you look at like the Paleolithic period, you'd be looking at like maybe a hundred grams
*  of fiber.
*  I agree.
*  Very high fiber intake.
*  And people on plant-based diets get more fiber than people on other diets.
*  As long as you're eating healthy, as we both agree.
*  Oh yeah, sorry.
*  So yeah.
*  Eating like pasta and pizza and bullshit.
*  But just to be fair though, even in vegans and vegetarians and all of the studies, they're
*  still getting more fiber despite the fact that you and I would agree they're not eating
*  the healthiest diet.
*  Overall, completely plant-based people are the only people that have, fall within the
*  recommended BMI range, the people that get the most fiber.
*  BMI range, body mass index?
*  Is that what you're talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, but body mass index-
*  That's a shitty one, right?
*  That makes it the obese.
*  Right.
*  Yeah?
*  There's a lot of nonsense to that.
*  I agree.
*  I agree generally that if you look at people who are on a vegetarian or vegan diet and
*  compared with people on the standard American diet, then they're going to have healthier
* -
*  Right, and people-
*  But that's also the standard American diet.
*  If you take someone who's eating healthy plates of broccoli and kale and also has a piece
*  of grass-fed meat, that's what I want to talk about.
*  I want to talk about people who are following their conscience.
*  No, I totally agree.
*  Of course, you're going to see markers.
*  For example, the longest study on a paleo diet that had a two-year follow-up, and they
*  had improved, they'd lost body fat, they had improved blood markers.
*  What was really interesting is they were told to eliminate dairy.
*  So you cut out dairy.
*  They were told to reduce their amount of or cut out completely processed plant foods like
*  white flour and sugar and all this type of stuff.
*  They were told to increase their fruits and vegetables, and they were told to increase
*  their meat consumption.
*  They got improved health markers all across the board.
*  Now what was interesting is at the end of the two years, what they found was that people
*  had not stuck with the meat recommendations.
*  So they kept their meat recommendations the same.
*  They got out processed junk food, trans fats and stuff that you'd all agree we should get
*  out of our diet.
*  They took out milk out of their diet, and they increased the amount of plant foods.
*  So it's very clear that the benefit did not come from increasing meat consumption.
*  It came from increased plant food consumption.
*  Or decreasing bullshit.
*  I think the benefit is decreasing bullshit.
*  Right.
*  It's a two-fold thing, right?
*  You cut out things that are inflammatory, and you put in things that are anti-inflammatory.
*  You cut out things that are low in antioxidants.
*  You incorporate things that are high in antioxidants.
*  So that was the major benefit.
*  It wasn't from increased meat consumption.
*  Who's saying it is from increased meat consumption?
*  Not me.
*  No, I'm just saying that was the benefit of a paleo diet is going in a more whole food
*  plant-based direction.
*  Right.
*  But I think that's what everyone says.
*  The idea is that you eliminate processed foods.
*  You eliminate sugar.
*  I agree.
*  You eliminate these things that are just filled with...
*  But we know that it's not just...
*  It's a two-fold difference when you incorporate whole plant foods.
*  There's the opportunity cost.
*  So you're getting rid of crab.
*  In my personal opinion, and based on the consensus, you're replacing both highly processed foods
*  and animal foods, and you're incorporating more whole plant foods.
*  And that is the scientific consensus is to eat a predominantly plant-based diet.
*  You could say the same thing about the benefits you see with vegetarian and vegan studies
*  comparing with standard American diet.
*  I agree.
*  You're removing a lot of the crap.
*  I agree.
*  But what studies have you got comparing a NutriVore diet to a whole food plant-based
*  diet?
*  We don't have them.
*  So we have to infer.
*  And when we infer, we have to rely on experts that are experts in their field.
*  We don't turn to Chris and go, okay, can you tell us more about nutrition and anthropology
*  and urology than all of these experts?
*  I think that's...
*  I agree.
*  You shouldn't just listen to me.
*  But I don't think it's genuine to suggest that there's a consensus that a whole food
*  plant-based diet is a better choice than a plant-based diet that also contains some
*  animal products.
*  I agree.
*  It would be hard to prove the difference.
*  We have no studies on that, and we probably won't, unfortunately, in the near future because...
*  Right, especially for long-term outcomes, right?
*  Because you can't put people on for 40 years.
*  So I agree that it's hard.
*  Again, I've said before that we should be getting the vast majority of our calories
*  from whole plant foods.
*  I think there's enough in the literature to show...
*  And the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recognizes that completely vegan diets are
*  helpful for all life stages, including for athletes.
*  I think that there's sufficient evidence to go 100 percent, but I'm not telling people
*  that they should be doing that.
*  I'm saying people can eat whatever they want.
*  But I think we both agree that people should be getting out junk food, right?
*  Soda and trans fats.
*  Oh, by the way, on trans fats...
*  So that's why I asked you in the beginning of the show what your position was, because
*  that's the fundamental question for me, is this question that we're talking about right
*  now, which is, is there sufficient evidence to suggest that, you know, everybody, most
*  people, whatever you want to say, should be on 100 percent or even 95 percent plant-based
*  diet versus a plant-based diet that contains some animal products?
*  And my argument all along has been, no, there's not sufficient evidence to claim that.
*  You also think that a completely plant-based diet is likely to be nutrient deficient and
*  all these other things.
*  Do you know his history?
*  Do you know how he started out as a vegan?
*  Yeah, and that's why I think there's emotional ties.
*  My history is not relevant.
*  You know, that's an N equals one in terms of what happened to me.
*  But you presented yourself.
*  You said that I had like, the worst mood and like, the suppression.
*  Yeah, but I've also said, people acknowledge that there are many successful vegans and
*  vegan athletes, like, Ritro, for example.
*  You've invoked the N of one, and also you didn't follow the scientific consensus about
*  plant-based diets when you did it.
*  So you chose a macrobiotic diet and you chose a raw vegan diet.
*  Those were just two iterations of what I did.
*  Right, but why did you choose those when they weren't based on scientific consensus?
*  Because I wasn't, this was 20 years ago, and I wasn't paying attention to it at the level
*  that I'm at now.
*  And you traveled around the world and you got sick and you attributed it to the diet,
*  which it may or may not have been.
*  No, I didn't attribute it to the diet.
*  That's what you-
*  I don't even know why we're talking.
*  My experience is-
*  Because it's relevant because it shows that, like, I don't know why you were vegan or vegetarian.
*  Maybe it was for like, animal rights reasons.
*  Maybe you felt bad for going back to eating meat, so now you need to field the proof.
*  The reason that you need to try to debunk the film is because you've got a massive business
*  selling supplements and protein powders and giving diet advice.
*  So our film doesn't make you-
*  I make very, very little money selling supplements, James.
*  It's not a massive business.
*  It's basically convenience for my patients.
*  I'm just saying overall-
*  My business is basically training people and being a clinician.
*  I don't profit from selling animal products.
*  You're doing it directly because you advise this diet.
*  So the film was very bad for you personally.
*  Because if people believed the film, which, you know, like the Defense Health Agency,
*  they review the film.
*  They don't care about, like, this myth that we should eat in exactly the same way as our ancestors,
*  not that we even really ate that way.
*  But they don't care about that myth.
*  They care that what is going to be better for warfighter effectiveness
*  and to cut the healthcare costs of our military.
*  So they looked at the science independently.
*  You think they're like the Defense Health Agency is full of vegans?
*  I mean, so you have-
*  The film is neither here nor there for me.
*  But that's what we're here for.
*  You said that the film-
*  The reason that I'm here is because, and the reason that I came when Joe invited me,
*  and he can probably tell you that it took a few invitations to get me here.
*  It is just to provide the other side of the view here.
*  It's not because it materially affects me in any way.
*  Believe me, I've got lots of other things, as I told you in the email that I'm focusing on.
*  Yes, you do lots of other things, not on nutrition.
*  So even like my nutrition team, they spend full time either consulting elite athletes
*  or military personnel, or they're digging into the research.
*  Like our chief science advisor, eight hours a day, all he does is dig into the latest research.
*  And so you come onto Joe's podcast, and you're supposed to, like,
*  people are supposed to believe that you are the best person to,
*  because you say it's about the metric analysis, and you say it's about the totality of evidence.
*  We agree.
*  But you're suggesting is that people should listen to your interpretation of the evidence
*  when you get things factually wrong.
*  People should make up their own minds based on the evidence that we have provided.
*  And you don't even know how to read a basic forest plot.
*  In all of the shows.
*  That is my point, because you're not certified and you're not,
*  I, okay, I'm, again, I'm not a specialist in nutrition.
*  Like I would have liked to have brought David, our chief science advisor,
*  who knows a hundred times more about nutrition than I do.
*  And you're coming on here telling people what to eat.
*  You said yourself you're not an expert in nutrition,
*  and you don't know how to read the nutritional data.
*  Let's talk about some of the claims.
*  Okay, let's talk about protein.
*  Let's talk about protein.
*  No, we're talking about the film.
*  Let's talk about the protein.
*  So is that fair, Joe, we should get to it?
*  Right.
*  Okay, so can I just, just so I understand your position,
*  and I'm sorry for getting worked up.
*  Like I feel like I'm like an attorney trying to interrogate you, but I feel like
*  I spent a lot of time digging into research.
*  I had the research checked and checked and checked again.
*  I had the research checked to make sure that it was not cherry picking,
*  that it was reflective of the preponderance of evidence.
*  But who was checking it?
*  Were they people who were not advocates of a whole food plant-based diet exclusively?
*  Or were they people like, because all of the experts in the film are people who are clearly
*  aligned with this, that perspective.
*  I interviewed them because they're aligned with the consensus.
*  And no, and over half of the people in the film.
*  I thought you just agreed that there is not a consensus that a 100% plant-based diet is better
*  than a diet that includes a lot of plants and some animal products.
*  Yeah, correct.
*  So where were the experts that would represent that point of view?
*  That it doesn't have to be 100% plant-based diet.
*  I agree. It doesn't have to be 100%.
*  The film said plant-based diets.
*  Now I'll tell you why we only interviewed vegans over the athletes, right?
*  The ones that actually spoke on screen, Arnold is not vegan.
*  He doesn't drink dairy, thinks it's for babies, and he's cut down meat by 80%.
*  But all the people, I mean, Nate is not 100% vegan.
*  He's on a largely plant-based diet, eats a bit of seafood and a bit of stuff like that.
*  Beets, eggs.
*  Yeah, eggs as well.
*  The reason that we only put, and by the way, we did interview Lauren Cordain and Rob Wolf,
*  and I can get to that as well if you want.
*  Because the anthropologists laughed in their faces when they heard the claims that they made.
*  I'm talking about scientists who are on the team that publish the papers that I've shared.
*  Yeah, like Nutrerex who are funded by the industry.
*  And we can get to that.
*  No, not Nutrerex.
*  That's disingenuous to claim that all of the research that I've shared here is industry-funded
*  and so we can't acknowledge it.
*  But your claim that the recent study that just came out, and we're getting off track,
*  but the recent study that just came out that said that red meat and processed meat is totally fine.
*  Like, you really want to go with that?
*  Like, to me, it feels like you don't have your finger on the pulse, honestly.
*  I'm not trying to be rude.
*  I think you probably know a lot about your field.
*  Well, what do you think about that study?
*  Well, the Nutrerex study?
*  The study that said that red meat...
*  Yeah, that's the Nutrerex study.
*  Okay.
*  So in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the day before the film came out,
*  six studies exonerating red meat and processed meat, all from the same company that are apparently
*  giving recommendations.
*  Well, guess what?
*  Exponent and Nutrerex and companies like that are not the ones that give public recommendations
*  on what people should be eating, number one.
*  Okay?
*  And we talked about this in the film with Exponent.
*  Nutrerex is like another exponent.
*  So if you look at their recommendations, first of all, Frank Hu, who is now the chair of nutrition
*  at Harvard, he took Walt Willett's place, said the panel's blanket recommendations that adults
*  should continue to...
*  Their red meat consumption habits is highly irresponsible.
*  Walter Willett said it's the most egregious abuse of data he's ever seen.
*  And if you want to follow their recommendations, if you could put up slide 92.
*  So they did the same thing in 2017 for the sugar industry.
*  So there was a meta-analysis in the...
*  When you say they, you mean the exact same company?
*  So Bradley Johnston is the director and co-founder of Nutrerex and the first author
*  of the paper that we're talking about for red meat.
*  Okay?
*  That just exonerated red meat apparently and processed meat.
*  So this is the same company says that at present there seems to be no reliable evidence indicating
*  that any of the recommended, derelict, caloric thresholds for sugar intake are strongly
*  associated with negative health effects.
*  So they did a meta-analysis saying that don't worry about your intake of sugar at all.
*  That was what their meta-analysis conclusion came to.
*  And then two years later, the day before the film came out, and do you really think
*  that's a coincidence?
*  Do you think that the...
*  So let me tell you something, okay?
*  Of our email subscribers, do you know the email address of the person that opens and
*  views our emails the most?
*  It's from the beef checkoff program.
*  And they've been doing that since we started.
*  So they sign up for our mailing list.
*  They look at when the film is coming out.
*  And you think it's a coincidence that the day before the film comes out, they release
*  a paper exonerating red meat and cancer.
*  And the same thing...
*  So if you're going to buy into the Nutri-Rex study about red meat and cancer, then to be
*  fair, you've also got to buy into their conclusions about sugar.
*  Because they were paid.
*  I'll tell you who they were paid by.
*  Okay?
*  So financial support for that paper was funded by the technical...
*  Now listen to this.
*  Sounds great.
*  The Technical Committee on Dietary Carbohydrates of ILSI North America.
*  And ISI is the International Life Sciences Institute.
*  Sounds pretty legit, right?
*  So its members include Coca-Cola, Hershey Company, Pepsi Company, and Red Bull, and
*  a bunch of others.
*  Folks looking out for your best interests.
*  There you go.
*  Okay.
*  It would be a problem if that was the only...
*  So do you...
*  No, you just...
*  You claimed, oh, this recent study...
*  And I honestly...
*  Again, no disrespect.
*  You're busy with lots of other things.
*  You run a successful business consulting people, selling stuff.
*  I get it.
*  You don't have the time.
*  You weren't able to read a basic forest plot to look at statistical significance and
*  confident intervals.
*  Okay?
*  I just don't think that you're the one to interpret the data.
*  So the reason you don't have...
*  You haven't seen the hundreds of really respected scientists that have come out saying this
*  Nutri-REx study...
*  And by the way, there's an investigation into the annals of internal medicine because of
*  this for accepting this stuff from Nutri-REx.
*  But if you're going to accept the meta-analysis on red meat and on processed meat for cancer,
*  then you've also got to accept the 2017 study meta-analysis.
*  If you accept the source.
*  If you accept the source...
*  They're both the same...
*  It's the same Nutri-REx.
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so...
*  If that was the only meta-analysis that showed no association between red meat and
*  heart disease or cancer, that would be highly problematic.
*  No, I'm talking about the one...
*  First, I'm talking about the one that you cited.
*  You made out that this is like...
*  Okay.
*  Second of all, I have pointed out that industry-funded research is four to eight times more likely,
*  right?
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  To do.
*  And going back to that dairy one, by the way,
*  do you know that when they did their meta-analysis, they doubled and tripled and quadrupled up
*  because when they looked...
*  The meta-analysis that analyzed the meta-analyses, the multiple meta-analyses, included
*  the studies multiple times.
*  You see what I'm saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Because they took it into account each time.
*  And so when the industry floods the scientific research with their funded studies, again,
*  if they fund a study, it doesn't turn out...
*  They're studying other studies and come up with the same conclusion,
*  adding those on as if it's an additional study.
*  Is that what you're saying?
*  So, look, if the industry funds studies and only...
*  If you're in a beef industry or a dairy industry, are you going to put out studies that aren't in
*  your favor?
*  No.
*  Right?
*  And they don't have to.
*  You spin it.
*  And so what you do is if you want to make saturated fat look okay, or if you want to make cholesterol
*  okay, you can switch things around the study to make it look good.
*  If you want to look at eggs, and for example...
*  And I don't want to get like...
*  It can turn into a three-hour debate about cholesterol and saturated fat.
*  But if you go from 10 eggs a week to 12 eggs a week, it doesn't raise your serum cholesterol.
*  So that's how they did the study.
*  But if you go from no eggs a week to one egg a week, it does increase you, because there's
*  something called the cholesterol plateau.
*  So what the industry does is it tricks you.
*  But then when you look at eggs and outcomes like cardiovascular disease, you don't see...
*  Well, you do.
*  But we're getting off track.
*  I was just making a point that industry-funded studies sway the results of the meta-analyses.
*  Right.
*  And I think that's fair.
*  And it's done with the sugar industry, and it's done with...
*  It was done with tobacco.
*  And again, I'm not comparing the amount of increased risk of cancer from tobacco.
*  That was never a claim that was made.
*  It was the playbook that is used by the drug industry, by the meat industry, by the sugar
*  industry, by the dairy industry.
*  So even though your film came out, and these studies came out right before your film,
*  it's kind of proving your point that this same company that tried to exonerate the
*  sugar industry is also...
*  Yeah, if you're going to accept that, if you're going to cite that as evidence,
*  if you're going to cite that company...
*  The reason I think, because like you said, you're so busy on many other things,
*  is I just don't think that your fingers on the pulse...
*  That was not the only study that I cited.
*  I know it's not.
*  I know it's not.
*  There's many other meta-analyses, 2010, 2015, we can look at them, you know...
*  Well, let's do that.
*  Okay.
*  But can I just point out, though, the one...
*  Let's look at those studies.
*  But again, they're funded, you know, they're including studies that are funded by industry.
*  And so unless you can pass those out and say, is that really...
*  We can't rely on any study that has...
*  No, I didn't say that.
*  That's the straw man.
*  I said that you would really need to look at the way in which a study is designed to see if it
*  was viable. And you also have to replicate the studies. You know, like studies have to be
*  replicated. And so what I'm saying is...
*  Can I just finish the last point now?
*  Go ahead.
*  I'll let you show as many studies as you want. Because again, you can show as many studies as
*  you want. You can't prove that you're not handpicking them to suit your bias.
*  You are the one that quoted this study. It shows that your finger is not on the pulse,
*  because hundreds of like top scientists have written letters or joined in the same letter
*  to the Annals of Internal Medicine asking for those studies to be retracted.
*  And there's now an investigation into the Annals of Internal Medicine,
*  yet you are citing that study.
*  An investigation doesn't prove... Nothing has been proven yet.
*  It doesn't prove anything, but it shows me.
*  I was aware of that controversy.
*  And you can't even read forest plots.
*  It's not...
*  You're telling people what to eat.
*  The controversy is not surprising if red meat has been demonized for as long as it has been,
*  and then a study comes out which exonerates it, it would be entirely expected that there
*  would be controversy.
*  So and do you know who that study was funded by? Can you just pick up slide 93?
*  Just to show that...
*  Anyway, so it's not just me saying this. I mean, the
*  the scientists who discredited the meat guidelines didn't report past food industry ties.
*  So that's because remember most people are listening.
*  Scientists who discredited meat guidelines didn't report past food industry ties.
*  The lead researcher Bradley C. Johnston said he was not required to report his past relationship
*  with a powerful industry trade group.
*  I don't know what that trade group is, but if you scroll down...
*  Well, I can't...
*  Does it say?
*  What does it say, Jim?
*  Oh, it's a slide.
*  Oh, sorry.
*  I can tell you, in the first one, the sugar one, it was that Pepsi and all this stuff.
*  Although they make a non-profit with a fancy sounding name,
*  and then they back it all with industry funding.
*  Same with the meat study. That's why I don't understand why he'd use it.
*  If you were being objective, like you're saying, oh, there's other studies,
*  but why name this one as though it's got validity?
*  Because...
*  So you feel like they concocted this study and released it right before your film specifically
*  to try to take some more window sales?
*  I think it's likely that it was tied into the film, but it doesn't matter whether it is.
*  To present that study as evidence when the consensus of the scientific researchers is
*  against that study, that is calling for an investigation that has asked for it to be
*  retracted, the co-author of the paper, who's part of the leadership team at Nutri-Rex,
*  he's the advanced chancellor of Dean in Agriculture and Life Sciences at Texas A&M,
*  Texas A&M is partnered with the Beef Checkoff Program,
*  right, and is part of Networks.
*  And this is also discussed in the New York Times, slide 94.
*  And there's actually... It goes a lot deeper than that. It actually goes back to
*  Brazilian government, but...
*  Let's see slide 94.
*  Slide 94 is just talking about...
*  Research group that discounted risks of red meat has ties to program partly backed by beef industry.
*  So anyway...
*  So this doesn't necessarily mean what they're saying is incorrect,
*  and this is where it gets slippery, right?
*  Because if they found things that happen to be correct, and they release it,
*  but they release it from a shitty company that has said things in the past...
*  It's a shitty company that chose...
*  It handpicked which studies included metanalysis.
*  Because you've had plenty of time to explain this.
*  To get to your point, Chris, you agree with the founding...
*  With the conclusion of that study, and you think that the evidence points that there's
*  many studies that point to the idea that red meat is not in fact the culprit.
*  And the culprit is when you're looking at these epidemiology studies,
*  that you're looking at the overall diet of these people and asking them,
*  do they eat meat? You're not asking them what is the quality of the food they eat.
*  Yeah. So I agree that conflicts of interests are a problem.
*  And the editorial that was published in Annals alongside of this study said,
*  um, this is sure to be controversial, but it's based on the most comprehensive
*  review of the evidence to date. Because that review is inclusive,
*  those who seek to dispute it will be hard pressed to find appropriate evidence.
*  And who wrote that?
*  The meta-analysis had studies covering millions of participants over 34 years.
*  There are several other meta-analyses that have been done over the past few years.
*  So I don't know the best way to show these because I've got them in a Google doc.
*  So 2017, let's see if I can give you the title, Jamie, maybe you can Google it or something.
*  Contemporary review of the relationship between red meat consumption and cardiovascular risk.
*  Quote from that study, the review concluded, quote, recent findings demonstrated that
*  despite the presence of heme iron and carnitine, red meat does not significantly increase
*  cardiovascular risk when it is assumed in recommended doses. You have 2014 meta-analysis
*  of 13 studies. Again, these are this one, Jamie is
*  called association between total processed red and white meat consumption, all cause
*  cardiovascular disease, heart disease mortality.
*  And this is a good example of what you were just saying, Joe. There was a slight increased
*  association between red meat consumption and cardiovascular mortality. And then at the end,
*  no significant associations observed between any type of meat and heart disease mortality
*  results of the present meta-analysis indicate that processed meat consumption could increase
*  mortality. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity observed
*  in most of the analyses, as well as the possibility of residual confounding, meaning healthy user
*  bias. Lippi in a meta-analysis of 11 studies of red meat consumption and heart disease concluded
*  the quote, the current literature data does not support the existence of a clear relationship
*  between a large intake of red meat and increased risk of myocardial ischemia.
*  And then this is one of the largest that was done. Let me give you the title of this, Jamie.
*  Red and processed meat consumption and risk of incident coronary heart disease. That should
*  bring it up. That's by Misha et al. Conclusion, consumption of processed meat, but not red meat,
*  is associated with higher incidence of heart disease and diabetes. So there's a bunch
*  of meta-analyses that have been done over the years that reached the same conclusion. And we
*  could look at the same, this is for heart disease, but there are also some for cancer.
*  So it's not just that study. There are many others as well. There are many other meta-analyses.
*  And there are meta-analyses on the other side. So you can present studies here so that the people
*  listening- That's true. There are meta-analyses on the other side.
*  Right. And you can present the data for the people listening, and it appears like the
*  preponderance evidence is that. But your guidelines for diet, they're not in alignment for saturated
*  fat. They're not in diet for cholesterol. They're not in diet for the amount of carbohydrates for
*  normal people. They're not in line with the consensus for carbohydrates for athletes.
*  I've said a range of carbohydrates could be appropriate for people.
*  What I'm saying is you are not in alignment with the scientific consensus. And you claim that we
*  cherry picked in the film, right? But you handpicked studies to back up your bias. Not to mention
*  that we've pointed out that the studies in those meta-analyses, some of them are heavily funded
*  by industry, not saying that you should throw all those out. But you don't have the wherewithal
*  to assess the studies in the meta-analysis because you point out yourself that you can't
*  even read a forest plot. So he reads conclusions, right? He reads conclusions in writing, but has
*  not looked at the actual data. So you haven't been able to establish. When I was like, spent
*  the first thousand hours, I would look at the whole paper and then I would look at each author
*  and I would dig into each author to see where their funding was from. And I'm telling you that
*  the industry is funding studies to sway things in their favor. And you point, it shows that you
*  don't have your finger on the post. There's no doubt about that.
*  Why didn't you point to those last time you were, why did you point to an industry-funded study
*  and not to those before?
*  But in the last one, why point out in the Nutri-Rex study,
*  you know, when it was clearly invalid, the scientists-
*  Wait, wait, wait, not clearly invalid.
*  It wasn't representative of the scientific evidence. They handpicked the studies that
*  were included. They used a grade methodology. Do you know what a grade methodology is?
*  I do.
*  Okay.
*  And it was-
*  And do you think that's appropriate for assessing food rather than pharmaceuticals?
*  According to some nutrition organizations, it is.
*  Including, well, very few. It's not a scientific consensus.
*  So what is the National Academy of-
*  Do you want-
*  To see here?
*  It just basically, they used the methodology that wasn't appropriate for looking at
*  what they were looking at. It's just the same with the Siri Torino and the Chowdery studies.
*  What they were looking for could never have been found, the association between saturated fat
*  and cholesterol levels. It could never have been found based on the methodology that they used.
*  But again, we still haven't got to-
*  Do you agree with that?
*  We still haven't got to protein.
*  And I-
*  But we'll get to that.
*  Yeah.
*  Let's go-
*  But wait a minute.
*  So it's absolutely true. I've never claimed that there aren't studies correlating red meat with-
*  Right. So you show the ones that you're a favorite.
*  I never have claimed that. And I've said those studies are highly problematic for all of the
*  reasons that I've talked about on the last show and on previous shows. Healthy user bias,
*  problems with data collection, food frequency questionnaires, relative versus absolute risk,
*  confounding, not looking at physical activity, and the biggest confounder of all,
*  not looking at diet quality. So even though there are-
*  I love to go to diet quality because I know you like to use Matt Lalonde's work,
*  which has never been published, which obviously was built in-
*  What? I have not used Matt Lalonde's work in connection with diet quality.
*  I'm talking about food patterns, like healthy food pattern, eating healthy-
*  In terms of nutrient density, though, in terms of nutrient density,
*  which is a part of diet quality, you have referred to Matt Lalonde's work.
*  I'm happy to talk about that. I'm talking about still the problems with-
*  Let's make a note of-
*  I'm still talking about the research on red meat being problematic because it doesn't
*  consider the overall diet pattern.
*  Right. But again, your views, first of all, you don't have the wherewithal
*  to interpret the scientific evidence, which is very clear that you don't understand forest plots.
*  You recognize that you have to look at the totality of evidence, and you have to be able
*  to dig in and look at where the things are pointing. You yourself said, I am not an expert
*  in nutrition, and you said- Again, I'm not either, which is I don't even know why we're sitting here
*  having this discussion, honestly. We should get some real experts in.
*  Well, we could do that too.
*  And you can point on your side who you think the experts are, and I'll point on our side who
*  we think the experts are. I don't even like to say size really because to me, it's not really
*  my position. I think your position is a lot better than the standard American diet.
*  The opposition is really like the carnivores, right?
*  Well, your position, yeah, that's the opposite. Your position though is in defense of your film.
*  Yeah, I'm defending the film, and I think-
*  And in response to his critique.
*  And how do you think I'm doing so far?
*  Well, with B12, it was a home run for sure.
*  Well, I think there's lots of other things, but-
*  Well, the thing about, we still haven't really shown whether or not there's evidence that,
*  see, that's the problem with all this stuff. When you're dealing with these epidemiology studies,
*  it's so hard to figure out what's what.
*  I agree.
*  What are these people eating? Who are these people? Are they drinking? Are they doing drugs?
*  Like, what is the overall health quality based on?
*  I agree. And that's why we're looking at-
*  And how much of it is based on their diet.
*  And that's why we look at scientific consensus. Could you just bring up slide one?
*  Could you agree with him or dispute what he's saying about scientific consensus?
*  Would you agree that you're not in line with the scientific consensus?
*  My general dietary recommendations?
*  Yeah.
*  Probably some aspects of it, but not all aspects.
*  But generally, I mean, come on.
*  I don't think that's-
*  What do you think the scientific consensus, Chris, what do you think the scientific consensus
*  is when it comes to dietary recommendations?
*  Well, it's changed a little bit in the past few years. It definitely was low fat,
*  although that is changing a little bit.
*  I agree.
*  There's some recognition of different fats, different, you know, may have different effects,
*  et cetera.
*  Right. But let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Let him-
*  Would be limiting red meat, would be limiting saturated fat, limiting cholesterol, eating a lot of
*  plants and whole foods, limiting sugar and refining-
*  This is a scientific insight.
*  Yeah.
*  Legumes and-
*  Hold on, please. What is that based on? What do you think that's based on?
*  That's based on, you know, mostly observational research and then some mechanistic studies
*  and some RCTs, but even RCTs, if you're comparing, again, like some of the studies
*  that are cited, for example, in David Goldman's papers, they're comparing a standard American
*  diet with a plant-based diet. So in a crossover trial, randomized trial,
*  that's not comparing apples to apples. But anyways, to get back to your question,
*  I would say about half of what I recommend is consistent if we use the factors that I just said,
*  eating whole foods and not eating processed and refined foods, limiting sugar, all of that.
*  The areas where I differ are red meat, saturated fat, but not always. I think that's individual
*  and depends on how people actually respond to saturated fats and eggs and total fat-
*  Or what about legumes and grains?
*  I think they can be part of a healthy diet if they're well tolerated.
*  And you do think that like the research has shown a whole food plant-based diet versus
*  standard American diet, people are getting improvements on that?
*  Yeah.
*  I think everybody-
*  I definitely think there should be more studies.
*  Standard American diet.
*  Yeah. I mean, some people I've found don't do well with grains and legumes,
*  especially people with digestive issues. So, you know, for them, maybe not, but I've never argued
*  that grains and legumes are, you know, like I'm not a paleo, strict paleo kind of advocate.
*  And you pointed out last time, I think it was Rhonda Patrick that talked about it too,
*  so obviously I watch your podcast. And, you know, you pointed out about these hormetic
*  stressors that we talked about earlier. And so, you know, there's people that are talking about
*  anti-nutrients in food. They're written on what they're talking about.
*  That's a red herring.
*  Right.
*  Because they don't know what they're talking about. And yeah, it's a really common thing.
*  And they're basically- look, the landscape of food is enormous. The landscape of dietary
*  requirements and of health, it's enormous. And, you know, just you talking about spending
*  thousands and thousands of hours combing over this research can attest to that.
*  Yeah.
*  And Chris, I think you can as well. I mean, this is a very complicated issue. And there's a certain
*  amount of bio-variability. Different people have different physical requirements, different
*  nutritional requirements. But I think we're trying to zoom in on what is actually bad for you
*  and what is actually good for you. I think we agree on. I think we all agree. Everyone here
*  agrees that you basically need a certain amount of vegetables in your diet. You need vitamins,
*  whether you can get those vitamins from supplements like B12 supplements, or whether you can get it
*  from the actual food that you eat. There's certain dietary requirements that I think we're all in
*  agreement on. I think where we disagree on is whether or not red meat is bad for you
*  and what kind of red meat we're talking about and why, you know, why is it bad? And what,
*  is it bad when it sits alone or is it bad when you're eating it with vegetables,
*  which is what we're recommending in the first place? So if we're recommending that you eat it
*  with vegetables and these vegetables do have the sort of balancing effect of the negative
*  aspects or the perceived negative aspects, even though there's no evidence that those negative
*  aspects when eaten by itself, because we don't really have long-term studies on carnivore diet
*  people. So I think mostly we're in agreement here. You're defending your film, and rightly so.
*  I mean, I think there was a bunch of claims that were untrue.
*  Well, clearly you've proven with the B12 issue that he said some things that made you look like
*  you were saying things that were inaccurate and uninformed.
*  And he's done that with a bunch of other things too, though.
*  Okay.
*  And so he did it with protein.
*  Well, let's go to the protein next.
*  Before we get to that, can I just show what the consensus actually is on diet?
*  Yes.
*  Okay, so can you just bring up slide one? And I mentioned this earlier, but I didn't show it.
*  So the World Health Organization recommends that people eat a nutritious diet based on a variety
*  of foods originating mainly from plants rather than animals, which you said you could agree with,
*  because it's not vegan, mainly from plants.
*  Yeah, I mean, the proportions are a question mark there, depending on...
*  And then actually slide three would be the FAO, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
*  Nations.
*  Appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan diets.
*  This is fine. This is the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
*  Okay. Appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan diets, are healthful,
*  nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of
*  certain diseases. That's a weird... Appropriately planned is a weird way of phrasing it.
*  Well, it is. And it's also a little bit unfair because it sort of says,
*  if you eat an omnivorous diet, it doesn't need to be appropriately planned. Eat whatever the hell
*  you want.
*  Right. Yeah, that's a good point. These diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle,
*  including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older adulthood,
*  and for athletes. So these women that you hear that are getting arrested because they're
*  babies or malnourished because they're following a vegan diet, appropriately planned is the key
*  phrase.
*  Yeah, I would agree with that. I said that at the beginning of the show. I acknowledge that they're
*  very healthy, high-performing vegans, people on plant-based diets, if they do it right.
*  And if someone were to take your advice, would they have to do that right and plan that?
*  Or would it just be like...
*  Yes. I think everybody agrees that you have to plan out your diet correctly.
*  If you want to exercise properly, you've got to have a plan. If you want to eat properly,
*  you've got to have a plan. You've got to plan to go to the grocery store. You've got to plan
*  to get the right foods.
*  There are some nutrients that are of potentially bigger concern, I think, on vegan vegetarian diets.
*  Happy to get into that. Can we just show two more slides on the proponents of evidence?
*  Sure.
*  Slide three.
*  I completely agree with appropriately planned.
*  So we recognize that as long as you plan it well, you have B12, you get a wide variety of foods.
*  This is the same one.
*  No, no, the slide after that.
*  I meant for omnivores too.
*  Here we go.
*  We want people to be thinking about what they're eating.
*  Totally. And we agree that most people are eating a bunch of crap.
*  So here we go. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the American Heart Association,
*  and the 2015 and 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend
*  appropriately planned vegetarian diets for improved health.
*  That's a statement by Frank Hu, who is the current Chair of Nutrition at Harvard,
*  looking at plant-based diets and cardiovascular health.
*  And then slide two is the FAO. Sorry, I got the slides in the wrong order.
*  It's the FAO. I don't know what messed up with the…
*  It doesn't look like that on my page.
*  Anyway, households should select predominantly plant-based diets,
*  rich in a variety of vegetables and fruits, pulses and legumes,
*  which again a lot of people on the paleo diet would say is useless,
*  and minimally processed starchy staple foods.
*  The evidence that such diets will prevent or delay a significant proportion of non-communicable
*  chronic diseases is consistent.
*  So all I'm pointing out here is that you're not in line with the consensus of science
*  and that you don't have the ability to read the papers. That's all I'm pointing out.
*  I'm in line with pretty much everything that has been shown just then.
*  There's only one of the paragraphs that you mentioned, even mentioned animal products,
*  and it didn't recommend excluding them entirely.
*  So you would point out that one, you agree that predominantly plant-based is the way to go.
*  And that as long as you plan it appropriately, vegan diets can be helpful.
*  Yes, I agree. I said as much that vegan diets can be helpful on the first show if they're
*  appropriately planned. And I don't know, predominantly plant-based, again, if we look
*  at the plate and we see mostly plants there and then animal products, then yes.
*  But that's a bit disingenuous.
*  If we're talking about by calories, I don't…
*  Do you agree by calories then?
*  Uh, no.
*  Okay, so you're not in line with the scientific consensus again, though?
*  I'm not in alignment with that consensus.
*  So it's not on the predominantly getting your calories from plants, which is the
*  scientific consensus. You're not with saturated fat and cholesterol and a bunch of other things,
*  heme iron. But anyway, so can we go to protein? Because we're really here to defend his critiques
*  of the film. Because honestly, I've got people that watch the film, change their diet,
*  started feeling better, watched this podcast where he debunked the film and then called me,
*  write me a message on Instagram saying you are full of shit.
*  You shouldn't read comments.
*  Actually, it was an Instagram message.
*  Don't read that either.
*  But anyway, I'm just saying it's a shame that you have someone that doesn't really have
*  the capability to really understand the literature coming on here and people buying into it.
*  Talking smack on the film where he made a bunch of factually wrong comments.
*  Let's talk about protein.
*  Let's get into protein for sure.
*  And again, I'm not even the one that's qualified. If I'm beating him on some arguments,
*  what do you think you would get if you had a real nutrition expert in here?
*  I'm not qualified to do this.
*  I'd like to see it.
*  I would like to see it. Okay. So can I just, your concerns with the protein,
*  and just make sure I'm understanding your argument. Protein quantity and protein quality.
*  And within protein quality, it would be the amino acid profile and the digestibility.
*  Those are your issues with the protein.
*  Those are the considerations of protein that I think are important.
*  We're on the same page for what we're discussing.
*  So I just don't know where you...
*  And again, not saying that it's not possible to get enough protein quantity and quality
*  and mix of amino acids if you're really on it.
*  Right. But it was well planned. Just like if any other diet was well planned.
*  I think it's less likely that you'll get protein right on a completely vegan diet without...
*  Yeah, I agree.
*  ...than it is on a diet that contains animal protein.
*  It's more complicated.
*  It's not more complicated. What it is, is if you don't know what you're doing,
*  and you've been eating a certain way for 30 years, and you suddenly take meat off the plate,
*  and you only eat what was left on the plate, you're going to have a problem.
*  Yeah, it's more complicated.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  So that's why we put resources on our website.
*  The level of knowledge and understanding about that is pretty low in my experience.
*  Right. No, I agree. And that's why we put...
*  So, yeah.
*  I agree. I think people need more resources to make better informed decisions about their health,
*  about their exercise, and so on. I agree.
*  What's your position on what he said about protein?
*  Okay. So I'm just quoting you from last time.
*  Man, you really put me through a lot of hours of extra work.
*  Now it's gone from like 3,000 to like 3,100.
*  You know? Anyway, so there's just so much wrong with what you said that I just had to go into
*  every single topic. But anyway, so three ounces of... You said three ounces of 90% lean ground beef.
*  Do you think that animal fat is not good for you? Because all of a sudden now, Chris, is a...
*  Well, that's not what he's saying. He's talking about protein content.
*  No, no. What was the statement in the film?
*  The statement in the film.
*  Lean ground beef, meaning that for protein content.
*  No, no, no. The statement in the film was...
*  I think that's the most common...
*  No, it's not actually.
*  If you go to the store and get...
*  It's not actually not.
*  It's 80... Anywhere from... Grass-fed beef, which is what I advocate.
*  Okay. Great.
*  That's generally leaner.
*  Okay, great.
*  But he wasn't specifically talking about protein content.
*  No, I know. That's what we're going to go into.
*  Right. Okay.
*  So listen to...
*  Lean ground beef.
*  Okay. So basically what I had said, and I can't remember the exact words that I said, but
*  I pretty much do, because I recorded it a number of times.
*  So, one cup of cooked lentils or a peanut butter sandwich has about as much protein
*  as three ounces of beef or three large eggs. That was what I said.
*  Okay.
*  I might be off on a word, but that was what I said.
*  Okay.
*  I said about as much protein. Okay?
*  So you go on to say three ounces of 90% lean ground beef. Well, already what you did is you
*  picked leaner beef. But even though you don't advocate for that, you don't think the animal
*  fat is bad. So what you did is you picked the leanest beef. Anyway, you say it has 24 grams
*  of protein. I'm not sure what your source is. But he does advocate for grass-fed beef. Grass-fed
*  beef is leaner. So if he's talking about what he does advocate for, that does make sense.
*  It's three ounces of ground lean meat.
*  Okay. But the thing is the point in the film...
*  You weren't saying that.
*  Most people... Yeah, exactly.
*  So you were saying...
*  I'm defending what we said in the film.
*  Right. So you were saying regular, standard American ground beef.
*  It has about as much like this about... What we're trying to point... The point of this thing was
*  not to say this is the best foods to eat. It was just to say like...
*  You're making a comparison.
*  The regular stuff that you eat, like a peanut butter sandwich, people think no protein at all.
*  Right.
*  They think... People think that plants have no protein. The first question you get asked,
*  well, where do you get your protein? So I said it's got about as much protein. So you say then...
*  By the way, I'd listened to your 30-minute podcast trying to take down the film, which came out before
*  you came on Joe's podcast. And you said that you... And you sort of backed this up. I don't know...
*  This happened from one article and it got spread and spread and spread. But someone said,
*  you need five tablespoons of peanut butter to get the same amount of protein.
*  In what world does someone... And you changed your tune a little bit when you came on the podcast.
*  But when I make a peanut butter sandwich, I use bread, two pieces of bread. How many...
*  You would use two pieces of bread and peanut butter sandwich?
*  I think that's what a sandwich means.
*  I think by definition, right? It's pretty much...
*  Sure.
*  So what you did on your podcast, you admit that a tablespoon of peanut butter is four grams,
*  right? Okay. And what is four times five?
*  Twenty.
*  Right. And then per USDA, how much is one piece of whole wheat bread?
*  Four or five, depending on the source you look at.
*  How many pieces of bread? Two.
*  So five grams of protein in bread. The one that I actually have at home is six grams,
*  but let's take USDA. So five plus five is? Chris?
*  Ten.
*  Ten.
*  Plus twenty from the peanut butter is?
*  Thirty.
*  Well, even on the leanest beef that you chose, it was twenty-four grams. Why did you say you
*  needed five tablespoons of peanut butter? And I know how it came about. Because I think what you
*  do is you take other people's work like Denise Mingher and all these other people, you read their
*  articles and you take their arguments because some of the stuff that you have on your site
*  is very reflective of people's other arguments on other sites. So there was something that started
*  where people started saying you need five tablespoons of peanut butter. And in the first article,
*  it said without the bread. Now, I don't know why you don't include bread when you make a sandwich
*  because most people do. It's not just peanut butter. And I almost bought a peanut butter sandwich in
*  here today to show you what two tablespoons of peanut butter looks like or two and a half.
*  Because the one I had, I looked at it and it was surprising like when you actually measure a real
*  tablespoon, it's actually not that much peanut butter. And so mine I figured out has about like
*  two and a half tablespoons and two pieces of bread. My bread has like six grams. So my peanut butter
*  has about twenty-two grams of protein. Anyway. White bread would be more like two or three grams.
*  But again, we showed a piece of whole wheat bread on there. We're advocating eating mostly
*  whole foods. That's a whole grain. No one is saying, we even said in the film, if we wanted
*  cherry pick, we just try and push plants. We said white sugar and white flour. Bad for you.
*  Associated with weight gain. Carbohydrates from whole food sources are associated with
*  better lean body mass, lower body fat percentage and everything else. But anyway. So I don't
*  understand your math. What I think you did is you took that article because articles that spread
*  from that article forgot to put the bit in parentheses about without the two pieces of bread.
*  So you take five tablespoons of peanut butter at four grams a piece. That's twenty grams,
*  right? Which is around what? Two pieces of bread, ten grams. So why did twenty-four grams of your
*  hand-picked lean beef, which you don't even necessarily like, there's no reason that you
*  should be picking that one. That's not what we showed in the film. Why are you comparing
*  twenty-four grams to thirty grams? Why didn't you say four tablespoons of peanut butter?
*  Fair enough? Got it wrong again. So this is what, it's frustrating when I watch the show
*  because like every five minutes I'm hearing something that's just factually incorrect.
*  Oh, that's why you're here.
*  That's why I'm here. Now again, appreciate the both of you. So
*  can we just look at actually the breakdown of all these different things?
*  So again, the peanut butter sandwich I had is 22 grams, but that's maybe a little bit more
*  than something like that.
*  The other argument was the quality of the protein.
*  We'll get to that, but quantity first. So if you go to bread on slide five,
*  well, I don't need to do this. You've agreed. You've agreed. Right. Okay. So and lentils,
*  if you want to do slide eight. Oh, no, no, sorry. What you haven't agreed on is I'm going to say
*  two tablespoons of peanut butter and two pieces of bread. Okay. Fair enough?
*  Say for what?
*  I'm just going to say like the comparison roughly.
*  I mean, you can put a bit more.
*  For the protein content.
*  Yeah, I'm just going to show. Okay. So
*  Three tablespoons.
*  So can you just...
*  Three and a half tablespoons of peanut butter and two pieces of bread.
*  No, no, no. No, I'm going to show you how I'm going to show you.
*  I'm going to back up what I said in the film. So let's just go through the slides quickly.
*  If that's okay. So slide five and apologies to all the listeners who don't get to see all my slides.
*  Don't tell them to go to YouTube.
*  Yeah.
*  Here we go.
*  So this is USDA. So I don't know where your number's from, but I went to the USDA site.
*  Unfortunately, it changed in October. So it's not quite the same as when we were making the film.
*  But anyway, one slice of bread, five grams of protein, and you accepted that, right?
*  Okay, good. Peanut butter, two tablespoons, eight grams, you accepted that.
*  You accept that two tablespoons of peanut butter has eight grams.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. We could have more. I have like more, but whatever.
*  Okay. There we go.
*  So you agree that 18 grams of protein for the peanut butter.
*  That's the sandwich we showed in the film, whole wheat bread, peanut butter.
*  Okay. So the next slide. And again, I'm being very conservative on this, like in the amounts.
*  So now we look at lentils, one cup, 17.9 grams of protein. That is USDA again. Would you accept that?
*  Yeah, I haven't looked at this, but yeah.
*  I know that on the large, on the left side, one cup.
*  I accept USDA as this absolutely source.
*  Okay, good. But you accept USDA when it comes to this, but not in terms of the recommendations.
*  We're talking about, yeah, we're talking about quantity of micro-
*  Okay, cool. So we're on the same page.
*  This is something that's been clearly measured. This is not something like recommendations.
*  No, okay, sure. So, but we're on the same page. We're taking this as a source.
*  Okay.
*  Okay. So now if we go to slide nine. Oh, sorry. The one that you just had.
*  The one with the eggs, Jamie.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  There we go.
*  So three eggs, 18 grams of protein. Would you say so far we've got about as much protein
*  in the peanut butter sandwich with two tablespoons, not the five that you claim.
*  It's less. I mean, 18 is not 24.
*  No, no, no. I'm getting to the beef. I'm saying so far what I have presented,
*  just the two tablespoons of peanut butter, and it came to 18. I was really conservative, right?
*  I could have put more peanut butter. I could have had bread that had more, like the one,
*  I don't want to name the brand, but you'd admit that you can get bread that's got six grams of
*  protein. Okay. So I'm being really conservative just to sort of prove a point. But so far we've
*  had a peanut butter sandwich with only two tablespoons of peanut butter. And seriously,
*  try that at home, Joe. Like actually measure it with a measuring.
*  Yeah. Well, I talked about it in the podcast. I would probably have about five.
*  Okay. So anyway, I probably would too.
*  Three large eggs.
*  Three large eggs. Okay. So now we go to organic.
*  Organic ground beef. Standard organic ground beef.
*  Three ounces.
*  So three ounces is 17.5 grams. If you want to get into it, we can get into like,
*  because that's per 100 grams. So I can, if you want.
*  What's the fat percentage?
*  9.2 grams.
*  So it's half fat?
*  Half fat?
*  No, no, sorry. It's 9.2 grams per 100 grams. See, we had to do the calculation.
*  Oh.
*  But that. Okay.
*  But this is the regular organic ground beef.
*  If you go to this.
*  In the neighborhood of.
*  And then what to be fair, because I knew you'd bring up a grass fed beef,
*  so that I found the lowest and the highest.
*  Okay.
*  Okay. So go to grass fed beef, slide 11. Three ounces. This is on the very low end.
*  So this would probably be the fattiest meat, but you wouldn't be against animal fat, right?
*  Not typically.
*  Okay.
*  Depends on the person and their situation.
*  But we're just talking about protein here anyway. So lowest 14.4.
*  On the highest end. I actually think my number. 18 grams.
*  Okay. So peanut butter sandwich, 18 grams. Lentils, 17.9. Can we round it up?
*  Yeah.
*  Three eggs, 18 grams. Okay.
*  Three ounces of beef, 18 grams at best.
*  Right. When I looked up grass fed beef.
*  So it's essentially saying exactly what you said.
*  I'm not saying if you go 90% lean, you can have more protein. No doubt.
*  So you can find protein that's got higher. I said about, I was trying to show,
*  that dispel the myth that you, you know, plants have no protein and animal foods have all this
*  protein. So I've just shown you there. Now your second point was that the problem with,
*  his second point was the problem with the peanut butter sandwich to get 18 grams of protein.
*  I think this is a fair point. You would have to eat 410 calories. Right?
*  So if you go to slide 15.
*  It was actually the more important point because I'm not necessarily,
*  you know, that may not be a problem for somebody who's training.
*  No, no, no. But I just want to talk about protein.
*  No, I know. But can we just go quantity? Can we finish quantity?
*  Can we finish quantity first? So can you bring up slide 15? So you'd admit that you can get
*  like a decent amount of protein. Your argument was you can get like percentage. So slide 15,
*  the lentils for 18 grams of protein. Again, if you want to check this calculation,
*  stop at any time. I'm fine. I have had this triple checked. Okay. 18 grams of protein,
*  231 calories. Okay. Because you like point, I love that people like to point out the beef
*  and then the peanut butter sandwich and try and compare those. Even though we were right on the
*  protein, now you're trying to pick on the calories. So you didn't pick the lentils,
*  which have 231 calories. The next one, slide 16 has.
*  Which is about the same for beef. Which is about 210 calories. Grass-fed beef
*  in the first instance. Grass-fed beef in the first instance, slide 17, 275 calories. And
*  that was on the one that wasn't so lean. And 70% lean beef. And I'm just pointing out there's
*  different ranges. 417 calories for 18 grams of protein. Right? So fatty meat, which you don't
*  think fat, like the animal fat is bad, right? No. Okay. So 70%. So he's talking about the
*  protein percentage. There was less in my peanut, like there was more protein percentage-wise
*  in my peanut butter sandwich than there was in the green beef. And then the last, no, not the
*  last one. Yeah. We could have picked something with less calories. So if we picked Tempeh,
*  for example, slide 19, 170 calories. So again, would you say-
*  But I think his argument was, the argument was the quality of the protein.
*  No, no, no, no, no. There was two arguments.
*  Yeah, the part of it was you would have to consume more calories.
*  Okay. But just before, can I just prove it at one point? Yeah. So the first part was you can't,
*  there's nowhere near as much protein. And then there was like, oh, it's based on the calories.
*  So the percentage of protein isn't good. You would have to have more calories to get
*  the same amount of protein. Which is not true. You don't have to. You don't have to. Okay. So
*  we made a mistake again. That was not a central part of my argument.
*  No, but it was a part of it though. It was a part of it though.
*  Quantity and quality. Yeah, it was quantity and quality.
*  And the quantity was broken down into two things. You just can't get as much for like,
*  you know, you can't get as much in that serving. They're totally wrong. You'd have to have five
*  tablespoons of peanut butter. Totally wrong. Agree?
*  Agree that you don't have to have five tablespoons.
*  Right. Thank you. Okay. And then you also said that you'd have to have so many calories that
*  you couldn't get it and you were wrong again. Agree?
*  For the peanut butter sandwich or just in general?
*  Just in general from plant foods. Yeah, I agree that you don't need to have 600 calories of
*  lentils to get that much protein. So can we get slide 20 sweet potato and
*  leek omelette from Chris's site where the protein is coming? So this is from your site, 18 grams
*  of protein, 410 calories. The funny thing is I typed in recipes and I think it was either
*  first or second came up. All I did was pick the first two high protein recipes from your site
*  because I didn't pick the soup or the salad because I thought that'd be unfair. So I picked the first
*  couple. So sweet potato and leek omelette, the protein coming from eggs, 18 grams of protein,
*  410 calories. Do you have an issue with your own meal? No.
*  So do you have an issue with the peanut butter sandwich having 410 calories?
*  No. Okay. Second one.
*  Second one. Like I said, that wasn't central to my point.
*  There was a secondary part. It was a secondary argument.
*  It's hard to get the same quantity. Which is not. Which is not. Would you just
*  admit that it's not? And quality. The DS score.
*  We'll get to the DS score in a minute and I will show that you were wrong again.
*  So taro and bacon hash, slide 21. 18 grams of protein, 570 calories. If you want to go
*  to your breakfast of champions, which I thought, you know, for athletes, slide 22.
*  And by the way, I took your data. I didn't take USDA. I assumed that you were not lying.
*  So I took the totals from the bottom. But I standardized it for 18 grams of protein
*  because we're just comparing everything percentage-wise. 688 calories. Do you think
*  that people should not eat that meal? It depends on who you're talking about,
*  but no. It's low protein. It's low protein, right?
*  I don't think that people shouldn't eat it. Is it low protein?
*  It can't rely on that for you. It can't rely on that for your protein.
*  Right. So first of all, it's low protein by like most people's standards, but your standards of
*  protein are much higher. So that would be far off. So that would mean to make up for the rest of the
*  day, you would have to have meals that were like almost just protein, or maybe they'd have to buy
*  the protein powder from your website in order to make that up. Anyway, so let's move on to now the,
*  by the way, slide 23, largest study ever done comparing completely plant-based eaters with
*  studies showing plant eaters versus meat eaters.
*  75 grams a day?
*  That was the average.
*  Aren't you supposed to have one gram per body weight, per pound of body weight?
*  No.
*  You're not?
*  That's the upper end for athletes.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah. It's 0.8 grams. This is how much they were actually getting in the largest study ever done
*  comparing plant-based eaters. So you can see it's about the same. And actually, per pound of lean
*  body mass, fat-free mass, the vegans were getting slightly more because they had better body mass
*  index. They were slightly leaner. But anyway, just want to say it's roughly similar. So your
*  next argument was that athletes need more protein. It's like, right? But no, it wasn't an argument
*  because you admitted that I pointed it out in the show. So if you go to slide 24,
*  I just want to point about the amount that we're actually requiring.
*  Okay. We're going into the amount now.
*  We're still, we're in an amount for athletes because his point is like,
*  maybe you can get enough to survive, but not to be an athlete. So I'm going to look at-
*  I don't think that was his point. I think his point was that there's a different requirement
*  for athletes.
*  Yeah. There's a different requirement.
*  Then just to survive.
*  We weren't arguing on this point. Your point is you need more. His recommendations though,
*  what he does is he pushes them to a really high end that isn't consensus, showing that
*  they're trying to make it out that it'd be harder to get, which we've already shown you can get
*  enough protein for, you know, of course an athlete eats more calories, therefore they get more protein
*  as a percentage. So I just wanted to show two positions on this and then we can see if you,
*  again, you don't agree with the consensus of science. So this is the joint position paper
*  of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the Dieticians of Canada, and the American
*  College of Sports Medicine. So this is for athletes, okay? This is just one. I'm going
*  to show you another in a second. Do you want to read it out, Joe? Because it might get
*  in the board of my voice.
*  Current data suggests that dietary protein intake necessary to support metabolic adaptation,
*  repair, remodeling, and for protein turnover generally ranges from 1.2 to 2.0 grams or
*  kilograms per day.
*  Okay. And then the next slide, Jamie, if you could bring up slide 25.
*  I agree with that and have it in my...
*  Yeah, okay. I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
*  Okay. Protein supplementation beyond a total daily protein intake of 1.2 grams kilograms a day.
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
*  Is it the wrong one?
*  Why are you reading that?
*  From the big square? Protein supplementation...
*  You said 1.2.
*  No, I said 1.6, didn't I?
*  Okay. No, you said 1.2 to 2 grams. You read the thing from the last thing.
*  How did I do that? Did I really do that?
*  That's pretty genius.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  Okay. So this is what was in front of me, right?
*  Can you read it again? Yeah.
*  Oh, okay. I thought I read 1.6. I didn't.
*  That's what you heard? You're 1.6?
*  Oh, maybe. I thought you said 1.2 to 2.
*  Oh, well, no worries.
*  Anyway, no worries. Protein supplementation beyond a total daily protein intake of 1.6...
*  The squiggle means about.
*  Oh, okay. About 1.6 grams kilograms a day during RET.
*  That's resistance exercise training.
*  Training provided no further benefit on gains in muscle mass or strength.
*  And these are like really highly... And if you look at the...
*  I'm not listening to 1.6.
*  So a gram per kilogram, a kilogram is two pounds of body weight.
*  2.2.
*  2.2. So we're 1.6 grams. So it's less than one gram per...
*  It's 0.727272 grams per pound, if you want to...
*  So you're looking at about three quarters of a gram per pound recommended.
*  Anything over that provided no gains in muscle mass or strength.
*  I want to clarify. So you can see the two-phase breakpoint analysis on the top right, this chart.
*  Yes.
*  Okay. So you can see that. You can see as the chart goes up and then it flattens out,
*  there was no further gains in fat-free mass, which is the y-axis after 1.6.
*  However, there's something called a confidence interval.
*  How confident are they that these findings are correct?
*  And it was a very wide confidence interval. So it actually took it...
*  There was six grams either side. So it was actually up to 2.2 and down as low as one.
*  So it's 1 to 2.2. The other one, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the Academy
*  of Sportsmen is 1.2 to 2. So the widest range is 1 to 2.2.
*  So you think that this recommendation that's a standard thing that you hear in a gym,
*  one gram per pound of body... It's probably just...
*  No, that's legit. That's legit at the upper end. So 2.2 grams on the upper end, the 2.2 grams per
*  kilogram of body weight per day is one gram per pound of body weight.
*  So no doubt, and this is what you're talking about certain athletes like bodybuilders,
*  strength athletes, the confidence interval means to apply to everybody.
*  Some people could actually build... And this is about optimally building muscle as fast as possible.
*  And some people could do it at one gram, some people might 2.2, but regularly it looked like
*  1.6, 1.8. The scientific consensus is that. And you said that you agree with these ranges
*  of the scientific consensus. Yeah. And there's some evidence
*  suggesting that higher amounts may be beneficial. So if you go to... Or Jamie,
*  if you search for examine.com, how much protein do you need? There's an article there. And
*  examine.com is a... Do you know about them? I know of it.
*  So they're a panel of scientists or a group of scientists who do research.
*  A group of scientists, right. Not the American College of Sports Medicine or...
*  So the indicator... It's Canadian, right?
*  Indicator amino acid oxidation method, which is newer. If you scroll down, Jamie, to the
*  optimal daily protein intake for athletes and similarly active adults, or if you just click on
*  that, you see in that paragraph, IAO studies in athletes found different numbers because four of
*  the 49 studies in the meta-analysis that had that range, lower range, were conducted in people
*  with resistance training experience. The other 45 were newbies. IAO studies found different
*  numbers. Female athletes required 1.4 to 1.7. Male endurance 2.1 to 2.7. Amateur male bodybuilders...
*  But this seems the same. It says the average amount of protein required to...
*  He's probably going to get some higher ones. Maximize lean mass is about 1.6 grams per kilogram.
*  It's the same exact measurement. We don't even need to argue it. It's like totally accepted
*  in the sports world, like whatever. It also says some people need upwards of 2.2 grams per kilogram
*  for those interested in comprehensive breakdown. It provides another link.
*  I don't think we're far off. We're not far off on this.
*  It says regular training male endurance athletes require 2.1 to 2.7 grams per kilogram. So that's
*  the high range. Yeah. You did say something about 2.3 to 3.3. Remember in one study you pointed out?
*  That doesn't actually help you build more muscle mass, but if you're trying to lean out...
*  Also, I think some of the studies that you've looked at... There's one at 2.3. I've actually
*  got it on my computer. I don't have it in my slides, but there's one at 2.1 to 3.3.
*  There's two things about that. One, it's when you're in a caloric deficit because of
*  gluconeogenesis, you pull some of the protein and you use some of the energy. So there's less
*  protein, less for building. So if you're a bodybuilder cutting for competition, trying to get down to
*  like four or five percent, then your protein requirements go up above that's the normal range
*  because you're basically... You're using some of it.
*  You're in caloric deficit. You're using some of it for fuel.
*  And that's also the case with those carnivore people and a lot of keto people as well, right?
*  Yeah. And they probably adapt some because like in normal people, during exercise, you can only get
*  10% of your energy from the oxidation of protein into glucose. But so where are we going? So the
*  2.3 to 3.1, by the way, it's one in caloric deficit and it's two based on fat-free mass
*  qualifications. It's not based on total body weight, which is what all the recommendations are on.
*  So the 2.3 to 3.1 in some of these studies, if you did like, okay, if someone's 15% body fat,
*  it would bring it down. It wouldn't be 2.3 to 3.1 based on total body weight.
*  It's 3.1 based on the lean value. Fat-free body mass. So if you're 200 pounds
*  and you've got 20% body fat, you only weigh 160 pounds for this calculation.
*  Got it.
*  Anyway, where we are. So you like to talk about the IAO in terms of these recommendations. And
*  if you look at slide 102, Jamie, how am I doing by the way, defending the film?
*  Excellent. You're really doing really well.
*  Good. Not bad for a dumb old UFC fighter, right?
*  You're not that old.
*  41. Going great. Look what I did to the top of my head this morning.
*  What happened?
*  I just started the last couple of months. I started shaving it with it.
*  How much protein can the body use in a single meal for muscle building implications for daily
*  protein distribution? Shut upper of C1 of 2.2 grams per kilograms a day and cohort of young
*  male bodybuilders. Although the method of assessment indicator, a Mito acid oxidation
*  technique used in this study has not received universal acceptance for determining optimal
*  protein requirements. So it's in that same range.
*  So I'm not trying to point out that your IAO is off. I'm saying if you want to take your IAO,
*  the indicator amino acid oxidation index, if you want to use that, then the upper confidence
*  still is still 2.2. So the scientific consensus, I just want to make it very clear that you threw
*  out a bunch of these numbers on high protein, making out that vegans couldn't hit that level.
*  First of all, I've shown that foods can get that. I've shown that vegans can get sufficient
*  protein. And I've shown the levels that the scientific consensus on the protein ranges
*  for athletes are not in scientific consensus with these 3.3. But even if they were, there's
*  no reason you couldn't get it on a plant-based diet. I didn't argue that everyone should be
*  eating 3.3 grams. No, but you did argue, you made out that vegans couldn't get enough protein and
*  you were wrong. I didn't say they couldn't get enough. I said that it's less likely that they
*  will get enough. But it's not though. If they eat some of those recipes on your website,
*  they'll be getting less. So you're being disingenuous, Chris.
*  Chris Larkin Well, the first recipe was, that was sweet potatoes, right?
*  Was it? What was it?
*  Chris Larkin No, it had eggs in it. It was a-
*  Chris Larkin The second one.
*  Chris Larkin No, it was a sweet potato and leek omelette. It was a taro and bacon hash,
*  and then it was breakfast of champions with milk yogurt and eggs. So all I'm saying is,
*  people that watched the last episode where he was bashing the film, people walked away thinking,
*  you can't get enough protein. And then they thought the quality is not good enough. And
*  now we can get into that. Let's get into that.
*  Chris Larkin Let's get into that. Because this is the crux of it, right?
*  Chris Larkin Yes.
*  Chris Larkin It's like, you can get all these nutrients-
*  Chris Larkin Plus the amino acid content of a protein.
*  Chris Larkin First of all, B12 is an argument. Smash that. Protein is the next argument. I've
*  just smashed the protein quantity argument and now we'll get into the quality.
*  Chris Larkin We certainly smashed the protein quantity versus caloric intake.
*  Chris Larkin Right. And so it's fair to say, is it fair to say that based on what I've presented,
*  you can get about as much protein from the things that I said.
*  Chris Larkin Well, based on what you presented,
*  you haven't lost an argument yet. There's not one thing that you've said that's incorrect.
*  Chris Larkin And I even agree. If you're going to eat some meat,
*  should be some elk that you went and hunted yourself.
*  Chris Larkin So let's get into the amino acid content.
*  Chris Larkin Oh yeah. Love this. I was like, really,
*  researching for this, I really enjoyed it. Because there were so many flaws that I was just like,
*  I love, I was a truth seeker. So I went for the search for the truth in combat. Bruce Lee would
*  say, research your own experience, absorb what is useful, reject what is useless, add what is
*  specifically your own. I don't care about all the George Dillman BS about you can knock people out.
*  I don't care about that. I don't care about all these traditional styles of martial arts. I care
*  about what is the truth. Before I did this, I thought, oh yeah, paleo diet makes sense.
*  I actually switched to grass-fed beef because of the omega-6, omega-3 ratios. I started eating
*  chicken. But then I read the research and I wasn't biased by like anything other than finding out the
*  truth between the optimal diet for health and athletic performance and recovery in my injuries.
*  And that is the truth and that is what I have done. And now we're going to expose
*  how you were incorrect about the protein quality. So you said, what's a little disingenuous about
*  the film, they said every plant has every amino acid. Well, yeah, nobody disagrees with that.
*  But it does have enough of each of them. Well, first of all, people do disagree with that.
*  Like if you want to search, does plants have missing amino acids, people think that it's
*  missing some of the non-acid amino acids. So that's why we put that in the film.
*  And I said, you left off part of my quote. I said, every plant has every amino acid. That's
*  what you said. But you left off the end of my quote, which said every plant has every amino
*  acid in varying proportions. That is what I said. And you left out the invariant proportions,
*  which again, I think is disingenuous. He did not complete my quote. You handpicked part of my quote
*  to represent your view. So people, number one, do think that plants are completely,
*  a lot of people think just like, you know, that people are, there's articles saying,
*  well, no one thinks that protein gives them energy. I've got five studies here. The only
*  five studies that I could find on the knowledge of collegiate athletes. And around 50% in each
*  of the studies think that protein is what gives you energy. So people were saying, like, why did
*  you put that in the film? That's a straw man. People don't think that protein gives the energy.
*  About 50% of collegiate athletes think that protein gives you energy. That's why I addressed it in the
*  film. Anyway, back to you like the DIAAS, right? The Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score.
*  Or the PDCAAS, which preceded it.
*  Yeah, either of those. Right? So can you just mention why you like it and,
*  you know, what the benefits are and how it's determined? How is it determined?
*  So the benefit, the DIAAS takes into consideration amino acid profile and bioavailability.
*  Okay. And how is it, how is it, how is it studied?
*  The PDCAAS does, did not take into consideration.
*  Right. It looks at crude protein. It looks at the total amount of protein absorption,
*  not the individual amino acids, because different amino, different,
*  different individual amino acids absorbed differently. So that was one of the benefits
*  of the DS scoring. We'll call it DS and PD-CAS or whatever. So, but how is it determined?
*  Chris, do you know how it's determined?
*  The DS? I don't know the details.
*  So I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's like, it's almost like comedy. That someone is talking about these
*  systems that does not know how. Okay. So slide 27. And I'll tell you one of the benefits of the
*  DIAAS. So, and I think you might have mentioned this. So I think you might know more than you're
*  letting on. So one of the benefits is the auro-illial digestibility. So the PDCAAS,
*  right, that took the whole digestive tract to what came out of the end.
*  What are we looking at here?
*  So look at this. So this is how the DIAAS is brought about. So basically past the ilium,
*  you can't digest, your body doesn't absorb the protein really. It's digested by the bacteria.
*  Right. So this is one of the benefits of the DIAAS versus the PDCAAS, right. The old system
*  is that they saw how much protein went through the whole digestive tract, but that wasn't reasonable,
*  right. Because past the ilium, you're not digesting the protein, the bacteria are
*  digesting it and you're not getting it. Does that make sense? Yes. So basically they put a
*  pore in the pig. Now PDCAAS was mostly in rats and this is done in rats and there's some in humans,
*  but it's mostly done in pigs because it's a more similar digestibility to humans.
*  And they're basically assessing how much of that protein was absorbed, right. And how much of the
*  amino acids were absorbed. Now, some people make the argument, even the FAO point out the flaws,
*  some people make the argument, well, pigs have a different digestibility rate, which is true,
*  and they have a different amino acid profile requirement. Different. So some people would say,
*  therefore, DIAAS is a bunch of crap, right. I'm not going to make that argument. Even though it's
*  testing in animals, primarily not in humans, they've got a different amino acid requirement
*  and different digestibility capability. Okay. So I mean, would you think that that score is the
*  best one to use for humans? It doesn't make sense. Right. But I'm not going to even make that argument.
*  I'm going to go with you and say, okay, DIAAS is the best thing out there. Okay. Okay. So even
*  though you can question it. So you've said, this is a quote from last time when you were trying to
*  bash the film. It's all about protein quality. And this, as you said, is an established science,
*  a firmly established science. He was talking to you, obviously, and you must have said it was
*  established. They look at this, especially in like third world countries where protein deficiency is
*  common. So they try to figure out how to address this. Okay. Now, the FAO, the Food and Agricultural
*  Organization of the United Nations, what is their purpose? Chris. To prevent nutrient deficiency.
*  Thank you. So hunger, I've got a slide if you want to prove, but it's basically defeating hunger,
*  providing food security, not for America or for England, but for like the nation, you know,
*  like 130, more than 130 countries, right, where people are starving, malnutrition. That is their
*  purpose. So you've got to look at it through the lens of that. So if you can just put up slide 29,
*  because I just want to really back these claims up. I know the slides are getting kind of boring.
*  And again, apologize for people just listening. But I was just focusing on protein malnutrition
*  was largely conducted after the identification of say that- Quasior core. Quasior core.
*  Quasior core. And the realization that many children globally are suffering from
*  subclinical protein malnutrition, to address protein malnutrition, the composition and
*  digestibility of proteins must be determined. Okay. So we go to the next slide. And this is,
*  by the way, that was looking at the DS score. You know, you can see at the top. Can the DS score
*  decrease protein malnutrition? Then they go on to say, Joe, do you want to do it? The Food and
*  Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has developed methods to evaluate the protein
*  quality of food items. And in 2011, the digestible indispensable amino acid score,
*  DIAAS, was recommended as a successor to their previous method.
*  Okay. So we're not in a disagreement right now. I'm even going to forego, like, I'm not going to
*  argue about the animal having different amino acid climates, or even though that's like,
*  that's pretty funny, right? Like, why are you assessing? Anyway, so I'm not going to have that
*  argument. What I'm going to have is I'm going to go with everything so far, FAO, they're endorsing
*  over the PDS, a lot of experts endorsing over the DIAAS, over the PDCAS. So now in slide 31,
*  it's made for starving children. Okay? This is what it's made for. So I would agree, if you're
*  in a caloric deficit and you're in a country where there's very little protein, and you're
*  only getting 30 grams of protein a day, let's just say that the animal, like, take the animal stuff
*  out of it and like the way that the method is flawed, which the FAO points out. Let's just say
*  it's legit. I would agree. I would say, eat, get your protein from meat. I would agree,
*  because that's what it was designed for. As you can see, in looking at post exercise skeletal
*  muscle, the DIAAS does not attempt to consider how scores translate into optimizing more
*  downstream physiological targets of interest to a physically active person or athlete. So it wasn't
*  designed for that system. It was designed for starving people in countries where they were not
*  getting enough protein, and they weren't getting enough protein, as you would call high quality.
*  Okay? So would you recognize that it wasn't developed for that system?
*  Yes. Based on the scientific literature. But you're inferring it now for the amount that-
*  I still think it's a relevant measure of protein quality because it looks at amino acid profile and
*  ilial digestibility.
*  Yeah, it is. It is in starving countries when people are starving. I agree. But as you can see,
*  it's not just-
*  It's still looking at amino acid profile, right? You can see that. It's looking at the
*  relative content of amino acids in a particular food.
*  Yes.
*  And it's looking at the ilial digestibility.
*  Which I think is an improvement. I think it's got elements, even though the FAO has pointed out
*  its flaws, and 10 years from now, we'll have a better system. Right? But do you agree, probably
*  10 years from now, we'll probably have a better system?
*  I would imagine.
*  Okay. But it's the best that it can go off. But again, it looks at- and it's not just my opinion
*  that it's not used for that. This is like in sports medicine, 2019. And I agree, you're busy
*  with other stuff. You probably haven't seen this article that came out in February. Right? Have
*  you seen this article before?
*  I have not seen this particular article.
*  So basically, can you look at the- now in the 2018 Journal of International Sports Nutrition,
*  slide 32, Society of Sports Nutrition, because you like to say it's all about muscle protein
*  synthesis, right?
*  That's an important factor.
*  Okay.
*  It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of
*  20 to 25 grams of high quality protein.
*  About. The scribble is about.
*  About 20, 25 grams of a high quality protein.
*  High quality protein. Okay. Do you disagree that like eating four or five times a day
*  at 20 to 25 grams of high quality protein, whatever you want to take, high score, whatever,
*  under the scoring system you agree with, do you agree that that is the amount to
*  maximize muscle protein when it shows that that does for a four hour window,
*  acute muscle protein synthesis?
*  Yeah. Most of the sports organizations suggest that for acute protein intake.
*  Right. But if you- now again, I'm going with the consensus. So if you take that 20 to 25 grams,
*  four or five times a day, multiply that, what is that? That's 80 to 100, about 120 grams of
*  protein a day. Is that enough for a big athlete?
*  Or muscle protein synthesis.
*  Is that enough for like a 250 pound athlete? I would say no. So I'm not saying that it is.
*  I think you need more protein than that. Right? So-
*  Muscle protein synthesis is only one factor.
*  Right. Can you tell me what the other factors are?
*  Tissue regeneration and repair, recovery.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Okay. So I think we're on the same page that 20 to 25 grams has basically been shown
*  in a single sitting over a four hour window in what we call acute short term. That's been
*  shown to maximize muscle protein synthesis. And that is because 20 grams, and it's been
*  shown actually you can get less with like egg, you could get like 17 grams or something.
*  Because basically you're hitting two things. You're hitting leucine. You're getting 1.8 to 2 grams
*  of leucine, which is basically like a foreman. Right? It's like telling the others like, hey,
*  you should build protein. If you don't have any leucine, and if you had all the essential
*  amino acids you want except for leucine, you wouldn't have the foreman telling all the workers
*  to like build the muscle. Basically, that's what leucine is. So you're getting enough leucine and
*  you're getting 8 to 10 grams of essential amino acids. That is what is important in the acute
*  stage of muscle protein synthesis. You're getting 8 to 10 grams of, and we can get more granular
*  like it's 0.0 grams per pound of body weight, but this is basically accepted. And in fact,
*  they've shown that like even if you're 400 pounds, you probably don't need even more than 20 to 25
*  grams. For some reason, there's something in that number about getting the leucine amount. It doesn't
*  really matter how big you are. So there's a small percentage of people that say you might need a
*  bit more, 2.5 or whatever, but consensus is 20 to 25 grams. And I'm sorry this is long,
*  but it's important to break down. So by the way, just going back to your DS scoring,
*  you're basically looking at like rules for a Jiu-Jitsu tournament, like a Gi Jiu-Jitsu tournament,
*  and you're trying to apply them to MMA. So just because Jiu-Jitsu is involved in MMA,
*  it doesn't mean that a scoring system for IBJJF or whatever, that doesn't mean that that's the
*  best scoring system for MMA. Right? Is that fair, Jeff? Sure. Yeah, you could get points for like,
*  yeah, whatever. Okay. So essentially, and this isn't just my opinion, okay, this is scientific
*  literature, not an article that you just pulled on on examine.com, but that's not how science works.
*  You don't just pull up an article. So slide 33. And it's very clear, this is just very obvious.
*  It's not, it can't, it cannot just be about short term acute muscle protein synthesis, right? It
*  can't be because you wouldn't be hitting the 1.6 to 2.2. So this states, acute anabolic responses
*  are not necessarily associated with long term muscular gains. The topic can only be answered
*  by assessing the results of long-duteral studies that directly measure changes in lean mass with
*  the provision of varying protein dosages. Okay. So you agree that it's not just about short term
*  muscle protein synthesis. Okay. So what it is, Joe, it doesn't matter. At a certain point,
*  it doesn't matter because yeah, if let's say you're going to have four times a day,
*  and let's say you're going to have 160 grams of protein, and you have 40 grams, right? Of protein
*  four times a day, that's 160 grams. So if you're going to optimize muscle mass, and by the way,
*  like how much, how much muscle have you put on in the last 15 years? Not much. Oh, me? I'm like,
*  I put on none. Like basically, I'm about the same. But anyway, let's just say that you're a
*  bodybuilder and you're trying to stack on as much muscle as possible. Because that's like,
*  when I get like, I'm like 190, 193 maybe sometimes. If I go over 200, I just feel slow. I feel slow
*  with the handgun. I feel like I just feel slower punching, like whatever. So it's not everyone's
*  goal is to optimize muscle mass as quickly as possible. But let's say that your goal is,
*  clearly it's not enough to do that. You have to hit the 1.6 to 2.2 grams.
*  Right? Right. Once you hit that amount, you have to do two things. You have to hit the muscle,
*  the short term leucine threshold and amino acid in the short term. Right? And then you have to hit
*  the... What are you doing, Jamie? So you have to do two things. You have to maximize the muscle
*  processes in the short term, and you have to get enough protein during the day. Right? Of 1.6 to 2.2.
*  Is that fair? Okay. So once you hit the 1.6 to 2.2, let's say you have 40 grams, it doesn't matter.
*  You follow me? You even quoted... So it doesn't matter the amino acid profile of the food?
*  Is that what you're saying? No, because as long as you hit the essential amino acid amount and the
*  leucine amount in the... And you can hit the leucine amount and the amino acid amount in virtually all
*  of these vegan forms of protein? Is that what you're saying? No. No. If you're having... First of
*  all, you could do it with... If you do beans, rice, and vegetables, yeah, you'd hit two grams
*  of protein for 570 calories. Now, again, you could... You know that most athletes supplement, right?
*  Yes. I could have got slides if you wanted scientific proof, but you would accept that
*  elite athletes do even more. So it's like over percent... So people are supplementing with
*  protein powder anyway. They're supplementing with branched-chain amino acids because it contains
*  leucine, isoleucine, and phallus. Elite athletes are, yes. Well, no. Over 50% are supplementing
*  with protein powder and a higher percentage of... Athletes? Just athletes, period. Yeah. Okay.
*  And elite athletes are supplementing even more. It's probably more like 90. So if your goal is
*  to do something and take creatine or a protein, these athletic endeavors, like you pointed out,
*  the thing that Patrick does... And we can get into, by the way, the misrepresentation from
*  Robert Oberst into his Patrick's records, if you want, because there was a lot of claims that were
*  made that were completely false again. So basically, if you get enough protein, if you hit
*  one of the windows, if you hit the 1.6 to 2.2 with plant protein, you can hit the muscle protein
*  synthesis. And all of a sudden, he's like, oh, you got to... So you're saying there's no benefit
*  in animal protein for an amino acid profile versus plant protein? No, I'm not... Not if you're
*  getting enough protein. So you're saying if you're getting enough protein, there's no benefit. Okay.
*  I'm even talking about the... But if athletes are getting the right ratio of, as you have
*  acknowledged, of the right ratio of plant proteins. No, no, no. It's not difficult at all.
*  I'm talking about leucine. If you were really messing up and eating like people just don't eat
*  healthy, you might not get enough leucine. But if you're planning to become as big and as strong
*  as possible and you're dedicated, do you need a specific workout plan? But this is only assuming
*  that you're taking supplements, so we're assuming everyone's taking supplements to achieve...
*  No. No. I'm saying that... Not at all. No, you can do it with supplements.
*  Okay. But you're not assuming that people are taking supplements.
*  No, you can do it. But are you assuming that people are taking supplements?
*  No. You can... Following these guidelines. Okay. You can do it on a whole food diet,
*  plant-based diet with... With just food.
*  With B12. Just supplement B12, nothing else. You can achieve the same amino acid profile as meat.
*  Yeah. I mean, I want to touch on that. I'm not saying that the only thing...
*  But that is the argument, right? That was what he said.
*  But I just want to throw people off, like, depending on where you live,
*  you might want to supplement with vitamin D based on not getting enough sun.
*  Okay. Sure. I just don't want to throw out...
*  Everybody should do that anyway.
*  Anyway. Particularly D3.
*  Okay. So what I'm saying is, as long as you get that amount of protein... And again, if you're
*  exercising to optimally build muscle, you're exercising a fair bit, right?
*  Yes. You're burning more calories, right?
*  Right. So you eat more calories. And I don't know where my slide is.
*  We're deep into the woods here and this is getting really confusing.
*  No, I know. But the thing is...
*  The question was, and this is what his assertion was, that the amino acid profile of meat is
*  superior than the amino acid profile of glass. Yeah, it is. It is in context.
*  In context. That is what is
*  important. It's important when you look at the FAO and the goals that they're doing to try and
*  stop world hunger. It is not important in the Western world, number one, and not important if
*  you're an athlete and hitting the... You're getting between 1.6 to 2.0 grams per kilogram.
*  So what you're saying is that as long as you're getting this 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram
*  of protein, whether it's lentils or peanut butter or... That you have enough amino acids
*  to achieve the desired results. Yeah.
*  And it's essentially the exact same as if you're hitting that 2.2 grams...
*  If you're getting 2.2 grams, it doesn't matter. It's irrelevant.
*  Do you think that's true?
*  Uh, if you're getting 2.2 grams of protein and you're doing it and you're not doing it in the
*  way that you said where you're not planning it and not getting, making sure you're getting
*  enough leucine, which is low... Well, you wouldn't have to try...
*  It's low. Leucine, you're saying, is low in certain plant sources.
*  Yeah, I would say leucine is lower in... I agree.
*  But there's a certain quantity that you will achieve if you get those 2.2 grams.
*  It doesn't matter once you've got that amount. The other point that you had about protein
*  quality is digestibility. So that's the last point that I want to address.
*  Okay. How am I doing?
*  Good. Okay. So, slide 34, because you basically
*  claim that, okay, even if there are enough amino acids, you can't digest it as well.
*  The more precise data collected so far in humans assessing real specific
*  oral ilial nitrogen digestibility has shown that the differences in the digestibility between plant
*  and animal protein sources are only a few percent contrary to historical findings in rats or
*  determinations using less precise methods in humans. Okay. And just so you know,
*  I understand that you haven't seen this, probably, because it just came out last month published by
*  Stanford. So I get that you haven't seen it. Now, I'll take this one step further. There's only at
*  most like two or three percent different in digestible plant protein. And you know how it's
*  assessed in the pigs? They give them raw food. So they give raw beans, raw grains. And you have said
*  one of the reasons that it's less digestible is because of trypsin inhibitors. What happens when
*  you cook? You definitely break them down. Are you getting it? So when you heat food,
*  the likelihood is even though it hasn't been tested, we know that the digestibility is less
*  in plants by a few percent. Only a few percent. Not the foot 40 percent versus 100 percent that
*  he was claiming last time. That's old science. I'm talking about current science. Right? And
*  there's only a few percent difference. And they imagine that not only if you heated it,
*  that you would get equivalent, you might even get more because you're killing the trypsin
*  inhibitors by heating it. So that whole nonsense about the quantity you were wrong, the quality,
*  the score was not designed for that. It doesn't matter when you get enough protein. So as long as
*  you get enough protein, you're using measures for a organization that is looking at hunger.
*  I am. We're talking about if people have got enough. I agree. If you're in a developing country
*  and you have very little diversity of plant foods and maybe not enough in this manuals,
*  you should be eating the animals. I agree. But that is not what it was designed for. And it doesn't
*  matter. The amino acid profile doesn't matter. And the digestive doesn't matter when you get
*  enough protein. Let me pause you for a second here because you've been going on for a long time.
*  Yeah, I think that's really important. Chris, this has not been that good for your arguments.
*  So what are your thoughts on what he said so far? And what are your thoughts on what he's refuted
*  about what you had asserted about his show? I think he's made some good points. And, you know,
*  my original argument and what we started out talking about was, so you take the film and the
*  claims of the film, the specific claims of the film, and then you also take the question that
*  we started talking about, which was, is there evidence that 100% plant-based diet is better than
*  a diet that contains animal foods? You see what you're doing? That's really, you see what you're
*  doing. And there were a lot of claims in the film that we talked about, about, you know,
*  dairy products causing cancer, dairy products contributing to cardiovascular disease, chicken
*  and fish causing cancer, red meat clogging the arteries that we addressed and haven't had a
*  chance to go into detail on in this show. But there was a bunch of stuff that you did say.
*  Joe asked you about protein, and we were talking about protein, and what you just did there is you
*  segued into something else. So can you answer definitively, do you think I've presented very
*  good arguments against your rebuttal about both protein quality, including the amount and the
*  ratio, and about protein quality and quantity, including digestibility and amino acid scores?
*  I think the protein quantity is still an issue, or the question of getting.
*  How? I mean, you've got to have some logical arguments, Chris. I'm sorry, but you're like,
*  I have disproven your rebuttal on protein and on B12.
*  I think the quality and quantity still matter.
*  So even though that scale was developed for the FAO, there's still a difference,
*  a quantitative difference in the amino acid profile and digestibility.
*  I didn't argue with that. That was not my point.
*  But if it's about amino acids, and it's about protein content and digestibility,
*  if what he's saying is correct, then there really is no need to eat meat. That's what he's saying.
*  That is his argument.
*  For protein. I mean, you can come up with some other, like we can go at nutrient. If you want
*  to look at nutrient profiles, then we can look at that. But you've got to admit, I've presented
*  some good arguments in both favor of quantity and quality.
*  And I hadn't seen that last study from 2000.
*  And so I just want to sum it up. I want to sum it up by slide 30. Just one last slide on this.
*  Well, I mean, yeah, one last, well, I've got slides proving the outcomes as well. But
*  if you just want to look at it, this is not me. This is not me making up like a,
*  it's like, oh, I'm a vegan. I'm just making stuff up. Like there's a bunch of
*  bullshit that's put out by vegans about arguments that are totally terrible.
*  Agreed. Yeah.
*  Okay. And honestly, I think vegans are like the worst people for their own movement.
*  I agree as well.
*  Like throwing blood on people that are wearing like fur jackets or whatever. I think it's
*  ridiculous. Right. But that doesn't, don't, don't lump me in and the film in with vegans in general.
*  You've done a far better job of explaining things here than you did even in the film.
*  Yeah. But it's very tricky.
*  It's very tricky because you don't have that amount of time. This is worth three and a half hours in.
*  Right. Well, I would have made a 10 hour film and I, it was upsetting.
*  I'm sure you would have.
*  People say, oh, you, first of all, a couple of arguments that were made.
*  Half of the athletes you filmed, you didn't put in the film because they stopped being vegan.
*  Completely not true. You're also a bunch of experts we didn't put in the film that we couldn't put in
*  and we didn't put them in because there wasn't room. It was like,
*  in filmmaking, it's called killing your babies. There was amazing scenes that were being really
*  convincing that we couldn't put in. Like the evidence in the film is far less than 1% of the
*  evidence that I had. Why don't you guys do it as like a Netflix thing? Or you do like wild,
*  country where you do like seven hours. I would like we this, we're considering,
*  it's like a wiser thing to do because yeah, but I think like how many people are going to sit down?
*  You know, any people going to watch this? Well, I know I mean, I don't know how to watch the film.
*  Millions. So when, when we're talking about like, we don't really have that much time left,
*  unfortunately, cause we are here at three and a half hours in and I have another one
*  right after this, but what, what about the film? Do you think he hasn't refuted your criticism?
*  We just put that last slide. Yes, please. What is it again?
*  Slide 34. And also I've got a bunch of slides showing that actually, um,
*  Here we go. There's no research to suggest that protein recommendations are different
*  for athletes allow following a vegetarian diet than for those on an omnivorous diet.
*  Now that is the handbook, the textbook that is used when you become a board certified specialist
*  in sports dietetics. So this, what this is basically saying is what you said earlier,
*  that the amino acid profile, once you reach a certain point in a certain amount of grams
*  to reach that amount anyway, even with meat, that's the thing. Okay. So yeah. So, um, and again,
*  what about the film? Do you think that he hasn't refuted your criticisms?
*  I mean, we can go, I would love to,
*  because the thing is productive. That's going to be, there's the blood flow and endothelial
*  function. Oh, I'd love to get the meat and let's do it. Let's, let's do the erection scene.
*  The other one? That's the most scientific part of the movie.
*  What was it? What was the other thing, Chris? Well, I mean, just talking about inflammation
*  and endothelial function will take cancer and dairy, the chicken and fish and cancer.
*  I can refute all of that. All of your claims. Um, can we, do you want to look at the erection
*  and the dolphin scene? Cause they're related to endothelial function.
*  Let's why don't we talk about research about endothelial function. Yeah. Okay. Great. Okay.
*  That's related. So, okay. Endothelial. So, so regarding clothes with this, cause we're gonna,
*  but we're almost, it's already two 30. It's just a shame because like all the other claims he made
*  were false. All right. What other ones were false in the interview or in, uh, in this, in the film,
*  when you said, and I've seen you say this on interviews, we have 22 years of research showing
*  that a single high fat meal impairs endothelial function. That study was, uh, called, it was from
*  1997. So multiple studies and I can put them up if you want. So that's 22 years. Um, but you
*  started studying from the fact of a single high fat meal on endothelial function and healthy subjects.
*  So this compared a 900 calorie diet. Both were on 900 calories. One group was eating 50 grams of
*  fat and one group was zero grams of fat. The high fat meal was an egg McMuffin, a sausage McMuffin,
*  I'm not talking about those hash Browns and a non caffeinated drink off from McDonald's.
*  Yeah, I'm not talking about that. That's one. You just picked one. Well, what, which one are
*  you talking about? I got a bunch. Okay. Well, I got a bunch that actually contradict that. So, um,
*  that's the same study, the same researcher that did that study found that taking vitamin C and E
*  after the high fat meal completely eliminated the, the effect that it had on endothelial function,
*  which suggests that a healthy omnivorous diet with plants wouldn't have the same impact.
*  There was a 2019 review, uh, and this is, will be at Cressor.co slash game changers, adding nuts,
*  avocados, olives, berries, spice blends, orange juice, red wine, and protein, including milk
*  protein to a high fat meal prevents endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress. We've got, uh,
*  several studies that suggest that dairy and egg proteins improve endothelial function.
*  2015 controlled trial with 52 subjects, dietary proteins, including milk and egg, improved
*  endothelial function. 2006 study adding dietary protein to a high fat meal prevented
*  postprandial endothelial dysfunction. We have 2009 study followed subjects for 12 weeks,
*  a low carb diet improved endothelial function, whereas a low fat diet decreased it. Uh, 2007
*  study with a follow-up. Okay. We just, you know, I mean, we can go on and on and on. Okay. He just
*  is rallying on your study. All of these studies show that animal proteins don't, uh, increase
*  and decrease endothelial function. So you have to know more about nutrition.
*  And it's really in the plants in the context. Okay. So first of all, you just, you compared low carb
*  and high carb. I am not a, I'm not for health. I'm not promoting high carb. That wasn't the point.
*  The point is that low carb diets that contain animal products and that milk and egg protein
*  have been shown to improve endothelial function, not worsen it. Right. So the claim in the film was
*  that animal protein worsens endothelial function. Right. Because that is the scientific consensus.
*  And we keep going back to this. Tell us why, tell us why that is. I mean, I can join in.
*  Seafood consumption protects against endothelial damage. Seafood is an animal protein.
*  Mediterranean diet, which includes animal products, improves pulse wave velocity, blood flow,
*  markers of atherosclerosis. These are studies in the peer reviewed literature. Yeah. But we're
*  seeing what's wrong with this. So the industry funding studies, what you do, if you want. Wait,
*  who said anything about these being industry funded? No, but what you do is compare, everything
*  is healthy compared to what? Healthy or unhealthy compared to what? So if you have a low carb diet
*  and you replace the bunch of white sugar and flour, you might not see, it's going to, the outcome is
*  going to be a decrease. But the claim that was made in the film is that animal product, animal proteins
*  worsen endothelial function. I just listed a whole bunch of studies, especially those suggesting,
*  here's one that says influence of food patterns on endothelial biomarkers is a system systematic
*  review. The conclusion was that healthy food patterns, abundant in fruits and vegetables had
*  a beneficial impact on endothelial function, westernized patterns, higher intakes of processed
*  meats, sweets, fried foods, refined grains were positively associated with inflammation.
*  Makes my point. No, it makes my point, which is quality matters.
*  Yeah, quality matters. So if you get someone sausage McMuffin and egg McMuffins and you show
*  that- I'm not showing that. My studies are not showing those.
*  Okay, well, let's let him explain his studies. So for example, slide 71, I purposely didn't include
*  those studies because I don't think that they're a good thing to compare to. So slide 71.
*  Okay, this is nice because there's a graph, right? So you can see, so everyone's saying like that fat
*  in the blood, that's normal. Well, what do you mean by normal? Yeah, lots of people do that.
*  That's normal. That doesn't mean it's optimal when you see the fat in the blood. And by the way,
*  it was a film. We couldn't throw everything in. So when you see fat, that's called postprandial
*  lipema. That means after a meal, fat in the blood, right? That is associated with up to a 50%
*  decreased endothelial function, which means nest nitric oxide is produced, which means that the
*  arteries can't open up as much, less oxygen, less nutrients to the muscles. Okay? So that is
*  associated. As you can see in this graph, I don't know. So the solid line is the, the trig,
*  no, the solid line is how much your arteries are dilating, flow mediated facial dilation, right?
*  So as the triglycerides, this is after the meal, okay, which was by the way, a shake of whipping
*  cream and liquid chocolate and nonfat dry milk, okay? As you eat the meal, you can see that the
*  triglycerides go up. That's the fat in your blood. See between two and four hours, it kind of peaks.
*  We measured those athletes at two hours. And again, this is not just a film. It's been done
*  for over 20 years in the scientific literature. So as you can see in the graph, right, Joe,
*  as the dotted line goes up, that's the appearance of more fat in the blood, right? You get that
*  lactescence, the milkiness of the blood. You can see that very clearly that the flow mediated
*  dilation drops. So it drops by 11%. Okay? If you look, for example, does that make sense? So that
*  when you have those fat in the blood, your ability to your arteries to expand goes down.
*  There's no like what there's that's not an egg McMuffin. That is a milk and whipping cream.
*  And that's it. So now if you go to slide 73, now I agree this had some so they compare now they're
*  here. Yeah, we can skip to the next one. That was 11%. Okay, so here what I've done is the only
*  thing I changed about this graph is I put the green dots for the plant based meal and the red
*  dots for the animal based meal. So they were eating Korean barbecue, egg, milk, oil, mayonnaise,
*  rice and vegetables. And on the other hand, they were having a vegan meal of soup, kimchi,
*  vegetables, orange juice, apple. So it was matched for calories at 800 calories. The green is in red
*  and the sorry, the green is plants and the red is animal based. So I don't know if you want to go
*  into basically, I mean, you've slide 74. Again, please try to remember a lot of people listening.
*  Oh, sorry. Do you want to read the? No, you can if you want. But here changes of serum
*  triglycerides were negatively correlated with changes of FMD. Flow mediated dilation.
*  This is well, low carb diets often will lower serum triglycerides and they can not post-prondly,
*  not post-prondly, not post-prondly, not after the meal for which is important to test because that
*  lasts for six to eight hours. And what do you do again, you eat another animal based meal. So the
*  next part, Joe. This is good. Then how is it that triglycerides go down over time if
*  your body adapts to it? So Joe, can you read the second book? The study suggests that acute HTG
*  hyper triglyceremia is the fat in the blood, causes endothelial dysfunction via enhanced
*  oxidant stress and that and this may pave the way for the development of our, our thorough
*  sclerosis. And it's a mouthful. Atherosclerosis. Under chronic conditions. So what that's saying
*  like in the short, acute means short term and chronic is like long term. Under acute thing,
*  it affects your endothelial function, your ability to exercise and perform and in the long term
*  affects chronic conditions like heart disease. And if you go to slide 75,
*  remember that chart that we looked at with the green dots and the red dots.
*  8.2% decrease in FMD two hours following the animal based meal. 2.7% increase in FMD
*  two hours following the plant based meal. Okay. So you got less blood flow. So Chris makes out,
*  there's no science, no evidence. It was just this crazy thing that they made up. It was the
*  co-chair of the cardiovascular committee for the NFL that has been researching this for years.
*  I didn't say that James. I said there was a lot of other evidence contradicting it. So
*  if we want to bring up a study, you can, uh, but again, facts of dietary carbohydrate restriction
*  versus low fat diet on flow mediated dilation. This is what you've been talking about.
*  Because you're not comparing it to the diet that I'm suggesting.
*  Peak flow mediated dilation at three hours increased from 5.1% to 6.5% in the carbohydrate
*  restricted group and decreased from 7.9% to 5.2% in the low fat diet. 12 week low carbohydrate
*  diet improves postprandial vascular function more than a low fat diet.
*  Right. Because the low fat diet has a bunch of like white flour and stuff in it. That's the thing.
*  Often the low carb diets do to, to the diets with animal. If we're talking about protein,
*  the claim in the film was that animal protein causes endothelial dysfunction. Somehow we've
*  gotten off talking about fat and I've just, I've just mentioned many studies that show that,
*  that dietary proteins, including milk and egg improve endothelial function.
*  No, they don't.
*  Fish. Okay. They don't study right here.
*  No, but Joe, you can't just say a study, right? Because Chris can bring up studies that I can't.
*  Dietary proteins improve endothelial function under fasting conditions, but not in the
*  postprandial state with no effects on markers of low grade inflammation. This is in the greatest
*  journal of nutrition 2015 study. Okay. But dietary proteins doesn't even necessarily mean
*  animal based proteins, right? No, it says including milk and egg.
*  Including. Yeah.
*  The bottom line is that he can present any study. I'd have to dig into it. See the funding,
*  whatever, because it's always what's compared to. So you can show a huge benefit for eggs.
*  If you compare it to lard, right? You can, there's all sorts of things.
*  These were proteins that included soy, soy, milk and egg, and they all improved endothelial
*  function. And then another study showing dietary protein, milk or soy to a high fat meal,
*  prevented postprandial endothelial dysfunction. And then there are the two low carb studies that
*  I mentioned. There's controlled trial that found that a low carb high fat diet improved pulse wave
*  velocity, which is another marker of endothelial function. There are studies of the Mediterranean
*  diet, which is a healthy diet pattern that includes some animal products include improved
*  pulse wave velocity, seafood consumption protects against endothelial damage.
*  Yes, compared to beef, it does. Can I just say, like, for example, you said you were trying to
*  refute the study about the increased risk of cancer, colon cancer between vegetarians and
*  non-vegetarians, right? The three times increased risk for those who had white meat like fish or
*  chicken once or twice a week. And then you go to a meta analysis, which is not comparing,
*  you're comparing fish to bacon or beef, of course, comparing to that.
*  Comparing any that these are controlled trials that look at dietary proteins, milk, soy and egg.
*  But Chris, first of all, you have admitted that you don't even know how to read the science.
*  Is that fair? Do you honestly feel qualified to read even a single paper?
*  Yes. But you don't know how to read a forest.
*  I took a master's level research methodology class. So I'm referring to studies that are in
*  the peer-reviewed literature, James. And you haven't answered the question, like,
*  if protein impairs endothelial function, why are studies showing that milk and egg don't do that?
*  George Dilman did a study showing that, like, the heart rate went up when he did, like, a knockout
*  without touching someone. Just because you can show studies that I haven't had a chance to read and
*  dig into doesn't mean that my point is valid. The shame is true.
*  No, no. I gave, like, the film has been reviewed and has been accredited by the Defense Health
*  Agency. Right? Yeah, we've heard that.
*  Right. So you think that they, like, the science, you're basically, your, your, your debunk,
*  which you failed miserably to debunk the film, right? I have proven again and again that your
*  points were invalid. I have presented data with healthier meals. You thought I was going to go to
*  the feeding someone McDonald's. I didn't. I showed one with just basically dairy, just dairy,
*  increasing. And I've showed three or four studies with dairy proteins that don't, don't, don't
*  interfere with endothelial function and actually improve it.
*  The bottom, bottom line is, Joe, right, that at each step of the way,
*  Chris is not in line with scientific consensus. Okay? Not on protein recommendations, not on
*  definition of carbohydrates, not on endothelial function, not on heme iron. He's just not,
*  like, you shouldn't be having him on to say he's, he said himself he's not an expert in nutrition.
*  He is unable to read a, unable to read a single study and understand it. I am not qualified either.
*  That's a mischaracterization. Okay, then tell me, tell me with a
*  competent interval of, of this in the forest plots.
*  So listen, I'm presenting, I've never, I've never, I've not put myself out, like, I'm the expert that,
*  that is doing these studies, doing these studies in the same way that you did. You collected
*  information from the scientific consensus, which from leading researchers with thousands of years,
*  thousands of hours. Okay, go ahead.
*  There's, there are many experts that would disagree.
*  Yeah, but it's the same thing as, like, climate change or whatever.
*  No, it's not the same at all. It's absolutely not the same that there's the, the consensus
*  of experts that agree that we should be on a 100% or even 95% plant-based diet is the same as the
*  consensus on climate change. It's not even close to that.
*  Parallel is that the scientific consensus says that we should be in predominantly plant-based
*  diets and that vegan and veggie, even vegan diets are helpful for all stages of life cycle.
*  I've shown that you can get enough protein. I've shown that the quality DS scoring doesn't matter.
*  I've shown that the B12 stuff that you got is completely wrong. Like, what else do you want me
*  to show you? You want me to show you that, like, even despite having lower creatine levels,
*  because people have pointed out in the film, oh, you said as long as you get all the amino
*  acids, that's enough. You didn't point out that the study said, they didn't, oh, vegetarians have
*  lower creatine source, therefore it may affect performance. They didn't test it. I've got a bunch
*  of studies where it has been tested, where they had vegetarians and meat eaters had equivocal fat
*  free mass, equivocal power output, equivocal time to fatigue, despite lower creatine levels.
*  And we know that creatine is ergogenic. I've also got other studies showing that when vegetarians
*  actually take supplemental creatine, they get increased gains of over one pound of muscle
*  over the meat eaters. So despite lower creatine, which we know the most studied supplement,
*  They're getting that because their intake of creatine is lower.
*  Yes. And so when they take it, they're supplementing, they see a bigger response.
*  You could look at that the other way. You could say you should have more creatine in their diet
*  and then they wouldn't need to supplement with that to get the bigger response.
*  Right. But I'm saying it points out that despite lower creatine source, which we know are ergogenic,
*  which are performance enhancing, they still have equivocal fat free mass,
*  muscle and power output and time to fatigue. And when you add creatine in, you get a benefit.
*  Now I'm not saying that everyone should be taking creatine, but if you're trying to build as much
*  muscle as possible, I think you should. And by the way, meat eaters also tend to supplement
*  that trying to body build with creatine as well. So I'm saying that despite the fact of lower
*  creatine, which we know is the pro would you argue that's like the probably the most well studied
*  and best supplement that we know of that can help.
*  Muscle gain.
*  Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. So despite lower creatine, people on plant based diets can still
*  have as much muscle mass. And when they hate creatine, they get even more than the meat eaters.
*  And I've got a bunch of science to prove that too. So basically, Joe, if someone watched the last
*  episode where he tried to debunk the film for two hours and 50 minutes, do you feel that I fairly
*  addressed a lot of the critiques and I've going to address a lot more. He talks about nutrient
*  quality. He likes to refer to like diet quality says that we're lower in certain nutrients.
*  Yeah. Vegans are low typically in B12 and D calcium and zinc because they eat a bunch of shit.
*  But meat eaters are low in about nine. So he likes to point to a nutrient score,
*  which favors a paleo type diet.
*  That's not comparing equivalent vegans. Vegans and vegetarians in general are,
*  do, you know, they smoke less, they have a higher drink less, they have a higher diet quality in
*  general. So it's not comparing apples to apples.
*  Right. Cause they do all of the things that are better for health, including eating a plant based
*  diet. He thinks that just the only one thing that they don't do better is eat more plants.
*  Well, he's saying that you lump in meat eaters with people that eat the standard American diet.
*  When you say meat eaters, you're not talking about people who are eating organic.
*  But when we're talking about muscle gain.
*  Get 60% of their calories from ultra processed and refined foods.
*  But no, that's why they're nutrient deficient.
*  But that's what they are saying.
*  You just said that you're not comparing like Joe Rogan's and his diet versus an equivalent.
*  No, all I'm saying, all I'm pointing out is that you are saying that vegans are typically
*  more deficient in certain nutrients. They are in certain nutrients, but that's because a lot of
*  people aren't smart and don't like. So you're looking at the overall group of them versus the
*  people that are doing it as recommended by these studies that are showing the appropriate
*  amount of amino acids they're doing it. They're balancing it out and you're a variety.
*  You don't have to planning it. I don't even think about it. I don't count
*  on how much protein I'm taking. I just think a wide variety. And if a really good source,
*  actually, is nutrition facts.org. And he's got this useful thing called, yeah, he doesn't like
*  that because it's not in alignment. What's wrong with nutrition facts.org?
*  Oh, it's, it's just a, it has a very strong plant based agenda.
*  Well, because they follow the science. So anyway, forget all of the useful videos that are on there.
*  They do like three minute videos for people to learn about the science. It gives all the
*  references. But the useful thing, the really useful thing is it has like the daily dozen,
*  you know, about what all of the evidence is showing we should be eating. Whether you're
*  eating meat or not, all of the evidence showing like how much legumes, how much fruits, how much
*  vegetables, you know, flaxseed and, you know, these types of things. So it's just like,
*  it's like a fridge magnet you can throw in your fridge.
*  James made an excellent point. Chris, do you have anything to say in closing?
*  No, thank you for
*  I really appreciate the time. Sorry if it felt a bit combative.
*  No, you knocked it out of the park. You did a fantastic job. I mean, it makes me consider,
*  well, let me explain my position. Coming in here, I felt like you'd put your film out. I felt Chris
*  felt the same way. Having you in here while he debunked it was just going to be a waste of time.
*  You had put your position out. He was going to chance to do it. But I've also felt that would
*  be unfair to not have you come in and explain and refute his debunking. And I think you did
*  a fantastic job. I really appreciate that. And I'd love to come back on and talk about
*  whatever. Let's do that next time. Awesome. Okay. Thank you, Chris. Thank you. Bye everybody.
