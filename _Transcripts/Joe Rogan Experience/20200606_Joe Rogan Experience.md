# Joe Rogan Experience #1487 - Janet Zuccarini & Evan Funke
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUw8dqDHcB4)
*  And we're rolling. Janet, Evan, what's up? Joe, how are you guys? Good to see you. Good
*  to see you. Strange times. The weirdest times ever. Yes, but Felix is still intact. The
*  restaurants there. We were talking about restaurants that have been just destroyed over the rioting
*  and the looting and the chaos and you guys, you got lucky. You dodged a bullet. We did.
*  Very happy to hear that. Well, I think Abbot Kenny got a bit of warning and all of Abbot
*  Kenny boarded up and so we boarded up and the National Guard is still there today. What
*  the fuck? It's so strange. It doesn't make any sense. Like if you told me that something
*  happened in LA and people were rioting, I'd be like, well, if it happened in LA, it kind
*  of makes sense that people are upset. And then you said, but they're smashing businesses
*  and destroying restaurants and destroying small stores and family owned business. I'd
*  be like, well, wait, why? Why are they doing that? There's no rhyme or reason to this.
*  It doesn't make any sense. I understand why people are pissed.
*  Put that fucker up there. Evan, come on. We're just talking about it.
*  Evan. How's my level?
*  Good? Better? All right.
*  Yeah, it's, I mean, it is what it is. There's nothing we can do about it now, right?
*  Well, but I also think there's been, you know, thousands and thousands of peaceful protesters
*  out there. So, and the press is really not focusing on all the peaceful protests, which
*  right to protest. And there's going to be, you know, a bad apple everywhere. And then
*  you're going to get, you know, hundreds of people that, and I think you were saying,
*  you know, on your last podcast, it's a bunch of young people that don't know where, yeah,
*  where's your iPhone made? Where are you going to get your shoes made from? And they're not
*  thinking about that. They're just thinking free running shoes. And this is fun. And we've
*  been locked up and like, let's get out there.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the perfect storm of craziness, right? A disease we thought was going to kill everybody.
*  And then, so everybody shuts down and it turns out it doesn't really kill nearly as many
*  people as we thought, but we still have to be shut down. And then like, when do we get
*  to go back to work? And then all of a sudden, hey, you guys can open up. Like you guys got
*  no warning.
*  No warning.
*  No warning. I mean, I called Janet up when it happened and I was like, what? You just,
*  you get to open? Like, but it takes 10 days to get staff ready. That's what you said,
*  right?
*  And a friend sent me a text message. Hey, so are you open? I hear you can be open now.
*  And I mean, it was just dropped in the news before, you know, any, we could have any time
*  to prepare. And, you know, we don't have the staffing. You need, you need, we need at least
*  10 days to be able to open our doors.
*  That's really our biggest challenges is getting our staff back into the restaurant and feeling
*  comfortable in the restaurant with all these new regulations. And you have state regulations,
*  you have LA County regulations, you have city of Los Angeles regulations, and each
*  one of the documents are like novel length. So I'm sitting there at home reading all three
*  cross referencing, and we basically have to abide by the most stringent rules. So I'm
*  like picking apart each one. Okay. Trying to decipher what we can actually do. And then
*  on top of that, we're trying to get people out of their houses because they're scared
*  shitless to come back.
*  Are they though?
*  Well, the wild card is the clientele.
*  I think people are going to come back in droves. I think if you were open full capacity, you'd
*  be fucking sold out instantly. I really don't think there's any issue at all. I think there's
*  so much fear mongering going on. But I think the the actual attitude of people, way more
*  people are interested in going out than are interested in being locked up longer.
*  Well, I think it's like different, you know, groups of people. So you have young people
*  who want to go out and they don't care. And they'll, you know, see be seated at full capacity.
*  But if you have any kind of health risks, or you're older, you're not going to feel
*  safe to go out. And you know, the restaurant business, when you're even allowed to be seated
*  at 100% is a really, really difficult business. And I think the pandemic really showed the
*  inherent weakness of this industry that we run on razor thin profit margins. Now we're
*  allowed to be seated at 60%. So do we pay 60% rent then at that point?
*  Our costs don't go down, you know, right percent. We're still paying 100% of our costs, 100%
*  of our labor, 100% of our rent, you know, the cost of food doesn't go down. So we're
*  forced to become extremely creative. And there's one thing that I know about the restaurant
*  industry where we're highly adaptable, you know, we have to kind of play within this
*  game where we have to be unwavering on all of our standards, and then be completely adaptable
*  minute to minute from everyone's demands. And everybody literally expects perfection.
*  There's also this extreme lack of communication as to like what what the timeline they're
*  looking at and what will be the standards for you to be open 100%. The same thing with
*  the Comedy Store. The Comedy Store has no idea when they're going to be able to be open because
*  restaurants are open. And they're saying, well, aren't we kind of like a restaurant?
*  We serve food. And they're like, Yeah, but no one goes to you specifically for food,
*  even though they're sitting down, you can't be open. And they're like, but it's not a
*  nightclub meaning like a bar where everybody just mingles their seats like, isn't that
*  okay? And they're like, No, we don't think so. We don't know.
*  Well, but nobody knows. But nobody knows anything. We know that's why we have complete lack of
*  trust. Yeah, you know, and everything and, you know, politics and how the pandemic has been
*  handled and also handling the businesses mandating, you know, overnight that we close our doors
*  and go to zero revenue. But there's no mandates on how we operate with zero revenue, you know,
*  moving forward. How do we what do we say to our landlords who deserve to be paid? So but nobody
*  knows anything. And right now with opening, you know, the the health department, the it's a 17
*  page document on how you are supposed to open in a safe way. What do they tell you have to do?
*  Oh, man. Well, 17 pages, page one, let's start. We'll start at page one.
*  At the very basis of it, you know, there's, there's got to be an employee log, we have to take the
*  temperature of all of our employees when they actually enter the premises. We have to have a
*  log on that. Anyone who has direct contact with customers have to wear a face mask and a face
*  shield, a shield, 100%. Oh, on the client side, you have to wear a mask when you're not eating.
*  So that means if you get up to go to the bathroom in the restaurant, you have to put your mask on.
*  Oh, God, take it off when you get back to the table. That's so dumb. It doesn't make any sense.
*  And a lot of it is like completely ambiguous. Well, why would you have to wear a face mask
*  if you already have a shield over your face? Right? Well, I think there's, there's been some
*  reports. So many questions, you can get it through your eyes. Yeah, but you there's been reports that
*  you get it from touching things. And now they say you can't. I know, but they're just, you know,
*  they're saying everything. They're saying anything. Yeah. And you know, it's really,
*  it's on the honor system. You don't have to do anything in a restaurant. Really? Yeah.
*  Not policing is like, consider training your employees to do this. Consider this, consider that
*  let people take chances. Let them know if they want to come, let them people want to be able to
*  go to a restaurant, just sit down and actually eat. I have friends who drove to Santa Barbara
*  to go sit down. Yeah, I would do it. You know, yeah, it'd be exciting. Look, we flew to Texas
*  last weekend to look at houses and stuff. But we went to eat. We had this place called the Lonesome
*  Dove. Oh, it's fantastic. We ate like regular people sat down, ordered wine, whole deal. It
*  was amazing. Were you like, were the tables separated? Yes, they were less than full
*  capacity. The waiters all wore face shields. The people that greeted you at the door wore,
*  not face shields, they wore masks. The people that greeted you at the door wore masks as well.
*  You know, but it wasn't that bad. It was great. It was just nice to be able to go to a restaurant.
*  Yeah. I think, you know, people are dying to get out and we're going to see a lot of people that
*  are going to just, you know, run to restaurants, sit down in restaurants. But you know, there was
*  a poll taken. I know you love polls. Love them. I know you're like, who the fuck takes polls?
*  You get the opinions of morons. That's what polls are. Most morons think. Most morons think that
*  six out of 10 Americans will not feel comfortable, you know, sitting in a restaurant. I don't know.
*  I'm not sure how comfortable I would even feel sitting indoors where you come in with a mask,
*  but then you're going to eat, you take your mask off. And then, you know, Joe blow two tables over
*  coughs and then you're sitting indoors. Whenever you're inside, you feel like you're in a Petri dish.
*  Yeah, it's been that way forever and ever. I mean, just think about my dishwashers. Okay.
*  In the guidelines, those guys basically have to be in hazmat suits. They have to have full
*  protection, face shields and mask, and then have like, you know, what, what, uh, the equivalent of
*  like a painter's suit, essentially, because I get it. Those guys are spraying down people's spit,
*  like all day, eight hours a day. So I get it for them, but it's always been a disgusting job.
*  70% of being a chef is cleaning, cleaning. It's cleaning vegetables or cleaning up after people
*  or whatever. Like it's cleaning. So this, this business has always been disgusting.
*  And if you don't love this business to the core, it's terrible. Well, let's talk nice things. Let's
*  talk, let's talk about what you guys have put together is pretty remarkable because the food
*  there is so good. It's kind of ridiculous. Like your pasta's got voodoo in it. I don't know what
*  you're doing. And I guess it's because it's handmade, right? Cause one, the first time my
*  wife and I ate there, we sat right next to that open area where you can watch you guys make the
*  pasta. And it's such a painstaking process. And you, you realize you really truly appreciate that
*  it's an art form, you know, that like making stuff like that, like cutting no corners, making it as
*  good as it could possibly taste. Well, that, I mean, that's the ultimate goal is to create that
*  connection between pasta maker and someone who's eating the pasta. Like if you look through the
*  glass and you see a pastayo or pastaya in there, what's the difference? A pastayo is male,
*  a pastayo is female. So, you know, they're banging out Trofie, which is like a coil from Luguria.
*  And you look down at your plate and there's like 160 to 180 pieces in your plate. You're like,
*  fuck, this guy's repping. Yeah. He's got pictures of it. This guy's doing 180 reps just for me.
*  That's a connection. And once you get it, sometimes a bowl of pasta is a bowl of pasta.
*  I get it. But this is something different. This is, this is craft. This is tradition. This is
*  continuing this conversation of that's been passed down from generation to generation.
*  And all I'm doing, all we're doing at Felix is just a small spoke and a massive wheel of Italian
*  culinary tradition. Well, you know, just exactly how long to cook it too, which is amazing. Like
*  that, that's the bite. I get it, man. You must be. Cause the, just the way your teeth sink into it,
*  it's like everything is amazing. I like to call it tooth some, that's what all dente means to the
*  tooth. Is that what it means? Dental. Oh, okay. Yeah. Tooth some. So that's part of the experience
*  right. Is the right amount of chew. Just the amount of chew. Each pasta is cooked region specific
*  because they cook pasta very different in Naples versus Rome versus Bologna. What is the difference?
*  It's just preference is based on tradition. And the thing is this authenticity is very personal,
*  right? Your mom makes macaroni and cheese with Velveeta. My mom makes macaroni and cheese with
*  Tillamook cheddar. That shit's authentic to me. It may not be authentic to you. Italy is no different,
*  but the differences and the diversity are so specific, not only per region, but town and then
*  house to house. And it's, it's been that way for thousands of years. That's why I think Italian food
*  next to Chinese food is the most diverse there is. And you can literally study your whole life and
*  not even scratch the surface. Wow. Now you guys have been open for what? Two years? Three years.
*  Three years in April. How much prep time is there before you open? Like when you have a plan and
*  Janet, you've opened up how many restaurants? You're a ton. Nine restaurants and four under
*  construction. Great time to be under construction in the restaurant business. So crazy. My life sucks.
*  It could be a lot worse. No, right. When you are about to open up a place like Felix and how do you
*  how do you get started? Did you know Evan in advance? Did you guys talk before? Like how do
*  you how do you put together a restaurant like that? Well, each restaurant that I've opened
*  definitely has a different story. So I have a few Italian restaurants. I have Thai restaurants. I
*  have a Jamaican restaurant in Toronto. So, you know, all very different stories, but I wanted to
*  basically expand outside of Toronto. And I came to LA for lifestyle reasons to get out of the
*  Toronto winters and decided, you know, this will be my first place that I opened a restaurant outside
*  of Toronto. And I had a dream of being on Abbot Kenny. I just love Abbot Kenny. It feels like one
*  of the only streets in Los Angeles where it's, you know, like a neighborhood and a street that you
*  can walk down. So luckily, luckily, luckily, I, you know, found this location on Abbot Kenny.
*  And it's a long story, but I was working with another chef for about nine months. And then at
*  the 11th hour, I had the location, we were all set to begin construction. And he just said, I'm
*  going to, I've decided to go work with another restaurant group. And I was like, overnight, just
*  like left without a chef. And I only had one other name of another chef in LA. And it was Evan Funky.
*  And a food writer just sent me an email because I was just out meeting people saying, Hey, I'm
*  looking for a chef that has a following, a super talented chef. And this one, Kevin West, shout out
*  to Kevin West, sent me an email and said, Evan Funky is an amazingly talented chef and he's
*  available. And so when this other chef bailed on me, and I was on vacation at that time,
*  I was in Morocco, of all places. And I, you know, I asked for a week off to not to go off the grid
*  for a week. And then the president of my company contacted me, she said, you got to get on the
*  phone, we don't have a chef. And, and so I go, I have one name in my Rolodex, it's Evan Funky.
*  And I sent Evan, I felt that I had to send him a compelling email so that I could get his attention
*  because I had no other options. And I said, Evan, I hear Kevin West says you're an amazingly
*  talented chef. I have a location on Abbot Kinney, which is great. Like, chefs love
*  Abbot Kinney. It's a great street. And I said, time is of the essence. If you're interested,
*  here's, you know, check me out. I'm legitimate, a restaurateur, check me out. And, you know,
*  we were on a FaceTime call that dropped 1000 times because of the bad reception. I'm like,
*  bear with me, get back on a FaceTime call with Evan. And I flew Evan to Toronto.
*  I think it was Skype, actually.
*  Oh, was it Skype?
*  Yeah.
*  But I flew Evan to Toronto to cook for myself and my team immediately after this
*  vacation that I had. And Evan did just very few items. A lot of times chefs want to just like,
*  wow, you, I'm doing 22 dishes because I want to show you who I am. Evan did just, you know,
*  he just did his cacio e pepe pasta. He did his focaccia bread. He just did very few items because
*  he's confident and he knows. And I ate his food. My team ate his food. I said to Evan,
*  food cannot taste better. And I also described his food as Casalinga. So I lived in Italy for
*  eight years. My background, I'm half Italian. I lived in Italy for eight years. My father basically
*  was at the level of a chef, his cooking. And so I said to Evan, I said, your cooking is Casalinga,
*  which means like the housewife's cooking, like the mama's cooking. And Evan always described
*  his cooking like that, Casalinga, but not many people describe cooking in that way.
*  And so basically I think Evan felt that I got him. And then he just turned to me and he said,
*  you've got a deal. We're partners.
*  That's it.
*  Wow.
*  I was in Chicago at the time consulting for Rich Melman, Let Us Entertain You.
*  And I was kind of like on hiatus relearning the business. We'll probably get into that later.
*  But yeah, I got an email from Janet and I was like, all right, let's go do this. And that was it.
*  I cooked, I think I cooked four pastas.
*  So for you, like that's a, is it a rare thing to get an offer to run a restaurant or did
*  is there offers that you get that you turn down?
*  I mean, at the time it was rare. Now I get offers all the time.
*  Once Felix opened.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys nailed it. It's, it's crazy. You know, I learned from Bourdain
*  from watching his show, No Reservations, the first show, I was like, oh, okay.
*  I have a wrong idea of what food is. Like I had this idea that food just tastes good.
*  Like you go someplace, food tastes good. But then watching his love of food and watching his
*  deep respect for chefs and, and the preparation and all that's involved in making a dish,
*  I was like, oh, it's art. I didn't, of course it's art. I didn't think of it as art.
*  I thought of it as just food, you know, and then watching his show completely changed
*  my perception of what food is.
*  Yeah. Not, not every, not every chef operates from being an artist and there's different
*  levels of food. I do have to say, you know, Evan is an absolute master. You know, he's,
*  Evan's obviously not Italian, but has studied all over Italy and it's really the dying art of
*  handmade pasta. And Evan is a custodian of keeping this art alive. Like he's a maestro. He's
*  unbelievable.
*  Is there a specific type of flour that you use?
*  We import six different types from four different regions.
*  And now is the, the, the word about pasta and about bread and wheat in general is that American
*  wheat is a different kind of wheat.
*  It's a different kind of wheat. It's also processed completely different. I don't,
*  I don't use a lot of American wheat just because it's, it's just been manipulated so much and a
*  lot of the digestibility of, in my opinion, people are going to freak out, but in my opinion,
*  the amount of work that goes into denaturing pasta in order to get it flat via machine
*  has a lot to do with its digestibility. Just like sourdough bread is more digestible because it's
*  broken down on a different way. So handmade pasta is less manipulated than machine-made pasta,
*  in my opinion. So also the, the types of wheat, the amount of wheat germ that's in it,
*  the nutritional value, it all has to do with those elements within the, in the flour.
*  And to be honest, like I've developed a gluten intolerance because I've been breathing raw
*  flour for the past, you know, 12 years. So as soon as I step in, step foot in the lab and I
*  start rolling as folio, my stomach's just start, it's acid straight up. That's crazy.
*  Just from the powder. Yeah. Wow. Cause it's like talcum, you know, double zero flour is extremely
*  fine. So we have to throw it in order to, you know, put some on the table to roll it out. So
*  you breathe it in all day long. We've got extractors, we've got, you know, humidity control
*  and air conditioning and all that, but still. But so you've developed an intolerance because
*  it's called white. It's called white lung or Baker's lung. Baker's lung. So do you wear a mask?
*  I do not. Why don't you wear a mask? I don't know. Suck it. Like, like, I don't know. You know,
*  seems like that would be a good thing to do. Sure. But you don't want that Baker's lung, right?
*  I don't know. I don't like masks. Oh, okay. This whole experience is very,
*  it's been very enlightening wearing a mask. Right. Yeah. It's gross. I have another friend who also
*  has a Kozuku Kawamura who was instrumental in my kind of understanding of, of modern pasta. I met
*  him in Bologna, a Japanese guy who has a lab in Tokyo called a base. And he has the same thing.
*  He wears a mask all the time because he's just breathing in raw flour all day.
*  I never would have thought of that, but it makes total sense. I never thought, oh yeah. Hmm. Yeah.
*  I mean, fucking flour. It's like a guy works at a paint shop. Like you're going to get sick. You
*  got to get one of the painter things, the big tubes. That'd be so weird. People be like,
*  I'm not eating that fucking pasta. I don't know. For me, it's part of the experience. It's crazy.
*  What's in there? It's preservatives, man. Well, whatever you're doing, keep doing it.
*  It's the white lung, whatever you got to clean that shit out. Whatever it takes. I don't know
*  what you can do to get that. Can't stop, won't stop. Bakers lung. Just keep going. Yeah. It's
*  just, the pasta is insane. It's so good. And it's such a, when you have really good pasta and then
*  you have pasta that maybe you enjoyed before you had the really good pasta, it's like, it's really,
*  it's like having water in your ear. It fucks people up. Yeah. It fucks people up. It does.
*  Like I cannot tell you how many people DM me or come to me at the restaurant and they say,
*  you've completely fucking ruined me. Thank you so much. Now I can't eat pasta anywhere else.
*  And I don't eat pasta in North America whatsoever. I don't eat fresh pasta in North America.
*  I only eat pasta in Italy. I eat dried pasta in America, but I don't eat fresh pasta. Why not?
*  Most people don't know what they're doing. But there's gotta be some people other than
*  you guys. Certainly. Absolutely. Like what are good spots? Like if you're in LA. I think
*  Missy Robbins is exceptional. Where's that? New York City. Oh, Brooklyn. Brooklyn. Oh, okay.
*  Damn, you gotta go all the way to Brooklyn. You know, Rob Gentile in Toronto is great.
*  So this is a very small amount of people that are doing it right. I mean, there's a handful of
*  people who make pasta by hand, period. And even fewer people who know how to make pasta with the
*  mozzarella, which is the long rolling pin, even fewer. And when I started, I started doing this
*  11 years ago, there was nobody. There was nobody. I checked. You know, I moved to Bologna in 2007,
*  tail end of 2007, and started this journey with my maestra Alessandro Spisniglie,
*  Lavecchia Scuola Bolognese. And she kind of opened up the door for me to start seeking out
*  other pasta makers throughout Italy. And when I came back in 08, I ran a restaurant called
*  Rustic Canyon for about four years. And, you know, not a lot of people were serving the style of
*  pasta that I wanted to serve. So I started giving it away like a gateway drug. I was just like,
*  send it to tables for free. And they're like, what the fuck? And it just started gaining momentum,
*  gaining momentum. Wow. So when you moved to Italy to learn how to do like, what is it apprenticeship
*  like in, you know, learning how to make pasta?
*  I mean, it's an apprenticeship. You have to put yourself in the student's chair
*  and be a sponge. I didn't speak any, not a lick of Italian, but the Italians are very expressive.
*  So you're able to communicate through just being Italian, I guess. And I spent three months,
*  you know, six days a week, 10 hours a day, just making pasta. Wow. Period.
*  See, this is what's fascinating to me, things you just, you just take for granted. Oh, here is a
*  plate of pasta, like, but what what is involved in learning how to make it that good?
*  It's not just ingredients. When people sit down at a restaurant, people aren't just paying for
*  for the experience of sitting there and the cost of food, they're paying for the experience of
*  the people that are making the food. That's a big part of it. That's the way that I look at it.
*  And 11 years of making pasta by hand, there's a lot of depth that some of the younger guys just
*  aren't willing to pay the time cost. And a lot of the younger cooks out there, they bounce around
*  from job to job six months here, three months here, and they think that they've mastered it.
*  But there's just no depth. There's no depth. You know, you have to also consider how labor
*  intensive it is to, you know, hand roll out the pasta. And you know, what Evan was saying before,
*  like each one rolled by hand, you know, when you eat a bowl of pasta, you're not thinking that each
*  one was like pressed out by hand. So it's like, extremely labor intensive. And a lot of people,
*  when we were opening, Evan did have his own restaurant, bucato before, which was also
*  basically focused around pasta, as well. That's a whole other story. But when we were going to
*  open up this restaurant, and we put in the middle of the restaurant, the temperature controlled pasta
*  lab, which is taking up tables. So if you're a business person, a restaurateur, you say,
*  how many tables could fit in there? How much is each table worth to your bottom line? You're
*  using up that space to put in, you're using that space to put in a pasta lab. Are you crazy? Also,
*  you know, when you're thinking about, you know, training the people and how labor intensive it is,
*  people were saying, like, we're crazy doing this again.
*  They didn't think we could make money.
*  Yeah. Well, it is a lot of space. That pasta lab is a big space. But it's so cool to be sitting
*  right there. It's a showstopper. Yeah, it really it's it's something special.
*  And it's worked out. We're making money. I mean, we were making money. There's always like pre COVID
*  and, you know, there's no thought. There's no guidelines in terms of like, when you'll be able
*  to operate at 100% capacity. No, I mean, in the documents to say, it says they're going to
*  reassess in 21 days. So I don't know when that's going to be in a couple of weeks.
*  It might even be quicker than that, right? I think the economic pressures
*  are probably what forced them to open without letting anybody know.
*  They're out of money. Everyone's out of money.
*  Yeah, they can't just say, you know, there is a balance between people's health and the economy,
*  and they can't just shut everything down and say, well, we're just going to print a bunch of money.
*  We're all going to be paying for this in the end, right? Right now, it's been two trillion dollars,
*  you know, because of COVID. They have to get us back up and running and working. And I've said
*  from the very beginning, get your young and your healthy back out and working. And if you're over
*  the age of 65, or if you have underlying health conditions, and you should definitely stay at home,
*  and you have to wait for either a treatment or the vaccine. But, you know, they have to open up
*  the economy and it's been ridiculous how it's been handled. Yeah, that's what should have been done.
*  It should have been they should have, I mean, instead of taking this blanket approach.
*  But I think there was a lot of misconceptions. They thought it was going to be something different
*  than it was. Even at 60%, though, at least at 60%. I'm like, happy you're going to be able to be
*  in when you guys going to open up Monday? Have you figured it out? Well, then we were in the
*  protest and we had to board up and, you know, I think we're probably another week or so away,
*  at least it's really about getting staff back in that that's our kind of so once the protest die
*  down, then a week. Maybe a little more. Maybe a little more. But even with the 60% capacity,
*  it's we will see if we'll be able to maintain, you know, and actually not necessarily make a profit,
*  just stay open. Yeah, I think the goal has always been when this first started was, you know, your
*  goal is to survive and to get to the other side of this. You're not thinking about making money.
*  And when you see these like iconic, legendary restaurateurs like Daniel Hume with 11 Madison
*  Park, which last year was the number one restaurant in the world, and he does not think that he will
*  be reopening. So he might be closing permanently, or David Chang closing two restaurants, one in
*  New York City, one in DC, and then he's moving another restaurant, consolidating his company,
*  essentially. And when you so when you see these iconic restaurateurs that are struggling to make
*  it to the other side, it's like extremely sobering. And, you know, some some experts will say
*  they think 50% of restaurants will not make it to the other side. I don't agree. But I think 25%
*  won't make it. And even in LA, you know, one of my last dinners was at Bon Temps in downtown LA,
*  Lincoln Carson, an amazing chef, I was blown away by the restaurant, and he's closed permanently,
*  like all that time to open all that capital to open, you know, you train, whatever you're training,
*  5075 people to open and he's closed permanently, or Auburn, another restaurant was getting, you
*  know, great accolades closed also permanently, they just got a finalist in the global design awards.
*  So they're getting these awards. And they're closed permanently. And, you know, so, you know,
*  it's really survival of the fittest right now. So new restaurants, because it's so hard, this business,
*  you're very vulnerable when you're a new restaurant, and you just have debt, you're just
*  looking at a bunch of debt, and then you're closed permanently, you know, you're going to you're not
*  going to make it to the other side. And if a business was not making that much money, so when
*  you see a restaurant in New York City, like Lucky Strike, that's been there for 31 years, closed
*  permanently, because, you know, it just wasn't doing that well. So all the businesses that were
*  just kind of teetering are not doing very well, they're going to close, it's survival of the
*  fittest, even with the pandemic and hitting older people. It's kind of like all around in business,
*  it's survival of the fittest. It seems like it's so hard to believe that if you don't make money for
*  three months, it goes under, you would think like, oh, this is a successful business, like,
*  it's exposed people to the realities of running a business and how incredibly difficult it is
*  just to stay open. It's a juggling act, especially for restaurants, right? Especially. No, this is
*  what I was saying before is the pandemic really exposed the restaurant business and the restaurant
*  business probably has been hit the hardest. And then next, all small businesses and retail,
*  and then we're going to see commercial real estate really be affected right now. But the
*  restaurant business, the national average of the profit margin is 4%. That's the national average.
*  We don't operate that way. We operate at 14%, essentially. But 20 years ago in the US, most
*  restaurants would make 20, 25%, the net profit margin, but it's gone down, it's gone down. And
*  really, the business is broken. The restaurant business is broken. We should be charging a lot
*  higher prices, but then you're not going to get the customers. So what you do is you just accept
*  a lower and a lower profit margin. That's why this business is so difficult. And even 10 years ago,
*  you might have a runway in your bank account to survive a few months, but most restaurants,
*  they have a month and then they're done. They've got nothing in the bank account.
*  It's a horrible business. Nobody should be in the restaurant business, unless you're crazy and
*  you're so passionate about it. That's you. That's me. It's both of us. But I will- It's all of us.
*  11 million of us. Yeah. Well, 11 million of us. And then you think, when you look at the supply
*  chain, so we, the restaurants employ 11 million people in the United States, but then when you
*  add in the supply chain of the farmers and the winemakers and the linen cleaners and,
*  you know, we employ 20 million people and we're the second largest employer in the United States
*  next to the Pentagon. So, you know, right now we have to think- Wow, that's crazy. Restaurants are
*  the second largest employer and the Pentagon's the first? Yeah. How creepy is it? The Pentagon's the
*  first. Jamie, Jamie, look it up. I don't think like Amazon would be ahead of the Pentagon. What the
*  fuck? No, that's a nutty number. Pentagon number one employer, restaurants number two.
*  That's so insane that Pentagon's number one. I would have never guessed that in a million years.
*  If you gave me a multiple choice, I'd be like, fucking Pentagon. No way. Jamie's typing away.
*  I'm sure it's right. I mean, you don't have to even look it up, Jamie. I believe her. Who knows?
*  I just read things, but, you know, that's what we're talking about in the independent restaurant
*  coalition. You know, we're working together with the government to ask for a certain amount of
*  help, right? We need the right help. Or, you know, when people think, you know, screw you,
*  restaurants, like we're all in trouble, right? With 40 million plus now, it's like, I think,
*  42 million filed for unemployment. A lot of people are hurting right now. So it's hard to say,
*  you know, romanticize restaurants right now, come back and support your local restaurants,
*  when a lot of people are hurting. But I think if we think about the economic domino effect right now
*  of essentially 20 million people, we need help to stay in business and not close down permanently.
*  I think the economic effect right now will be staggering. Yeah, no, it's something to consider
*  when you think about what you said about the people that clean the linen, the people that make the wine,
*  all the various people that rely on restaurants. You don't, you know, it's not just restaurants,
*  you don't, most people like myself don't really consider that. You go, wow, they probably employ
*  10 people or 20 people or 50 people, whatever it is, but then you don't think of all the trickle
*  down. That's a massive web. A massive web. Do you see like the farmers obviously dumping,
*  you know, tons of food and 36 million gallons of milk, and nobody knew that restaurants are
*  the number one purchasers from farmers, that and institutions, schools, institutions,
*  and restaurants. And they process the food in a different way for restaurants than they do.
*  You can't just say like get the food, you know, out there. They process food differently for
*  individuals and grocery stores as they do institutions and restaurants. So they have
*  to dump all this food. Now, when you guys get up and running, how do you calculate how much food
*  you buy? Like that's always, I've always been like, how do they know? Like how do they know
*  how many people are coming in? Voodoo. The one good thing about the restaurant business is that
*  the metrics, the metrics, whether you have five tables or a hundred tables are the same. It's all
*  math. And if I knew how much fucking math that I'd be doing right now, I'm 40 years old, if I knew
*  when I was like a kid, I would have studied the fuck out of math because I had to learn on the fly.
*  So you as a chef are not just responsible for putting together the meals, but you also-
*  That's not enough anymore.
*  Not enough.
*  No. You got to be a businessman. You have to be a marketer. You've got to be a diplomat. You have
*  to be a father. You have to give advice, you know, like that. I'm not having kids, but I have 60 kids
*  because I exercise my fatherly duties on a daily fucking basis. I've bailed guys out of jail. I've
*  given beer money to guys. It is a true, true, true family. And you spend the majority of your
*  day with these people.
*  You feel that when you go into your restaurant though. There's something about that place.
*  When the waiters deliver your food, you know that they know it's special. There's a feeling,
*  when they put that down, like, here you go, look at that. And you're like, whoa.
*  It's by design. You could tell.
*  By design. The fish stinks from the head down.
*  Oh yeah. That's a Jamaican saying. The fish rots from the head down.
*  So Janet, we were talking on the phone about what it's like for you to have all these restaurants
*  under construction and you were this unstoppable machine. You're a restaurant machine. Everything
*  was kicking ass. And then all of a sudden, ah!
*  Yeah. Well, you know, the only thing I've ever done has been in the restaurant business and out
*  of university. I came from Italy and I opened my first restaurant in Toronto and slowly.
*  Right out of school.
*  Well, I was older. I took my time in school too. I started when I was, I started university when
*  I was 22. So I took my time. But when I opened my first restaurant, I definitely connected to a
*  passion and I had this slow route of growing this company. So that restaurant opened 24 years ago
*  and is still running, you know, still running today.
*  That's incredible. What are the odds of that?
*  Well, the average, you know, after you pass a year, you know, you have a lifespan,
*  most restaurants have seven years. So I've had a few lifetimes with that restaurant. And then I
*  slowly saved my money and wanted to buy the real estate where that restaurant is. It's in Yorkville.
*  Do you know Toronto? You know Toronto. Do you know Yorkville?
*  No, I don't.
*  It's a nice little neighbourhood in Toronto and I wanted to buy this real estate. So I saved my
*  money to buy the real estate. So I was, I was very cautious growing the company and building a
*  foundation. And then I bought one piece of real estate. Then I bought another building and then
*  I put another restaurant twice as big as my first restaurant. And then I bought another building.
*  So I've been buying these buildings and putting restaurants inside the buildings
*  until I felt that my foundation was so strong that nothing could happen to me.
*  So I could only put through the lens back then in the, you know, before the pandemic to say
*  in an economic upturn, people will eat pizza. On an economic downturn, people will eat pizza.
*  I'm untouchable. That's how I felt. I felt nothing could touch me. And then we opened up Felix and
*  Felix has gotten, you know, incredible accolades, you know, in the press and rightfully so. And
*  Evan's cooking is off the charts. And I thought, you know, we're ready to really grow. So let's,
*  let's do this. And I built a company where, you know, I have a head office. It's a proper company.
*  And I have an incredible team of people and I felt very ready and very stable and with an
*  incredible, incredibly strong foundation that I said, we're ready to do this. And so 2020 was my
*  big year to open five restaurants in one year. Wow. So I just, I just, just before the pandemic
*  flew to Toronto to open a 9,000 square foot restaurant to immediately close it. And that
*  cost $9 million to open this 9,000 square foot restaurant that opened one day, trained 100 people
*  for two months, and then immediately shut that down, shut down all restaurants. So shut down
*  eight operations. And I also have a catering company. So shut down eight operations in Toronto
*  and a catering company furloughed 700 people. And then I have four other projects under construction
*  and personally all of the money in the company out on construction sites. Plus I personally
*  loaned all of my money to build the restaurants because that's what, that's what I do. What I do
*  is I buy, I buy buildings and then I get mortgages on the buildings. Then I use all the cash that I
*  have anywhere that I can find it to open restaurants. So I might have a temporary, you know,
*  lack of cash, but then, you know, backed by a very strong revenue. So I'm funding all the
*  construction sites by all these restaurants that have extremely strong streams of revenue.
*  So once again, I didn't feel like I was taking a big risk opening five restaurants in 2020. So
*  I swear to you that the day the pandemic happened, I had to shut down. It was literally the day before
*  I loaned out, I wrote a massive check for one construction site, like all of my money in my
*  bank account, you know, out to one construction site. Then we shut everything down. And it was
*  like I was, I was kicked in the teeth. Like I was brought to my knees and I had never felt stress
*  like that because of how conservative I am and how fiscally responsible that I've always been
*  and feeling that I was untouchable. I just thought, you know, nothing could ever happen to me in this,
*  you know, I could never risk anything. But I woke up one day when I had to close everything down.
*  And first of all, the feeling of laying off 700 people, when you know, the majority of your
*  staff live paycheck to paycheck was absolutely heartbreaking. And that I ran the real risk of
*  losing everything, not only all the restaurants, but all the buildings, because the bank, you know,
*  owns my buildings, I don't own the buildings. And, you know, this pandemic caught me with my
*  financial pants down. Like I just was like, Oh my god, this is really bad timing for me.
*  Do you think if there's a second wave, they're going to try to do this again?
*  Shut you down? No, I think we're gonna look the protest, do you think we're gonna have a second
*  wave now? We very well could. I mean, we are people are not social distancing, they're on top
*  of each other. If anybody's got it, everybody's got it. I don't I actually don't think so. And I
*  think that we have we're going to be living with this virus. And I've said this from day one, when
*  this happened, I said to my team, give me the two year plan, what's going on for two years, we have
*  to live with this for the next two years. And I think that we just have to live in a safe way. And
*  yeah, wear the masks out. And we're going to go to restaurants and people are going to be wearing
*  gloves and masks and maybe take your temperature and we're going to see, you know, be seated six
*  feet apart. I think this is we're going to just find a safe way to live. But of course, there's
*  going to be there's going to be a second wave and a third wave, it's going to keep going until
*  till that but also when a vaccine comes, you have to that you have to inoculate, you know,
*  between 1680% of the world, how long is that going to take? We're living with this.
*  Yeah, the vaccine is a weird vaccine to you. Do you understand what it is an mRNA vaccine? Well,
*  that's one vaccine that Moderna is making, but there's different types of vaccines that they're
*  making. There's multiple trials that are going on right now, right? 100 different vaccines.
*  Everybody's trying to get out officials, no new COVID-19 cases from Missouri parties.
*  No additional new Well, you know, what's interesting is what we were talking about
*  before the podcast, when you guys were getting tested for the COVID, we were talking about Italy,
*  how Italy has the detectable levels are so small, they're so minuscule,
*  infinitesimal. I just learned that. There was a struggle earlier.
*  The viral load is infinitesimal. Well, sometimes when you read things, you don't say it out loud.
*  And then you say it out loud for the first time, you're like, I don't know how to say that word.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of words like that, that I never use. But yeah, in San Rafael, a hospital
*  in Milan, you know, they're saying that the virus is no longer exists in Italy.
*  That's so crazy. So just burn through the population. Well, hopefully that's what's
*  happening here. Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, and we're going to see in two weeks, right? Two
*  weeks, you're going to see what happened from all this protesting and everybody being on top of each
*  other. Also, the stress of it all has got to be terrible for people's immune system as well.
*  Yeah, I mean, sure. Like, are you feeling like we were talking about it earlier? If you're,
*  if you're a human being and you have any feelings at all, you're going to feel the stress of
*  humanity right now. You know, the stress of the world, because in our lifetimes, we've never seen
*  one of these events. But it's like we have the Spanish flu and the Great Depression and the 1968
*  riots happening all at the same time. Yeah, I think bigger than the 68 riots. I don't think
*  any riots have ever been this widespread through the entire country. And the looting. Well, the
*  Rodney King, I think they had they had a lot of deaths, right? I think they had a lot of deaths
*  in Los Angeles, but they didn't. They didn't protest the Rodney King riots in Boston. You know,
*  I mean, this is worldwide. This is worldwide. Yeah. And worldwide. The looting, though, seems to be
*  only here. And the looting is just insane. Well, in Toronto today, it's actually quite peaceful. But
*  they have, you know, well, they've supposedly tomorrow, there's some organized looting happening
*  tomorrow. June the 6th. And, you know, and these piles of bricks are showing up around the city as
*  well. Yeah, we were talking about that. Like, that's that's so weird, like big pallets of bricks
*  that are dropped off on areas like and no one really has any understanding of why there's been
*  a bunch of articles written on it. And they're trying to sort it out. And some of them are just
*  coincidence that they were at construction sites and the bricks happen to be there. And some of
*  them, there's no reason whatsoever for the bricks being there. What do you think as much as as every
*  single building has a camera on it? Yes. Wouldn't you be able to see who's dropping this shit off?
*  Yeah. It's like here's some writing supplies. Right. Have at it. Yeah. Well, the real fear is
*  that it's the police. People are worried that the police are doing it, encouraging people to
*  throw rocks. So if those people throw rocks, then the police can come in and break up what would have
*  been a peaceful protest. That's through the actions of agent provocateurs or just giving
*  people rocks and encouraging them, you know, just by virtue of the fact that rocks are there.
*  There was another thing that we talked about the other day. We should probably correct that now.
*  There was stacks of bricks in front of this synagogue. And we thought those stacks of bricks
*  were also the same thing sort of left there because people were protesting. But it's actually even
*  grosser. The stacks of bricks are there to keep people from driving their car through the synagogue.
*  So that's the synagogue set it up that way just to keep people from smashing through their windows,
*  you know, after some of these hate crimes. So it's like this is a world in pain. It's a fucking crazy
*  time. I am I am an internal optimist. And my feeling is that this is a terrible moment for us,
*  but a good one because I think it's big enough that we're going to change. I agree 100%. Yeah,
*  there's a real chance, real chance that people are going to change. Yes, I really think that.
*  And you're seeing like there was a video I was watching today of a girl having an argument with
*  a racist father and she filmed it. Do you see that? Yeah. That kind of stuff gives me hope like a kid
*  who's raised by someone who's got some racial prejudice and the kid doesn't, you know, and the
*  attitude of kids today, the attitude of young people today is so much more tolerant than any
*  other generation before. And it's so enforced. It's a culturally enforced tolerance. And I hope
*  it's for everything. I hope it's for all races, all genders, all sexual orientations, all everything,
*  everything, just we can be better. We can be better. And like it takes something like this
*  to make everybody realize like there's some fucked up aspects of our society. They need to be corrected
*  and there needs to be some serious refocusing of what it takes to be a police officer and what
*  police officers can and can't do and what the punishment is and who's responsible. And then if
*  you're a cop and you see someone do something horrible that's also a cop, you got to step up.
*  You got to do something. We can't do this anymore. Did you see Chris Rock's post from three days ago?
*  There's some vocations. You can't have a bad apple. He's like police officers. Police officers are one,
*  you can't have a bad apple. Just like you can't have a bad apple as a pilot. You can't like some
*  of our pilots like to land. Others like to go into mountains. We can't have this. I mean,
*  I feel I'm also extremely hopeful even if I feel like I've been brought to my knees and I'm seeing
*  other small businesses and friends of mine getting looted right now. And I'm like, it's also senseless.
*  And I feel for Black Lives Matters right now is like the most important thing. I didn't think
*  anything could knock off the pandemic, but it has. We're all thinking about this, but I do feel that
*  it's been an awakening. And I think that it's in our face like it's never been before. And I think
*  what you were saying to witness a man essentially be tortured is something we can't unsee. And I
*  think it changes you forever. And what you were also saying is for this one man to reverberate
*  all over the world, really to see the protests all over the world is really something. And I think
*  we have to be super uncomfortable for change. And I think this is a moment. And I think that cop has
*  been doing that shit since the beginning. He's been charged with multiple time, multiple complaints
*  since like 2006. And how crazy is it that one kid, a 17 year old girl, films this, puts it out on the
*  internet and it changes the world. This one time. Imagine if he knew. Imagine if he had any inkling
*  that leaning on that man's neck with his knee for eight and a half minutes or more even, almost nine
*  minutes, that that was literally going to change the world. I know it's unbelievable. It's a strange
*  time. It shows the absolute fundamental core of law enforcement across the board is absolutely
*  fucking rotten. And you just need better training and we need people who are not fucking assholes,
*  not racist pieces of shit going into law enforcement. It's also the job I think is almost
*  impossible. Just from a, just for your mind. I don't think people are supposed to be inundated
*  with that kind of violence. No man, they for sure have PTSD. I mean, just think about it being on edge
*  all day long, not knowing whether or not someone you're going to pull over is going to fucking kill
*  you. Yep. And vice versa. And just the amount of dead people they see, the amount of bullet wounds.
*  You know, I have friends that are cops and they tell you horror stories every day. It's a shotgun.
*  But so can the surgeon. It's really the same thing. So maybe the reform has to be that
*  mental health has to be looked after. But there needs to be a different way. There needs to be
*  reform. There has to be a different way. There needs to be different training. Yeah, it's not a job like,
*  you know, you could be a garbage man. Okay, I'll show you how to do the garbage. No,
*  it's like, who are you? Let's sit down. Mike, why do you want to be a cop? You know, like,
*  it should be a really difficult thing to get a license to be a police officer. It should be the
*  most difficult thing to do. It should be the most difficult job to get. And should be paid really
*  well. Yeah. Yeah. We have, you know, just look at all the systems and it's all broken. Like when
*  we look at the restaurant business, it's actually a broken business. Our society is broken and that
*  we pay teachers hardly anything for doing such an important job and police officers and people who
*  are working on the front lines. And you're mentioning that, you know, the kid that's stalking
*  the shelves and he's putting himself in harm's way, making minimum wage. It's all just doesn't
*  make sense. Yeah. Well, before it used to be just a job. Now you're risking your life. You know,
*  if you work in a supermarket, it used to be, oh, you know, I got a good job stalking the shelves.
*  Now it's like, oh, I could die from this. Like that wasn't on the menu when I first signed up
*  for this. Yeah. Restaurant business is the same now. Yeah. Right. Now it really is. Cause if people
*  are serving people and people are coughing on them, vitamin D kids, get your vitamin D, vitamin C,
*  make sure you take your zinc. Get your body healthy. But they don't, they, again, I'll say they don't
*  know, they still don't know enough about this virus. And, you know, every day you wake up and
*  you're like, oh, you know, your blood type. So I have blood type A and that's supposedly,
*  you'll have a rough time. You know, you have a higher chance of having a rough time needing
*  oxygen. If you have type blood, you know, blood type A, we're just, we don't know enough about
*  the virus. That's been like the most frustrating. And for me at least the most frustrating and the
*  most depressing thing is the literal like hour to hour changes of everything. And making long-term
*  decisions is literally impossible. And in this business, you have to make long-term decisions.
*  You have to project in order to be successful. And that's what's been so difficult is that,
*  you know, just the other day there was curfew was at six. I was in the grocery store. It was
*  curfews at six. And then all of a sudden, oh, we changed it to five. And then all of a sudden
*  everybody in the grocery store was working there. It's like, fuck, we have to close in 30 minutes.
*  And they're like letting everybody who's in line outside in. Oh, girl. All of a sudden it's packed.
*  So all the social distancing for people waiting, they just gave it up. It's not really that
*  important. What's really important is get your food quick. It's just, it's been bananas. Now,
*  when you like, so you have to do all these calculations when you're, you're figuring out
*  how many meals you're going to serve, how much food you're going to order. And you have to kind
*  of guess. Like, how do you, do you guess like how many people are going to order fish? How many
*  people are going to order steak? It's kind of, you get of, you have pars, obviously, but you get into
*  this rhythm and Felix, I'm a student of consistency and I always have been. I learned it at Spago.
*  Spago is probably one of the most consistent restaurants in the entire country. And my mentor,
*  Lee Hefter kind of instilled in me those principles that define the way that I run restaurants now.
*  So you have, obviously have pars, but you have to look at PMAX. You've got to look at what you're
*  selling. You have to look at what people are enjoying, what people aren't buying. And you
*  really ultimately have to know your clientele. You have to get to know them very much. So, and I think
*  that that's a lot of what hospitality professionals are really missing is that connection to the people.
*  Because that's the reason why we do this shit is to see you, Joe Rogan, eat the steak at table 33
*  and say, fuck, that was the fucking best steak I ever had in my life. It was the best steak I've ever had.
*  Really was. Yeah, all this talk about pasta, but really when you came here on the carnivore diet.
*  Well, that was the second or third time. I was surprised you ordered pasta, dude. That you had come. Okay.
*  When we had dinner together with Brian Callahan and my buddy Alex Enchin,
*  the four of us had dinner and you were on the carnivore diet. Yeah, I was then. Yeah.
*  But even then, I mean, the steak was fantastic. All the food was fantastic. But the second time
*  I went after that, right before you guys got shut down, my wife and I ate there. That was the last
*  service, no? I think so. I saw you there that night. I had just flown in from Toronto and that was my
*  last time out. I think that was your last time out. That was March 13th. Did you hear it? Yeah.
*  You outed. I outed myself. You Canadian right there. Yeah, I had pasta that time. It's sensational. But
*  that's till this day is the best steak I've ever had. What are you doing different? What are you
*  doing? How do you cook and steak? Salt. Talk to me. Don't lie. Salt, black pepper, hot fire.
*  That's it? Violent fire. It's where the meat comes from. Really? I mean, you have to,
*  you know, in my opinion, 90% of cooking is ingredients, 10% technique. Yeah. That's it.
*  So just buy the best you possibly can and try not to fuck it up. You need some instruction. You need
*  some technique. But a lot of people, I think the biggest ingredient that is missing in a lot of
*  cooking today is restraint. Restraint. Don't fucking manipulate it. Just let it do what it does.
*  The farmers have taken great pains. The ranchers have taken great pains to get this product to
*  where it is, to where it's ultimate. It's peak of perfection. It's peak of ripeness. It's peak of
*  marbling or whatever. Just put some salt and some black pepper on it and apply heat and then watch
*  it. And you kind of have to have a little bit of an internal calibration to understand what's going
*  on. Do you use a timer? No. All by feel. Why are you laughing? All feel. Well, you can mock me.
*  You can. No. I mean, listen. It's funny. We use scales. We use timers. But to cook meat, you have
*  to do it a lot. Repetition is the mother of all skill, whether that's pasta making or cooking on
*  the grill. Do you use an internal, do you use any sort of a thermometer? At the beginning, I did,
*  yeah. But now it's by feel. So it's just how it gives when you touch it? Yeah. There's things
*  you can learn by touching. Like that's medium rare here. So if you use your pinky, your ring finger,
*  like this. So this, this, this, this. So this is rare. This is mid rare. This is medium. And that's
*  well. So this is what we're doing for people just listening, squeezing different parts of your hand
*  where it's more firm. Yeah. Right between the thumb and the index finger. What do you do if someone
*  asks for a well done steak? Do you tell them to go fuck themselves? Probably should, huh? No, listen.
*  If that's what they want out of the experience. Listen, sometimes people just want to yell at you
*  and that's what they want out of the experience at the restaurant. So you got to give it to them.
*  That's part of hospitality. They want to take it. They want to complain. They want some people are
*  just incorrigible. Yeah. And you just have to say, I hear you. Thank you so much for your feedback.
*  Oh, do you really? I mean, internally, I'm fucking screaming, right? Like, can I, I love Cacio e Pepe,
*  but I hate black pepper. Say what? Like black pepper, pasta, Pecorino Romano. That's those are
*  the three ingredients in it. The pasta is a vessel for the black pepper. Yeah. How could you say that?
*  Yeah. People do all the time. All the time. And they have to talk. You have to talk to these people.
*  They say, I'd like to speak to the chef. Oh no, I have people to buff, buffer me from that. Oh God,
*  I can only imagine. But still in hospitality. I mean, you know, you know, we train our, our team to
*  just like not make anything about you. And you know, you just look at someone and say,
*  maybe their mother died today. And if you just, it's so easy to diffuse. And it's really a lot of
*  psychology being applied to people where, you know, you people need to be heard and understood.
*  And so you just let people vent and you know, there's ways to kind of mimic, mimic people's,
*  you know, bodily movements and stuff to show that you've heard them. And so it's just really
*  powerful to diffuse that. And so in hospitality, you can't take anything personally. It's never
*  about you. Nothing's ever about you. I could only imagine. I used to honestly, like when I first
*  started cooking professionally as a chef, I used to read like the, the Yelp reviews and whatnot.
*  Oh no. I haven't read, I haven't read a Yelp review since 2006. Joe's a big fan of reading
*  all comments. Yeah. Super important. Hear everybody. When you, when you like, I don't have kids,
*  but so these restaurants, and I feel like I do have a lot of kids that work for me,
*  but my restaurants feel like my babies. And then in the early days I would read reviews and it
*  would be like somebody saying, your baby's ugly, so ugly. And you'd be like crushing. No, yeah.
*  It's crushing. So you can't read. Especially for chefs, like chefs put their heart and soul
*  onto the plate. You know, everything that I have inside of me goes under that plate. My history,
*  my family, my heart, my soul, my emotion. Cooking is emotion. If you, if you don't have emotion when
*  you cook, then you're not doing it right. Yeah. And when you put it out there on the public stage
*  and people says, this isn't, this sucks. Fuck you. This sucks. This isn't authentic, blah, blah, blah.
*  Cooking food is so personal to the person who's receiving it. And like we said, authenticity is
*  very personal. So sometimes I just have to say, you know what? Felix is just not the restaurant
*  for you, my friend. And we fired customers before. So you don't let them come back? Yeah. Do you have
*  a photo of them? Like a band list? Or I think it's just, you know, I think if you're in the business
*  of pleasing everybody, you please nobody. Yeah. And sometimes you just, you know, this is how it is
*  and we're not going to change it. If somebody asks for the cacio e pepe with less pepper,
*  this is not the cacio, this is not the place where you should be having cacio e pepe.
*  Sometimes we just also do that to respect the art of Evan's cooking. Yeah. Well, I think it's,
*  what I was saying earlier is that it took me watching Bourdain's love for cuisine to understand
*  what, what food really is, what being a chef really is. I miss that fucking guy. I miss that
*  fucking guy too. But, but I think many people don't ever have that experience where they do
*  make that switch in their head. Like, oh, this is art. This isn't just food, you know, and this,
*  I think there's a lot of people that it's like everything else. If you don't do it, you don't
*  really have an appreciation for it. If you don't study it or really deeply try to understand it,
*  you don't have an appreciation for it. That's like everything else. Like, like how kids treat
*  society in general, how a lot of people just take things for granted. I think people take food for
*  granted. But I think there's been a lot of focus on food over the last, you know, maybe call it
*  10 years where you have the, the chef's table and people really appreciating the art of cooking.
*  When I started cooking, that shit was a blue collar job, man. Yeah. There were very, very few
*  celebrity chefs. Like there was like Emeril and Mario when I started cooking and like
*  overnight it became like the hot shit to do. And all these culinary schools start opening and just
*  meat grinder just churning out these ill-prepared entitled kids. And you know, they sell them a bill
*  of goods when, when they go to culinary school. You're like, you graduate from here, you're going
*  to be a chef. What I didn't know, as soon as I got out of culinary school, I was making $7 a fucking
*  hour, $7 an hour, you know, peeling fucking carrots and potatoes and picking parsley and shit.
*  And like, you really kind of love it to get to that point. And you got to do it for 10 years to get
*  good at it. And then you got to do it another 10 years to start making money from it. And that's it.
*  And a lot of the younger kids, they're just not willing to pay the fucking cost. And they want to
*  skip rungs in the ladder. And that's the case with every art form. We find that with comedy,
*  with standup comedy, there's a lot of kids that they, they want to do standup and they develop a
*  YouTube channel and then they get a following for making funny YouTube videos. And then they
*  think they're a standup comic and you're like, hold the fuck on. They're like, where's my Netflix
*  special? Like exactly. I demand it. Yeah, it takes with comedy and food. The proof is in the end
*  result, it's either good or it's bad. You, you might be able to make one dish perfectly one time,
*  but can you do that shit 10,000 times with 98% accuracy? Right. That's where that's the rub.
*  There's also a thing in, I think in being a chef where what you were talking about making $7 an
*  hour peeling onions and stuff that that's real similar to comedy in that you got to do the road.
*  You don't, you got to work these shit holes and you might hate it while you're doing it,
*  but one day you look back and go, Oh, that was really important for my development.
*  It's, it's pure and simple as foundation. Yeah. Just you can't build anything without a strong
*  foundation. Now when you create your menu, how often do you change it?
*  Um, at Felix, I think we, we cook specifically with seasonality. So if the market changes,
*  we change. And that's really how the Italians have cooked for thousands and thousands of years.
*  You know, seasonality is a real buzzword in the U S but the Italian has been cooking that way out
*  of necessity for thousands of years. And so many other cultures, but I really take, you know,
*  my inspiration from tradition and try to pay homage to those culinary traditions in Italy.
*  And I try to put as a minimal amount of ego and a minimal amount of manipulation towards the
*  traditional product. And all I want to do is present whatever it is, whether it's cacio e pepe or
*  tagliatelle Bolognese, the truest form that you can possibly get in the U S that's what I want to
*  put forth. And if you take my Bolognese, the inspiration from that, do you have the bolo
*  at Felix? I'm sure I've had it. Yeah. That should taste like the streets of Bologna,
*  the diesel fuel, cigarette smoke, the melting pork fat like that. Italy, Italian food is so,
*  Italian food is so, is so environmentally driven. Italian food is so environmentally driven. And
*  it's hard to accomplish that if you're in the ass end of Culver City. So you have to coax out
*  these nuances from products that are born in the place that you're trying to evoke,
*  you know, like prosciutto di parma, mortadella di bologna. So like it needs to taste of that place.
*  If you're sitting on the island of Capri and you're eating a caprese salad, drinking a glass wine
*  with the person that you love and the ocean breeze is on your face, and then you eat a caprese salad
*  at Joe Schmo's place and fucking Inglewood, it doesn't read the same way. And that's really
*  where the difference between good restaurants, bad restaurants and great restaurants really lives.
*  And what about the wine? Like how do you know what wine to buy that's going to go with the
*  meals that you're serving? Again, it goes down to regionality and someone who has a great palate.
*  You know, our wine director, Matt Rogel has done an exceptional job at choosing wines that are
*  specific to the regions that we're inspired by. And you got to taste it. And that's what I mean,
*  that's the fun part. But like, you just have to taste everything, taste it. And there's a lot of
*  shit wine out there, but there's a lot of exceptional wine that is made by very small family farms that
*  that are sorry, vintners, that this the allocation is so small that they barely have enough to send
*  to the US. So does the wine director look at your menu and then say, you know, this is going to
*  require 100% it's totally it has to be collaborative. You know, so you'll show him the menu and then you
*  have a dialogue about like what kind of wine exactly and then do you try it? Do you like make
*  a dish and try the wine with that dish and will taste multiple wines, multiple wines, what could
*  possibly go with whatever you're making? What if it if it's a new dish or a new wine or it's the same
*  menu and an old wine, a different vintage, a different area of the region where the wine is grown,
*  like there's so many different elements to to choosing wine. And then on top of it,
*  training the staff to make suggestions to clientele, like, hey, what do you really like?
*  That gets back to that conversation between us and the clientele and knowing more about
*  our clientele and who likes to come to Felix gives us better, you know, a better standpoint.
*  How many people do you think are return customers? I would say at least 75 to 80%.
*  Wow. Absolutely. That's crazy. You recognize people? Of course. Wow. I mean, you saw me,
*  I stand at the pasta. I'm in the dining room. Yeah. And I check every single plate coming out
*  of the kitchen. Wow. You know, your bread and butter is really your returning customers in any
*  restaurant. You're going to have an element of people that come in because they're traveling
*  from other parts of the world and they want to check out your restaurant. But, you know, imagine
*  right now we're traveling is really hit. So if you don't have your local customer base built up,
*  then you're in trouble. Now, for someone like you that has so many restaurants and you have so many
*  plates spinning, how do you not go crazy? Like how do you, how do you manage all that? I can't
*  imagine the stress that's on your head. The weight that you're carrying on your shoulders running that
*  many restaurants. Well, I have an amazing team. So it's not, I'm definitely not alone in this. And I
*  have amazing people and we're in this together. And I think I had a moment where I was brought
*  to my knees. I felt stressed like I had never felt before. I was thinking that could I have an
*  aneurysm right now. I was just feeling uncontrollable stress, you know, with the thought of just losing
*  everything that I had built up and my personality being so conservative. I just couldn't, I couldn't
*  believe it was overwhelming. And then I gave myself, I just gave myself a few days to be that way and
*  have, you know, that, that reaction. And, you know, I'm an entrepreneur and I'm gritty and I just gave
*  myself essentially a few days and then I picked myself up and I said, well, what are we going to
*  do? And I'm not alone in this. Everybody in my industry, the industry has been decimated. And to
*  know that we're in this together and to look at solutions where you have to adapt and innovate and
*  renegotiate. So, you know, how are we going to create these other new revenue streams? And so I
*  got back into working mode, working around the clock with my team and a lot of my restaurants
*  in Toronto, you can buy all of your groceries and essentials and just looking for other revenue
*  streams to survive. Have any of them opened up in Toronto yet? Not for a sit down and we're behind
*  the U.S. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Why is that? Well, because the, the, the virus lagged in, you know,
*  in the spread. It started here, started spreading in New York City before Toronto. So we were just,
*  I think about three weeks behind everything happening here. So, and I think we're a little
*  bit more conservative with reopening. And we like, you know, it's all, everyone's telling me they
*  can't get the, even the antibody test anywhere in Canada. So we're, we're behind on these kind of
*  things. So we don't know when we're going to be allowed to be open for seated, to be seated.
*  You know, and I think the one good news, we're going into summer, a lot of my restaurants have
*  a lot of patio space and we know that you're safer outdoors for obvious reasons. And in,
*  with Felix, we went to the landlord to ask if we could use the back area space. There's like a
*  little park at, so we're going to use outdoor space behind the restaurants. And it's all about
*  making people feel safe. People will come out if they feel safe. There's going to be your young
*  customer base that doesn't care, but as more and more restaurants open, there's just going to,
*  it's going to be spread amongst fewer restaurants. So we're not out of the woods here. We're not going
*  to be, you know, and again, our goal is to survive this.
*  Now, do you look at these new restaurants you're about to open? Do you put them on pause?
*  Do you just continue ahead once you get the green light and just say, let's make it happen?
*  Well, each project again is, you know, is very different and I have different amounts of money
*  invested in each project. So what we're doing is negotiating around the clock with, for example,
*  if we have landlords in certain places, we're renegotiating the leases right now, and we're
*  asking to put it on pause, put the entire project on pause till we come out of this
*  and I can start building the company again and have some revenue to put back into the projects.
*  So some landlords have been unwilling in the beginning, but now they're more willing as they
*  realize who can take my place. If somebody who I've got a very strong record, I've never closed a
*  restaurant and- That's amazing. That's really amazing.
*  Thank you. Isn't it like-
*  It's pretty amazing. Yeah, it's amazing. What is the average restaurant? Like what percentage?
*  80%. 80% close.
*  Failure. Yeah.
*  Yeah. High failure rate. Very tough business. Don't go in it.
*  Nobody. Nobody. It's such a hard business. Nah, I love it. I love it. It's passion for us until
*  we do it. But landlords, maybe initially were saying, just you got to pay your rent. Even on
*  construction sites, my rent was kicking in. I'm like, ah, I'm not even open and I got to pay rent.
*  I can't do that, so take the keys. And so some of them were like, why would you want to waste
*  your investment? And I'd be like, I'm like in triage and I got to save the restaurants that are
*  open. I can't be like building a worse time to be building a restaurant. So I had to be willing to
*  walk away. And in negotiations, your strongest position is being willing to walk away. So I'm
*  like, just take the keys. I can't even be concerned about this. Even if I've got millions of dollars
*  out on construction sites, I'm like, take the keys. And then they come back and they say,
*  well, I guess we don't have anyone else to come in our place when restaurants have been decimated.
*  Retail, like are you going to get Neiman Marcus in there? J. Crew? Who's coming in my place?
*  So once they start to realize that, they're saying, okay, let's sit down at the negotiation
*  table and work this out. So I'm working through every project. So I don't have the answers right
*  now, but I'm willing to walk away if I can't negotiate to be something that I can actually
*  survive in the end and not just pour more money into something that I'll just lose my shirt.
*  I want to pause on the construction sites. It seems like there's going to be a long
*  period of time before anybody considers opening up a new restaurant. Oh my God. Well, who would
*  be surprised? You think so? People are going to just jump in some gangsters. The thing is this is
*  it. There is no restaurant life without restaurant death. And this is a revolving door. Dude,
*  you just got philosophical as fuck right there. It's just, it's the way of this game. And it's
*  the unfortunate fact that from extraordinary, these extraordinary circumstances, there's going
*  to be a lot of leases that are available. And there are a lot of people who want to open
*  restaurants because it's the hot thing to do. I 100% agree. I just think that there's going to be
*  a lot of young people coming now because commercial real estate is going to be very affordable and
*  they can come in. So I think a little bit, there's going to be a changing of the guard.
*  Well, restaurants in LA have very unique personalities too. There's like celebrity
*  spots, which I'm always like super wary of. And they always seem really gross,
*  like I've eaten at Catch before and there's like paparazzi waiting for you as you're walking in.
*  You're like, what is? Those places are done by design. They're flashy and whatever, but
*  we've always tried to create a safe haven, like a sanctuary for the celebrity clientele. If you need
*  to go out the back door and because there's paparazzi outside, absolutely, let's go through
*  the kitchen, whatever you need. And I think that's a lot of the reason why celebrities are attracted
*  to Felix is that I'm just here to feed you and make sure you have a good time. And then if you
*  need anything further on top of that, we're willing to supply that, whatever it is. And on top of that,
*  the food's pretty good. But yeah, the food's amazing, but it's like scenes, those are weird.
*  Those are engineered. They're engineered. So they probably tell the paparazzi, come hang out here.
*  They probably have some sort of a weird deal with celebrities. Bring your celebrity friends.
*  And celebrities do go there to be photographed. And it happens all over the place. But this is LA.
*  Yeah. I was listening to these dummies talk and they were like, we went to Catch,
*  there was no one famous there. They went there just to see famous people.
*  What's the thing? It's bizarre.
*  It's fucking weird. It's fucking weird. Yeah. When you look at all the restaurants,
*  and LA is a really good place for restaurants. Would you agree with that?
*  I think LA is the best place to cook right now. Really?
*  In all of the United States. Absolutely. Why so?
*  Just because, you know, for a very long time, LA wasn't really respected as a bonafide place
*  for people to cook. Why was that? Just no respect. Just no respect.
*  And it was always San Francisco. It was always New York.
*  And they pulled the Michelin Guide out of LA. The Michelin Guide existed here and then they pulled
*  it out and they just brought it back last year. Why? Why did they pull it out?
*  They didn't think it was good enough. Because they don't take it seriously.
*  What? Really? For real.
*  Because we just have a different style and approach to dining. Fine dining has its place in Los
*  Angeles, but there's literally a handful of fine dining restaurants. And that's what Michelin is
*  really geared towards rating is fine dining restaurants. You have to do certain things,
*  certain criteria that you have to hit to get a Michelin star. That's all there is. And they
*  focus a lot on French and Japanese style restaurants. Which is big in New York. It's big in San
*  Francisco. It's big in Chicago. So they focus on that. So they pulled it, I think it was 2009,
*  they pulled the guide. Wow. They just didn't take it seriously.
*  Not good enough LA. But they came back last year. Yeah, it was a lot of backlash when they came back.
*  Okay, we think you're good enough now. And a lot of people in LA were like,
*  this is not going to hold water. How does one get a Michelin star? Like, how does that work?
*  They come down and they just decide. The tire company sends people out.
*  How weird is that too? These people go out and eat.
*  It's a French tire company. Is it?
*  Yeah. Michelin's from France?
*  But it's a strange thing that a tire company is the most respected.
*  Yeah. They send inspectors, they're supposed to be anonymous. There's certain criteria that they
*  also dine. It's always a two top. They always do special requests. What's a two top?
*  Two tops, two people. Okay. Or a deuce.
*  You're talking restaurant talk here. And they ask for birthday candles,
*  they ask for special adjustments to their meal. They always order a bottle of wine or two glasses.
*  It's just there's a lot of hidden kind of things that they do that give you the heads up that
*  they're there. In my opinion, I don't think Michelin actually came to Felix. And that's why
*  we were left off because they couldn't get a reservation. Really?
*  Yeah, man. We're booked out 28 days in advance at Felix. And for every day of that month,
*  we have over 500 people on the wait list for that day.
*  So does it matter if you're on a Michelin star? Does that mean anything to you?
*  No. I don't do it for them. I don't do it for Accolades. I do it for the people who show up
*  to cook there and work there for my team. And we do it for the people who come to eat.
*  Well, just as a client or a customer, if you're not on that list, that list is bullshit.
*  It really is. You said it, Joe.
*  That list is bullshit. Like if you're telling me the best restaurants in LA is and your
*  restaurant's not on it, nonsense. You have a nonsense list. Like you better get a reservation,
*  son. I just think the criteria is a little bit archaic. Yeah.
*  It's a little bit archaic. And they had an exceptional chance to really create some,
*  um, you know, some support for the list in Los Angeles. And they really created animosity
*  through like throughout the city. Is there any other established
*  methods of judging restaurants? Everyone who sits down. Right. It's immediate.
*  Word of mouth. Word of mouth. The real.
*  Yeah. And that's, I just say scoreboard, man. Scoreboard. I'm busy every night. I crank every
*  night. Your best work is within your four walls and people walking out and word of mouth. Right.
*  Do you, do you like, you know, we're not going to take out advertisements to say come to Felix.
*  You're going to have a great plate of pasta. It's going to be your friends telling you how
*  did you come to Felix the first time? Callum.
*  Well, he looks at me. Listen to me. Listen to me. The best, the best restaurant on earth.
*  Felix in Venice. It's on Abbot Kenny. You're going with me. The best restaurant. Trust me.
*  Like really the best, the best. This is Brian, the best. I'm like, okay. Like Brian is a real foodie.
*  When Callum tells me something's amazing. I saw him the other day picking up to go.
*  Yeah. When he says the best, I'm like, really? Okay. Like he literally calls me. You must,
*  you must eat there. You must. It's the best. He's right. Favorite. That's the best. That's the best.
*  That's the best compliment. It's the best compliment. People show up every day.
*  And that's all that, you know, that's all that I need. Yeah. It's like Kevin Costner and feel the
*  dreams. Build it and they will come. They will come. Yeah. I mean, it's, it is a beautiful thing
*  when things get out purely by word of mouth, you know, it has more staying power that way.
*  Sure. I mean, we, we, um, just after we opened, we had, um, an incredible accolade in Esquire
*  magazine, which named us the number one new restaurant in America. That helps.
*  That helps. That's the restaurant in America, Esquire. Wow. See? Esquire knows what the fuck
*  they're talking about. Fuck you, Michelin. Yeah. Certain accolades like that. Um, you know,
*  that's why we have it. You know, people will say about Felix. The complaint is they can't get in
*  because we had, we've had certain accolades. So anyone traveling to LA, they're like Esquire
*  magazine, number one new restaurant. They want to, they want to check out Felix. So. Have you
*  guys thought about making a larger version of Felix or do you like the fact that it's all
*  manageable? It's small. It's exclusive. You know, I like to keep my eye on everything
*  and that restaurants just big enough, uh, that we can be busy. We can employ a good amount of staff
*  members and we can serve a significant amount of people per night. And anything over that is just,
*  you know, I think it loses some of the specialness of the restaurant. You know, that restaurant is,
*  it's a jewel. It's a total jewel. And there's an adage in business. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
*  You can open another restaurant, do something else, but there's only, there's only one Felix
*  on a bikini and that's how it's going to stay. Now, when you create a dish, say if you,
*  is this something like, if whether it's a pasta dish or anything, is it something that you've
*  already cooked before or do you experiment? Do you create things based on like what you already know
*  about food and you have an idea? Um, that's a good question. I mean, honestly, I try not to create.
*  Obviously I'm putting my, my own, not a spin, but my own fingerprint on it, but I'm really just
*  drawing from thousands of years of tradition and just trying not to fuck it up and pay homage to
*  the people who created it. And anything on the Felix, uh, on the Felix menu, I've learned from
*  someone in Italy. Like I don't make pasta shapes that I saw on YouTube because for me that's cheap.
*  It's cheap. There's more value to me to learn it from a grandmother in Italy, in their region,
*  in their house and pass that knowledge on to me so that I can authentically present it in the,
*  in the best way possible. So when you were learning and you were, you were in Italy doing this,
*  did you have this understanding that all this would eventually play out like that and that you
*  would become a great chef and that this is the idea that you're, you're putting in the work?
*  Or were you just enamored by the passion of making it? I absolutely fell in love with
*  the Italian approach to cooking, the Italian approach to living, their, their reverence for
*  land and tradition. And when I got, you know, I classically trained French, you know, French food.
*  I went to the Le Cordon Bleu, whatever. I cooked for seven years, French and, and, uh, Asian
*  techniques at Spago in Beverly Hills. And as soon as I went to Italy, all of that went out the window
*  and I adopted this approach because I just absolutely fell in love with the country.
*  And I've, you know, that, that love, you know, it burns hot. What about that? Why,
*  why does that resonate more than say French cuisine or? Because French food manipulates,
*  they manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, you know, sous vide and, and turning, you know,
*  a tomato into something else to look like something else or tastes like something else. I just don't,
*  I don't get that. So much goes into growing something that's already naturally perfect.
*  Why wouldn't you just slice it open, put some sea salt on it and drizzle it with fine olive oil
*  and eat it? Like that's fucking perfect. Why would you want to fucking puree it and then put,
*  jellify it and put it into it? You know, like why? I just don't get it. So, um, I just left it all
*  behind. All those manipulative techniques that are very, very popular in a lot of,
*  a lot of the world, a lot of the restaurants in the world. I just, it doesn't excite me.
*  That's just personal preference. Personal. Because some people love French cuisine.
*  They love all the weird little details. That's like, how many times could you go to
*  a buoy? You know, how many times can you go? We always, uh, um, friend, Audrey has now closed
*  restaurant and essentially the godfather of molecular gastronomy. And, um, you know,
*  how many times can you go there and, and have the experience and say, fuck, I want to go back to
*  that place because this was so good. It hits you in a different way. When you make food that people
*  crave on a daily basis, it just hits different. It gets inside of you. You will never forget that
*  steak that you had at Felix. Never. And once it's in there, once it's in your mind, you're like,
*  fuck, I'm going to have that again. And that's really my goal as a pasta maker, as a chef is to
*  create dishes that hit different, you know, and, and, and to ultimately like evoke memory.
*  Do you have the Cacio e Pepe at Felix? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So my goal is like, if you have the Cacio
*  e Pepe at Felix and you've been to Rome and eaten Cacio e Pepe, I want you to be like, fuck,
*  this is better than Rome or remember that time we were in Rome, we had Cacio e Pepe. This is
*  better or this is worse or whatever. You evoke memories and you make them. And that's really
*  the ultimate goal is, is to get inside people's heads so that they come back. It's a weird thing,
*  food. It's the mouth pleasure is a very strange thing. Like the flavors, like you're, you're playing
*  games with the inside of people's mouths, you know, that's a fucked up way to say it, but it's
*  really what it is. When those flavors come together, you like, you savor the bite. You're like,
*  like, and for that brief moment, while it's in your mouth and you're chewing it, you get this really
*  amazing pleasure. It's also, it's also a drug and a lot of chemicals changing your chemical.
*  There's nothing like it in the world. No, it's so important. And God, I appreciate it so much. I
*  appreciate going out to a restaurant so much because of this pandemic and I'm, I always
*  appreciated it. It was always a wonderful treat to be able to go to a nice restaurant, but God,
*  I appreciate it so much now when you don't have it. And I like cooking. I cook all the time. I
*  enjoy it, but there's something about not having it that makes you go, Oh, I'm going to appreciate
*  this so much when you get to do it again. Yeah, that's great. Well, that, that gives us hope.
*  Yeah. So from here, it's just, uh, waiting out the protests and then putting it all together again
*  with the staff. And do you bring this, is everybody available? Did you, are you going to be able to
*  have the same crew? Some are, some are not. Some are not comfortable coming back, but they're not
*  ready. And that's because of the disease. Yeah. Are they getting unemployment? Uh, I think
*  a lot of them are. Yeah. I mean, the cares act really up to the, um, unemployment, you know,
*  when you're making 600 net a week and your, you know, decision is, do I keep taking this money
*  or do I put my life at risk? And it's going to be a certain percentage that they don't want to
*  come back to work. I don't blame them. Yeah. I know what you're saying. I wish there was more
*  emphasis by the government put on having you use, take strategies to strengthen your immune system
*  and explain to people how important it is. Stop eating so much sugar, stop drinking so much,
*  get some exercise. All these things have a real measurable effect on your immune system, but yet
*  it's all fear. It's all cover your face, wear a shield, don't touch this hand sanitizer. It's
*  like there's weakening the immune system. Exactly. It's well, I don't know if your immune system gets
*  weakened because of non-contact or it gets strengthened because of contact. If it really
*  does get weakened because of non-contact, you're dealing with a bunch of people with severely
*  compromised immune systems going out, marching together, stacking on top of each other.
*  We, you know, it's a really kind of a crazy experiment to see where COVID is right now
*  because of these, uh, these marches. That's for sure. Yeah, that's for sure.
*  So you guys optimistic? Yeah, always, always, always a hundred percent optimistic assault forward,
*  assault, assault forward. We have to move forward. We have to go. Yeah. We have, we don't have a
*  choice. We must move forward. If we don't, we die. Once you stop moving, you die. And that's it. It's
*  like, we just have to push and you have to be working at it. And like, you know, there's a lot
*  of restaurants that are closing and a lot of great restaurants that are closing to no fault of their
*  own, because, you know, again, for so many reasons, right? If you're a little bit weak, if you're a new
*  restaurant, you're going to have a hard time. If you're an old restaurant and your sales are kind
*  of weak, you're going to close. But right now, if you sit down and just kind of wait it out and,
*  you're going to die. But if you, you know, Felix in 48 hours became a takeout and delivery restaurant,
*  there was no takeout and delivery because pasta. We didn't even have containers, dude.
*  But in 48 hours, you know, here are your pasta kits and you can have a perfect experience at home.
*  You know, just boil your water in three minutes, you have a Felix dinner, but that was created by
*  the team at Felix in 48 hours. A lot of restaurants, they just like they're sitting around and they're
*  not, you know, they're not being proactive. And it's also about renegotiating with the banks and
*  renegotiating with your landlords and looking for new revenue streams. So you have to be doing,
*  you have to be doing all of that work right now or you will not survive. I thought it was remarkably
*  flexible that a lot of restaurants were putting together these kits that that became a thing.
*  It's really very interesting. They just adapted and said, okay, how can we give these people
*  instructions and then put together this food and then what we did, we, we, we created the, the kits
*  specifically geared towards shelter at home so that you could get restaurant quality pasta
*  and just literally boil water and you're there. So you continue to make the pasta basically the
*  same way and then do you send it to them with like very specific instructions? Absolutely.
*  Put salt in the water, do this. The whole bit. Yeah. The whole bit is basically heat up the sauce,
*  boil the water, add this amount of salt, boil it for three minutes, add it to the sauce, boom,
*  add the cheese. You're good to go. It's been, it's been successful. And I think a lot of restaurants
*  took, took, you know, notes from us and started doing the same thing because it,
*  it's really kept us alive and obviously people fucking love pizza. Yeah. And I think, you know,
*  one upside to this is we, we weren't necessarily known for how good the pizza is at Felix, but now
*  people fucking know how good the fucking pizza is at Felix. You guys make good everything, man.
*  But like, so if someone orders a steak, are you cooking steak or are you sending them steak to
*  cook? We're sending them prepackaged Krav-Ak steaks with instructions that, you know, everybody likes
*  their steak cooked differently. So we give general guidelines and pro tips of how to rest and,
*  you know, we send them salsa verde and we send them, you know, steak salt and whatnot. So. Are
*  you telling them to cook on a frying pan? Like how are you, how are you getting them to cook it?
*  High heat, either the grill or in the frying pan. Just high heat is your thing. High heat, man. High
*  heat and then just intervals. High heat, take it off, let it rest. High heat, take it off. So you
*  cook more, especially the T-bones. So when you do that, so you're, you're not doing it in one shot.
*  You're, you're kicking it a little bit and then letting it rest. I'll take up to an hour to cook
*  like a 35 ounce T-bone. Really? Absolutely. Wow. You bring up the temperature very slow and gradual.
*  You're doing it with high heat in these. Why high heat?
*  Cause you, yeah, that's all you got in restaurants. High heat, low and slow is typically for braising,
*  but if you're dealing with dry heat, it should be violent. It should be quick and then let it rest,
*  especially the T-bone. You got to start the T-bone on the actual bone, right? So vertical
*  started on your trigger. Yeah. That's how you do it. You start on the bone so that the heat can
*  radiate gently through the bone and out towards the meat. So if you just throw the T-bone on
*  side and then sign it, you have a part that's connected to that actual T-bone, the separation
*  bone. It's going to be raw and everything else is going to be medium medium rare. But if you
*  started on the bone, the heat is gently radiated through the meat. So halfway through, we take the
*  filet mignon off and cook the New York side a little longer. So how long do you make it sit on
*  the bone? How long do you have it stacked vertically like that? Like 10 to 12 minutes.
*  Oh, wow. I never even thought of that. Yeah, man. Bistecca Fiorentina. The master is Dario.
*  Who's that? Dario Chikini. He's like the most famous, you should look him up. He's one of the
*  most famous butchers in all of Italy. He quotes Dante. He's a fucking maniac. But I went to his
*  restaurant I think two years ago. Is that in Florence? It's in, I want to say, I can't remember.
*  Yeah. Oh, there he is. What's good, Dario? Look at him. Yeah. Amazing. Look at that face. Amazing.
*  So happy. Well, yeah, he's a wild man. He's a wild man. But he starts the T-bone on the bone.
*  So he's, oh, Jesus Christ. He's a maestro. He's the size of that fucking steak. Absolute master.
*  That's preposterous. Absolute master. And so you learned from him? I did not learn from him.
*  We've been cooking. I've been cooking for 20 years. So you pick things up along the way. Cooking's
*  just like, it's like a practice. You got a doctor, you got a lawyer. You learn the fundamentals.
*  And then throughout your career, you upgrade those fundamentals with new and relevant techniques or
*  laws or whatever. Cooking's the same thing. You get a foundation and then you upgrade new and
*  relevant techniques. And so are you using a grill that uses wood? Are you cooking on wood? Yeah,
*  we're cooking on California almond and white oak. Almond? Almond. Almond for the smoke because it'll
*  go to fire like that because it's so saturated with almond oil and then oak for long and slow
*  cooking. So it's burned super hot. So the almond burns really quick and the oak burns very slow.
*  And so you put different woods in for different times? Yeah. So you started off with the almond?
*  We start with almond and then we add oak and then we add almond and then we add oak and it's just
*  kind of fire maintenance is 90% of wood fire cooking. So it's just about how hot it burns
*  in the distance, how high the coals are. And how deep the coal bed is and how evenly dispersed the
*  heat is. We'll have a cool side and a hot side and then a fire side all within like two square feet.
*  Is there images of your grill set up online? No. I don't think so. Evan, your 10% technique right now
*  is not sounding like 10% of your cooking. That sounds a lot, right? Yeah. I'm like hold on a second.
*  How could that be 10%? You're rotating the food. It's a fatty 10%. So did you set up this grill this
*  way because like you that's the only way you cook steak? You prefer to cook it over wood or?
*  The design of Felix, the actual shoe box of the kitchen that we have is really,
*  you know, the design was based on the restrictions of the size. So we've crammed a hell of a lot into
*  I think it's just under 220 square feet, something like that. There's a pizza oven in there as a
*  wood fire grill. There's 10 burners as a fryer. And you cook it 500 meals a night in that?
*  I think top end is like 350, 350 people. So if you times that by three or four different
*  different plates per person. Wow, we're so more than that. It's built for speed. I build restaurants
*  for speed. And I know some restaurants they have those crazy like it's like a gas broiler. Yeah,
*  you know, and then some of them have tastes like gasoline. Does it? I can't stand. It's like a
*  Boston broiler. Top and bottom. What's a Boston broiler? It's like you it's like a drawer you pull
*  it out and steak on a lot of like Mastro's and and old school steak houses have them because it
*  cooks with crazy intense heat from right and bottom at the same time. Yeah, but you don't know
*  don't like it. Not the way to do it. Yeah, it's analog. I like to do as many things analog as
*  possible. I still write with pencil. Really? Yeah, but it's interesting because all this attention
*  to detail all the like, it's kind of shock. Not honestly shocking, but surprisingly, like, Oh,
*  okay. Wow, almond and then okay. But it makes sense. If you eat there, you go, okay, this someone
*  has to put an insane amount of attention to detail to make dishes that are that satisfying.
*  Well, the simplicity kind of belies the the background of the dish, you know, it looks really
*  fucking simple. But there's 20 years of experience behind it. And that's that's that's like the ultimate
*  goal should look simple. It should be delicious. But, you know, do you necessarily need to know
*  about the wizard behind the the curtain? No, I do want to know. But it's also Evan procures
*  absolutely the best product from everywhere and has the best relationships with the best farmers.
*  And he's like, when you go to the farmers market with Evan, he's like, he's like the king of the
*  farmers market, the mayor, or the mayor of the farmers market. And they're like, we've we've
*  saved you these little heads. Everything is handpicked. I go Wednesdays and Saturdays,
*  not recently, obviously, but everything is handpicked. We don't do pre orders, I go there.
*  And that's, that's the very basis of cooking Italian, you go to the market,
*  your ingredients from the farmers market, I would say 90 to 92% of all the vegetables that we use,
*  local farms, not nothing outside of 500 miles. So you have these long standing relationships
*  with these farms. And do you talk to them in advance? And they say, Okay, we've got great,
*  we talk about whether we talk about soil content, we talk about water content, we talk about if it's
*  going to rain, what's coming up? What do you have in the ground? What are you planning for three
*  months from now? I've smuggled seeds back from Italy so that they can like plant stuff that
*  you had to smuggle. Yeah, man. Don't tell me. People are listening. So some things are allowed.
*  But like I've brought certain species of, you know, bitter greens and different types of peppers.
*  No, I give them the farmers equally to different, like micro climates, because California is great,
*  right? They have a ton of microclimates. So say, for instance, we buy broccoli, sprouting broccoli,
*  I'll buy broccoli from three different farms and three different micro climates with three different
*  soil contents. Right? So I'll buy broccoli from conk thou in Fresno, and then I'll buy broccoli
*  from James Birch in Floribella, which is three rivers. And then I'll buy broccoli from Romeo
*  Coleman. And all three of them have different soil contents. So James, all of James's water in three
*  rivers comes from melting snow caps. So it has a huge amount of mineral content in the soil.
*  And then you buy Kong's broccoli in Fresno, super hot with cold nights, complex sugar. So it's very
*  sweet. And then you buy Romeo's broccoli, which is less than, I think, a mile and a half from the
*  ocean, high salinity content in the broccoli, you mix all the broccolis together and it's like
*  broccoli on fucking steroids. Could you tell if I gave you a piece of broccoli from each place where
*  it came from? I'm not that crazy. Like a sommelier, like sommeliers can tell you, they can sip wine
*  and a really good one can tell you where it's coming from. It's a little easier to do with wine.
*  Is it really? Yeah, I think so. So you can't, but you know there is a difference. If you
*  taste it, you can tell. It's terroir. It's terroir just like wine has terroir. Terroir,
*  it means the territory, the ground, what's in the ground. The terroir is specific to where that
*  thing is grown. And terroir exists not only in wine, but in fruits and vegetables. All of it.
*  And is the same approach to meat? Like what kind of? 100%. If you're raising steers in Colorado
*  versus Utah versus California, California has very, very little grass and all the grass that's
*  down tastes like dry ass fucking grass because there's no water. So the beef tastes of that place.
*  And if you're finishing cattle on corn or feeding it 100% corn, it's going to taste completely
*  different. The marbling is going to be completely different. The steaks I brought you today are 80-20.
*  So 80% of the of the steers life is grass and then they're finished on corn because America's
*  literally in love with corn fed flavor and that mouth feel from the fat. So it's 80-20.
*  But corn makes cattle sick. That's why they pump them full of antibiotics. So
*  the good ranchers who practice animal husbandry, they do it in a way that doesn't make the animal
*  sick. So they're just doing it in the last stages of their life. Correct. Is that what you prefer?
*  Have you tried different kind like all 100% grass fed grass finished?
*  There are certain cuts of the of the steer that benefit from grass fed beef or just 100% grass
*  diet. Typically shanks working muscles because working muscles have way more flavor than non
*  working muscles like filet mignon. Filet mignon doesn't taste like fucking anything to me,
*  because it's a non working muscle versus a shank is working all the time. That's why it's tough.
*  So if I was to eat you Joe Rogan, if I was to break you down like an animal, I would choose
*  the working muscles and then braise them because they're stronger versus your filet mignon. I don't
*  even know where the fuck that would be on a human, but it would taste different and it would have a
*  different texture. Cattle is the same way. Non working muscles versus working muscles.
*  Have you ever gotten ahold of any wild boar? 100%. Wild boar is huge in Italy. Do you do
*  you cook it? It's a hard sell on avakini. Is it really? Yeah. So some people don't enjoy the
*  nuances. People would call it gamey, but I don't find it gamey. If you treat it and apply certain,
*  if you apply certain herbs and certain, I wouldn't call them spices, but apply certain ingredients
*  to it, it takes the gameyness all the way. So for me, if I cook wild boar, I think Tuscany. I think
*  of Abruzzo. I think of wild country. And for me, the hills of Tuscany smell like wild fennel and
*  rosemary and dirt. And you want to bring out those again, back to the terroir and give those
*  types of elements to the wild boar. And it makes it sing, man. It makes it sing. I brought that up
*  because of the whole idea of the working muscles. Like this, that's a working animal. It's a tough.
*  Yeah. It's a tough animal. And most pork that's on the market, they don't really do anything.
*  Right. Yeah. They just sit around and eat. Just sit around and eat and get fat. And that's what
*  people are really looking for when it comes to pork. But wild boar ragu has been pretty
*  trendy for the last, I'd say, few years. It's a weird thing to call it boar too,
*  because boar just means a male pig. I'm sure there's a lot of female pigs in there too. It's
*  wild pigs, what they really should call it. But for whatever reason, people like the word boar.
*  It's a weird one, right? It's a weird one. Now what about game? Do you serve venison or any elk?
*  Hard sell. Hard sell on avakini. I love venison. I love elk. I've cooked it in the past. But yeah,
*  it's a hard sell. And it goes back to knowing your clientele. Just because I want to
*  put some ego into the menu doesn't mean that... You don't want anything that's a hard sell.
*  You want something that's going to be just... I want people to
*  spend money. Gravitate towards it and enjoy it. Well, it's also the menu at Felix. The entrée is
*  a secondi. It's a very small section because our kitchen is very small. So there's only going to
*  be usually about two proteins on the menu. So you don't want to... If you have a much larger menu,
*  you can be a little bit more creative or put on those cuts that aren't as popular.
*  But when your menu's that short, you have to look at sales. And also meat of any kind, whether
*  that's fish or whatever, is extremely expensive. And going back to the conversation of charging
*  an accurate amount of money for a dish, it's hard. Take a look at lamb. Lamb wholesale is like
*  fucking $18 a pound. For me, that's wholesale cost. So that means I need to charge you $65
*  for three bones of a rack of lamb. $65. That's for me to cover the cost of running my kitchen
*  out of that one dish. That's so crazy. And every single item on the menu is costed in that way.
*  We have a cost, then we have to figure out how much labor it costs to make that dish.
*  And then we have to figure out our lights and our utilities and our rent and all that other shit.
*  And then we got to put a price on it. So when you go out to eat, you're not just paying for
*  the ingredients. You do that at home. You're paying for the experience, the staff, the lights,
*  the water, all of that. I hope people take that in consideration when they eat at a fine restaurant.
*  I really do. I think people don't know, but right now people are talking about the restaurant
*  industry because we've been hit so hard. And to understand that 90% of all of our revenue goes
*  back out into the economy. So you're taking your money and you're paying your staff and you're
*  paying your rent and you're paying your food costs. So a lot of it goes right back out.
*  Most of it, the majority. 90%.
*  God, it's such a crazy business just hearing you guys talk about it. It sounds like such a balancing
*  act. And then to be hit over the head with something like this pandemic and everything
*  getting locked down. Restaurants are so valuable to me. And it's one of the things that I worried
*  most about this pandemic other than the lives was like businesses that I enjoy and then restaurants
*  specifically, because it's such a great way to spend time with someone. I mean, it's one of the
*  great pleasures of life to be able to go to a place and have a fantastic chef sit you down and
*  cook some amazing food and you enjoy it. And that if that goes away.
*  Well, you know, I think over the last few years, restaurants in general have really in North
*  America, I will say has really reached a pinnacle of cultural relevance right now. And but it has
*  to be reimagined. We're not we're not going to go back to that for the next little while. And you
*  know, there's going to be, you know, there's one restaurant in the Netherlands who has a robot.
*  Did you see that with a little robot in the robot food master in the Netherlands, a little
*  robot that comes in is the bus person cleaning cleaning the tables and also bringing your food.
*  Look it up. Robot the robot robot Netherlands restaurant. It cleans the table,
*  cleans the table brings your food. Yeah. And a reopened Dutch restaurant is using robots to
*  implement social distancing by serving and seating customers. That's fucking creepy. Look at that
*  face. Look at that face. Those weird murderous eyes. But they say they can be customized and
*  I don't know. I do have faith. I do have faith in our community. I have faith in our industry that
*  that we are creative enough to get through this. And and we're just fucking stubborn as fuck. We're
*  all so stubborn. We do this for for the love of doing it. Well, it's making people happy.
*  You work so hard and anybody who knows anybody that works in the restaurant business understands
*  that it is a long grind. I have faith in you guys. I just don't have faith in the government.
*  I don't have faith in what the way they've handled this. Why should we? Yeah. I just listen,
*  there's just there's a complete lack of of leadership at the top, complete fucking lack
*  of leadership. And that's it. It's fucking depressing, man. Yeah, it's fucking depressing.
*  And again, the fish stinks from the head down. But listen, I'm in your corner. I know you are. And
*  we appreciate you. And I know that you've mentioned Felix a couple of times on the podcast. And
*  you know, it's really it's really appreciated. And we all need help. Restaurants in general
*  all need help. I just love when someone does anything with the kind of passion that you guys
*  display at your restaurant, whatever it is, whether you're making music or you're writing
*  books or you're making food. I just love when someone does something like that, because it
*  makes me excited about all the things that I do. I think we you know, and you know, as human beings,
*  as we interact with each other, and we explore each other's lives, and what other people do for
*  living what their passions are, you get energized by that you get energized by other people's work,
*  by their enthusiasm, their enthusiasm is really contagious. You know, and that's one thing that
*  I've really got out of your restaurant. It's it's very contagious. It's very obvious you guys take
*  extreme pride in what you do. And you do it so well. Yeah, thank you. No, it's it's what keeps
*  me going is is the like you said, it's the enthusiasm of our staff and the people that
*  come back to our restaurant again and again, and it's what keeps us going. You know, that's our
*  reward. And we're so used to that immediate reward of sending the food to the table and seeing people
*  enjoy it. That's like the drug to us is making people happy. It's it's immediate and the camaraderie
*  of everybody working together to provide that. Yeah. And the good news is we're not going anywhere.
*  And we know now that we are going to make it to the other side. Beautiful. I'll be there. We can't wait.
*  Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you so much. Thank you, Joe. My pleasure. I can't wait to eat
*  there again. Can't wait to have you. We did it. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye.
*  Oh, that's a relief to take those off.
