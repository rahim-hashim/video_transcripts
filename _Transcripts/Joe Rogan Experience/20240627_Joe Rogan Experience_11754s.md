# JRE MMA Show #142 with Matt Serra, Din Thomas & John Rallo
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6.0s)]
*  We're up, we're up. Boys, what's happening? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=12.0s)]
*  What a beautiful moment to get you guys together in a room. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=15.0s)]
*  This is awesome. This is badass. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=18.0s)]
*  This is fucking awesome. I've known all you guys for fucking ever. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=20.0s)]
*  I think I've known you the longest. I've known you for at least 20 years. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=23.0s)]
*  2001, I believe. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=28.0s)]
*  I remember you were sleeping in your dojo. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=30.0s)]
*  He had a bucket of like a thing he would piss in. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=34.0s)]
*  Because he drank so much water, so he had his jug next to his bed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=38.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm tired, I don't want to get up. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=43.0s)]
*  I don't want to get up and go to the bathroom. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=45.0s)]
*  I gotta piss, I just piss right there and go back to sleep. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=47.0s)]
*  I lived in my first Thorfront Academy in East Meadow, my hometown. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=49.0s)]
*  And Joe and Eddie Brawa were in town for some reason. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=54.0s)]
*  I think you were doing a gig. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=56.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing a gig and you came and picked us up. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah, at the Hicksville train station. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=60.0s)]
*  We took the train and he picked us up at the train station, took us to his academy. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=62.0s)]
*  It was awesome. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah, at the Hicksville train station. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=67.0s)]
*  And it was literally, not to make everybody feel old, it was 21 years ago. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=69.0s)]
*  I was 28. You know why I remember? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=74.0s)]
*  Because I was going to fight BJ Penn at Mohegan Sun. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=76.0s)]
*  So I'm like, are you going? You're like, I got this gig. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=79.0s)]
*  And you came, you trained at my place and I showed you the basement. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=82.0s)]
*  I'll never forget what you said to me down there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=85.0s)]
*  And I think I said it the last time I was here. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=87.0s)]
*  I go, y'all man, this is where I sleep, this is where I stay. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=89.0s)]
*  You looked at it and you go, dude, you live like a fucking Spartan. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=92.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=95.0s)]
*  I remember it like it was yesterday. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=97.0s)]
*  Well, you were living that life. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=99.0s)]
*  I mean, and I think that's what you have to do to be elite at MMA when you're starting out, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=101.0s)]
*  especially back then. You had to be all in. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=106.0s)]
*  All in. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=110.0s)]
*  All in. And you're a coach of high level people. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=111.0s)]
*  You could speak to this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, I've also lived that life too. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=115.0s)]
*  Back in 2001, I fought BJ in 2001. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=117.0s)]
*  So I mean, I know what it's like to live in the car. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=121.0s)]
*  I still do it sometimes now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=124.0s)]
*  Do you sleep in your car? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=126.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=128.0s)]
*  Just for old times sake. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=130.0s)]
*  I'll be on the road so much, man. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=131.0s)]
*  And sometimes I don't even know where I'm going. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=133.0s)]
*  I'll be on the road so much. I'm like, God damn. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=135.0s)]
*  Dean Thomas got a lot of jobs, these days. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=137.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=139.0s)]
*  You know what it was? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=140.0s)]
*  I remember talking to you and you said, man, I work a lot because I know what it's like to be poor. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=142.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=146.0s)]
*  So like, that's why I work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=147.0s)]
*  Yeah, I stay ahead. I don't ever want to think about money. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=148.0s)]
*  I don't think about money, but the way to not think about money is to make enough so you don't have to think about it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=151.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=155.0s)]
*  And I met you around the same time because I met you and Eddie as well through Jiu Jitsu. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=156.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=162.0s)]
*  You guys were on the underground back in the day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=163.0s)]
*  And we were trying to find a place to watch the fights. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=165.0s)]
*  In Baltimore. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=167.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had a gig. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=168.0s)]
*  So Eddie went to your place. Was it Pride? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah, we went. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=171.0s)]
*  Was it Pride or was it the UFC? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=172.0s)]
*  It was UFC. He actually fought, because I remember you saying, because we both thought he beat BJ, even though you didn't get the decision. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=173.0s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=182.0s)]
*  You were at the Improv, I believe, in Baltimore at the time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=184.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=188.0s)]
*  And then we hit ESPN Zone for dinner. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=192.0s)]
*  And I got to be friends with you guys ever since. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=193.0s)]
*  Yeah, Ronald and I have had some fun on the road, man. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=195.0s)]
*  We've been to a lot of gigs together. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=198.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=200.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=201.0s)]
*  It's just like those friendships that you make in the early days, they're kind of special. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=202.0s)]
*  Because we were there, you know, when the UFC in 2001 was a different thing, man. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=207.0s)]
*  Completely. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=213.0s)]
*  Different animal. It was so fringe. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=214.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=216.0s)]
*  And you always felt like, I just personally, I always felt like it was going to be over any second. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=221.0s)]
*  I would never be like, all right, look, I'll take this next fight at this price because this is going to be fucking down. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=222.0s)]
*  This is going to be coming to an end soon. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=227.0s)]
*  And I'll tell my kids that one time I fought in a cage. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=229.0s)]
*  It should be the sport where we fought in a cage. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=231.0s)]
*  It looked like the end was coming at any moment. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=233.0s)]
*  It really did. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=236.0s)]
*  Before that, the fight with Forrest Griffin and Stefan Bonner. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=237.0s)]
*  You know what's really crazy? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=240.0s)]
*  Eddie Bravo and I used to have this conversation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=241.0s)]
*  We would be like, because I met Eddie in like 1998. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=244.0s)]
*  I met him at a thing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=248.0s)]
*  I either met him at John Jocks, but I saw him at John Jocks. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=251.0s)]
*  He was there with Ricky Rocket. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=254.0s)]
*  Like Ricky Rocket from Poison is a legit black belt under John Jock Machado. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=256.0s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=261.0s)]
*  Ricky Rocket is a real, he trained. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=262.0s)]
*  Undercover. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=265.0s)]
*  You know, just just regular dude goes into classes. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=267.0s)]
*  Legit. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=270.0s)]
*  Like real guy. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=271.0s)]
*  So anyway, Eddie was there with him as spectator. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=272.0s)]
*  And like this is like 1998. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=275.0s)]
*  And we would say, you know what this sport needs? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=279.0s)]
*  Some crazy billionaires to just invest all this money in it because we know how exciting it is. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=281.0s)]
*  But the world didn't know this is, you know, this is 98 is like Dan Henderson's first fight. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=287.0s)]
*  Carlos Newton. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=292.0s)]
*  Remember back in those days, remember Carlos Newton? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=294.0s)]
*  A lot of people forgot about that fucking. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=297.0s)]
*  I still talk to him like he's on the commission, the committee that the ABC commission has for fighters. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=299.0s)]
*  And I'm on that commission with Carlos Newton. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=305.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=307.0s)]
*  What about? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=308.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=309.0s)]
*  What does he do now? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=310.0s)]
*  He's like working like real estate or construction or something. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=311.0s)]
*  He's doing OK. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=314.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's alive. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=315.0s)]
*  I like when I see guys make it through OK. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=316.0s)]
*  Because I mean, now I talk about this with Dean a lot. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=320.0s)]
*  And we're on the road with Dana doing the shot. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=322.0s)]
*  I got survivor's guilt. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=324.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=325.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't fucking. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=326.0s)]
*  There's a lot of guys now that the sport's like 30 years old. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=328.0s)]
*  There's a lot. There's like casualties in the game now, whether it's the health, whether they get done with the sport. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=331.0s)]
*  And I mean, Phil Barone is in a Mexican prison right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=336.0s)]
*  War machine. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=339.0s)]
*  I mean, these are the best. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=340.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=341.0s)]
*  There's some people making very bad choices. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=342.0s)]
*  But I don't know, man. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=344.0s)]
*  It's upsetting to me when I see people all fucked up and we're sitting there hanging out having a good time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=346.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=351.0s)]
*  You know, it's hard when people forget, too, about the early days were not that popular. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=352.0s)]
*  So they forget about some spectacular performances. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=357.0s)]
*  They forget about some. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=360.0s)]
*  When Carlos Newton tapped out Pat Miletich with a Bulldog, remember the first time I'd never seen anybody do that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=362.0s)]
*  No, that was dead. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=368.0s)]
*  That was something else. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=369.0s)]
*  I fought on that call. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=370.0s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=371.0s)]
*  Back Christmas by showing you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=372.0s)]
*  There's a photo of him and he is. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=373.0s)]
*  And Pat's face is like. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=376.0s)]
*  You can find the photo of Carlos Newton. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=379.0s)]
*  Look at this photo. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=382.0s)]
*  Look. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=383.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=384.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=385.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=386.0s)]
*  And there's like another one, two of it, like more from the back. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=387.0s)]
*  But either way, like what a perfect picture. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=390.0s)]
*  I mean, that is so nasty. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=393.0s)]
*  He was a he was a fluent fighter. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=395.0s)]
*  He was very. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=397.0s)]
*  He was the first one. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=398.0s)]
*  Look at his fucking arm. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=399.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=401.0s)]
*  He was one of the very best grapplers in the early days of the UFC. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=403.0s)]
*  He pulled off some wild shit. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=406.0s)]
*  Phenomenal Jiu Jitsu. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=408.0s)]
*  Remember, he got in that triangle. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=410.0s)]
*  And Matt slammed him and KO'd him. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=412.0s)]
*  They both went to sleep. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=414.0s)]
*  And then Matt just woke up first. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=415.0s)]
*  He's like, I won. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=416.0s)]
*  I won. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=417.0s)]
*  He was surprised. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=418.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=419.0s)]
*  It's funny looking at all these pitches and everything, you know, pre-USADA. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=420.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=425.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=426.0s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=427.0s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=428.0s)]
*  Let's talk. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=429.0s)]
*  Listen, and by the way, this is me at 49 on TOT. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=430.0s)]
*  OK, so I'm not competing now on anything. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=434.0s)]
*  I never competed, did anything ever. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=436.0s)]
*  So I remember like I like some guys that I've been competing with. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=439.0s)]
*  I've been competing with a lot of guys. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=443.0s)]
*  I remember like I like some guys back then. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=445.0s)]
*  But fuck, man, like Randy control, the natural. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=449.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=452.0s)]
*  The natural? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=453.0s)]
*  Can we get a different nickname? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=455.0s)]
*  I like Randy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=458.0s)]
*  I have the expendables and shit. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=459.0s)]
*  But you know, I mean, of all the nicknames. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=461.0s)]
*  Can I have a little more of that? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=464.0s)]
*  I'm an espresso freak. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=467.0s)]
*  Want espresso? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh, no, I'll have coffee. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=469.0s)]
*  I'll have coffee. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=470.0s)]
*  We'll get you some espresso. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=471.0s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=472.0s)]
*  Can we get four espressos? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=473.0s)]
*  You guys are awesome. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=475.0s)]
*  Like you look at it's different when you look at the Pride guys, because they were almost encouraging that shit. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=477.0s)]
*  They were encouraging. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=481.0s)]
*  One of Eddie's guys went over there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=482.0s)]
*  They literally told him to gain weight. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=486.0s)]
*  You want to get you on steroids, get up to 185. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=487.0s)]
*  They wanted that whole freak show and watching the biggest guys kill each other. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=492.0s)]
*  I wonder, like I know I fought BJ. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=493.0s)]
*  I know I believe him when he says he was natural. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=495.0s)]
*  But I wonder how many dudes I fought that were actually on something. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=497.0s)]
*  I think BJ was 100% natural. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=500.0s)]
*  I believe him. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=502.0s)]
*  I believe him 100%. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=503.0s)]
*  And also there's no change in his physique ever. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=504.0s)]
*  BJ was all about whether or not BJ was fully dedicated. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=506.0s)]
*  The fully dedicated BJ was a terrifying force. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=510.0s)]
*  To me, I still believe he's the greatest lightweight of all time. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=513.0s)]
*  I think you can make a real good argument that the prime BJ, when he beat Diego Sanchez, I would put that up against anybody ever. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=516.0s)]
*  Yeah, Diego Sanchez, Shirk, all those guys. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=524.0s)]
*  I'm not saying Khabib couldn't beat him, because Khabib was a motherfucker. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=526.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't think we really can appreciate how much of a motherfucker he is until after he's long gone. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=531.0s)]
*  You go by him, like that Edson Barboza fight. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=536.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=538.0s)]
*  He put that thousand yard stare in Edson Barboza early in that fight. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=539.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=543.0s)]
*  Where he was like, oh my God, like this motherfucker. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=544.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know if he, he might be able to do that to everybody. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=546.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=549.0s)]
*  It seemed that way, but BJ was on a different level. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=550.0s)]
*  He was on an insane level. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=552.0s)]
*  Prime BJ was on a different level. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=554.0s)]
*  And he had legs. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=556.0s)]
*  There's this thousand yard stare. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=557.0s)]
*  He had, BJ had legs that were like arms. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=558.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=561.0s)]
*  His dexterity. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=562.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=563.0s)]
*  I heard he could put his legs behind his head without using his hands. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=566.0s)]
*  And he stretches them. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=567.0s)]
*  It's not like it's just totally natural. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=568.0s)]
*  He was telling me all these crazy things he does with bands. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=570.0s)]
*  You know, when he stretches himself with bands. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=572.0s)]
*  He does like hardcore, yeah, hardcore stretching shit. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=575.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild that even the most flexible motherfucker is, if you get them in the crucifix, it doesn't matter if they can suck their own dick, they're still getting fucked up. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=578.0s)]
*  When you've got a guy, BJ Penn, you ever see BJ Penn? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=585.0s)]
*  The guy's jumping out of pools and shit. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=593.0s)]
*  Like, Matt, he was getting some here in the crucifix. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=597.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=600.0s)]
*  You can put your legs behind your head. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=601.0s)]
*  He should have used his legs to fucking block the fucking, you know, do some wing chung with your legs. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=603.0s)]
*  He was, the crucifix fucks you up. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=609.0s)]
*  I get, gi or no gi, I go for that all the time training. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=612.0s)]
*  And I know I can't, yeah, and I know I can't hit them, but there's a lot of ways you could transfer, transition into kimoras, arm locks, different things. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=617.0s)]
*  But it's such a good thing to get used to because they can't do dick. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=626.0s)]
*  DC might not, I don't know how great his jiu-jitsu is, but I mean, look, he gets guys in the crucifix. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=630.0s)]
*  They're fucking done. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=634.0s)]
*  The crucifix is, there was one guy at John Jock's who specialized in the crucifix. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=636.0s)]
*  I was always terrified of this dude because it's such a terrible place to be. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=641.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=645.0s)]
*  You can't use your arms and you're like, ah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=646.0s)]
*  It's such a horrible experience. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=648.0s)]
*  And you're punched in the face and you're like trying to block with that one little hand. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=649.0s)]
*  With MMA, it's so much worse. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=652.0s)]
*  It's the elbows from that position. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=654.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=656.0s)]
*  Oh my God, punches. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=657.0s)]
*  When I was fighting Matt, when I was getting ready to fight Matt Hughes, I was having people start me from there. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=658.0s)]
*  And that's why the only fight I ever in my career I had to pull out of was our first time I was supposed to meet Matt Hughes. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=663.0s)]
*  And that literally broke my heart because I was talking such shit. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=670.0s)]
*  And I would never talk shit. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=674.0s)]
*  I only talk shit knowing that I'm going to meet this guy in a cage. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=676.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=679.0s)]
*  Because they say, you know, he's calling the guy, you know, every other day I'm calling the guy a dick. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=680.0s)]
*  But I know we're meeting. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=685.0s)]
*  Then I had to pull out of the fight. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=686.0s)]
*  And part of the reason why I had to pull out of the fight is because I was getting older at the time and I still training like a younger guy. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=688.0s)]
*  So I was starting in the crucifix with my buddy Craig, who was like a fucking big strong motherfucker. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=695.0s)]
*  And then I'd get out at the five minutes. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=702.0s)]
*  I would do duck under suplex. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=704.0s)]
*  Then I cooled off. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=706.0s)]
*  You know, Matt Arroyo, he was visiting. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=708.0s)]
*  So he asked me to show a move. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=712.0s)]
*  I cooled down and dude, I fucking blew my back out just showing something. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=713.0s)]
*  I went to show something. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=717.0s)]
*  I guess I was so fucking like from doing shit. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=718.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was training so physical and not as smart. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=721.0s)]
*  So I had to pull out of the fight. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=724.0s)]
*  But the point was back. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=726.0s)]
*  I l four and l five. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=728.0s)]
*  I had a herniated discs. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=729.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=731.0s)]
*  So I tried to stay in the I tried to not pull out of the fight. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=732.0s)]
*  So fucking I went to a chiropractor and I will never go to a motherfucking chiropractor again. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=735.0s)]
*  He took out this Tonka toy thing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=742.0s)]
*  You see your spine is you got to and I go, dude, I don't know what you're doing. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=744.0s)]
*  I go, but just could you do something for me? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=748.0s)]
*  He goes, everybody thinks they have a herniated disc because I mean, I'm sitting like I'm thinking about it. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=750.0s)]
*  I'm sitting the way I was sitting. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=754.0s)]
*  I was like, I was like, not straight. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=755.0s)]
*  I go, dude, something's not right here. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=757.0s)]
*  He goes, everybody thinks it's a herniation, but it's a lot of times it's yada yada. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=759.0s)]
*  He put me on a thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=763.0s)]
*  He put me upside down on one of those. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=764.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=766.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=767.0s)]
*  And then he was with someone else. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=769.0s)]
*  And then he was with someone else. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=772.0s)]
*  And then I'm with my wife. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=773.0s)]
*  And then he goes, OK, like almost like I'm a fucking turkey. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=774.0s)]
*  I flip him over. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=777.0s)]
*  You could turn him back over. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=778.0s)]
*  When he turned, I guess everything was coming back down on my stuff when he turned me back over. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=780.0s)]
*  I was fucking fucking screaming like something's sticking in me. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=785.0s)]
*  And then he charged me 50 bucks. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=790.0s)]
*  You know, you know, they call themselves doctors. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=793.0s)]
*  Do you know how much time they spend in medical school? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=796.0s)]
*  Zero. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=798.0s)]
*  How many? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=799.0s)]
*  Zero. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=800.0s)]
*  Zero time. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=801.0s)]
*  Zero. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=802.0s)]
*  It's fucking. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=803.0s)]
*  Do you know how it was invented? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=804.0s)]
*  How? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=805.0s)]
*  Pull up the article chiropractors are bullshit. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=806.0s)]
*  Joe, I have chiropractors at home that know I know you and they're like, hey, man, why is he beating up on a chiropractor? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=808.0s)]
*  It's the origin of it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=815.0s)]
*  Look, whether or not I'm not disputing that people get relief from being manipulated, because I think there's something to the deep tissue aspect of it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=816.0s)]
*  There's probably something even to being out of alignment in certain conditions, you know, and a lot of that could be because a little injuries and things are tight. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=824.0s)]
*  And that's why deep tissue massage and roughing is very effective. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=832.0s)]
*  But the origins of the medical art, it came from a guy who was a magnetic healer who came up with this idea is going to cure all illnesses by manipulating your spine. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=836.0s)]
*  And the speculation is he was murdered by his son, who was a con man, and his son that fucking takes it everywhere. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=848.0s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=856.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=858.0s)]
*  Did pull up the article, pull up that article again, because it's like when you read it, you're like, what? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=859.0s)]
*  Is this real? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=864.0s)]
*  So, you know, I always thought it was a doctor. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=866.0s)]
*  But it's not. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=869.0s)]
*  It's not a doctor. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=870.0s)]
*  It was like his son. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=871.0s)]
*  It's this a thing that like you may find relief from. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=873.0s)]
*  You may find relief from being manipulated. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=877.0s)]
*  And I think there's guys out there that are really good at like they use other stuff with different techniques with it. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=879.0s)]
*  They're basically doing physical therapy. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=885.0s)]
*  But the knowledge and philosophy given given me by Dr. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=887.0s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=892.0s)]
*  Palmer held seances to contact a dead physician named Jim Atkinson. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=893.0s)]
*  He said that those seances helped him develop chiropractic, as he wrote in his 1914 book, The Chiropractor, the knowledge and philosophy given me by Dr. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=899.0s)]
*  Jim Atkinson, an intelligent spiritual being together with explanations of pneumonia phenomena rather just a phenomena principles [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=908.0s)]
*  resolved from causes, effects, powers, laws and utility appealed to my reason. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=918.0s)]
*  The method by which I obtained an explanation of certain physical phenomena from an intelligence in the spiritual world is known in biblical language as inspiration. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=923.0s)]
*  In a great measure, the chiropractors adjuster was written under such spiritual promptings. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=933.0s)]
*  So this guy came up with this from a seance. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=938.0s)]
*  He learned it from a ghost. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=941.0s)]
*  He learned it from a ghost. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=944.0s)]
*  He learned it from a ghost. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=945.0s)]
*  And then the idea behind it, though, is that you could fix all these different problems that people have by adjusting them like all kinds of wild shit. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=946.0s)]
*  And they thought they could see what he said that they thought they could do with it because it's kind of nutty when you read like the stuff that he was saying he could fix. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=956.0s)]
*  Man, I just think it feels good like when you crack your knuckles. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=967.0s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=970.0s)]
*  I think also getting pushed on and rubbed and adjusted. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=972.0s)]
*  It's good for you. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=975.0s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=976.0s)]
*  It's like when I get deep tissue massage, these motherfuckers, they dig in there with their elbows and they're kind of cracking shit and moving. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=977.0s)]
*  There's a lot of tension and you can alleviate that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=983.0s)]
*  I'm not saying that being adjusted or any of these things these people do doesn't offer people help. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=986.0s)]
*  I'm sure it does. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=992.0s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=993.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, where did that come from? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=994.0s)]
*  And why are you calling it that? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=997.0s)]
*  Yeah, so if you want to call it if you want to call like physical maintenance, you know, that's your you're literally attaching something that actually works to something that's really crazy. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=999.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1009.0s)]
*  The origins of this are real. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1010.0s)]
*  Why don't masseuses call themselves doctors? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1012.0s)]
*  It's a similar similar thing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1014.0s)]
*  It's a similar thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1016.0s)]
*  If you have like a really good deep tissue massager, because it's like it's like a disrespectful thing to a medical profession. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1017.0s)]
*  Right. And it makes you question the credibility of everything that they're doing. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1024.0s)]
*  Exactly. But they do help people. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1028.0s)]
*  That's the thing. It's like but you got to admit what it actually is. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1030.0s)]
*  Maybe you should probably take a look at the origins of it. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1033.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, if you want to be attached to that shit, man, I did. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1035.0s)]
*  They didn't do dick for me, but I went to do dick for me either. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1039.0s)]
*  That's how I found out about all this. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1044.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1046.0s)]
*  I had a bulging disk in my fucking neck and I went to a guy for a year who was like telling me, no, it's just, you know, this is a muscle injury. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1047.0s)]
*  And he's like, he pushed down on my head and he was saying, does it hurt when I do that? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1053.0s)]
*  I go, no. He's like, then you don't have a bulging disk. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1057.0s)]
*  Like, how ridiculous is that? Yeah. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1059.0s)]
*  How do you know? I finally went to a real doctor and he gave me an MRI. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1061.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you got a bulging. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1065.0s)]
*  Touch your head. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1066.0s)]
*  Touch my head. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1068.0s)]
*  And then they did Regenekeen on it. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1069.0s)]
*  That's that shit that Dana went to Germany to go paint Manning when Kobe Bryant went over there. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1071.0s)]
*  And it's your own blood. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1077.0s)]
*  It's like a PRP thing, but they add a bunch of stuff to it and that fixed it in two weeks. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1078.0s)]
*  What about that fucking final destination? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1083.0s)]
*  Dana, what the fuck did he do when he got that fucking test when he's like, I'm going to die in 10 years? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1086.0s)]
*  What is that? He went keto. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1090.0s)]
*  What is that? What test was that that he took when he goes, oh, yeah, he told me about this guy. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1092.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that guy? The 10x guy? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1097.0s)]
*  Yeah. Somebody said that he's going to fucking, oh, yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1098.0s)]
*  What did they say? That he's going to probably die in 10 years? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1101.0s)]
*  Something like that. He said if he kept going the way he was going, he could probably die in 10 years. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1104.0s)]
*  But I believe that because Dana was just like, he doesn't sleep. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1108.0s)]
*  He's always going. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1111.0s)]
*  I could call Dana and have a two hour conversation with him at two in the morning. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1113.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's an animal. He don't sleep. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1116.0s)]
*  He's an animal. He just he's just like always doing stuff. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1119.0s)]
*  He's always involved. He's always got deals. He's always working on fights. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1122.0s)]
*  He's always he fucking loves this shit. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1126.0s)]
*  That guy's nuts. He ever it's in my contract that if he leaves, I leave. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1129.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Well, you don't have to worry about nothing. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1133.0s)]
*  He ain't going nowhere. I'm like, I don't want to do this for anybody else. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1136.0s)]
*  He obviously loves it because he does not have to do it. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1140.0s)]
*  Dude, he loves it. I'm telling you right now. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1143.0s)]
*  You call him at any given time and say, Jan Bojovic, Alex Behada. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1145.0s)]
*  Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1150.0s)]
*  And we're going, oh, my God, what the fuck is that going to be like? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1153.0s)]
*  But what is that going to be like, by the way? Oh, what is that going to be like? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1157.0s)]
*  He's hitting on now. Jan Bojovic is fighting Alex Behada. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1161.0s)]
*  Depends where it goes. Well, this is the thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1164.0s)]
*  I think that it's going to be a little I think Jan's going to I think is he's harder to get down than Alex. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1166.0s)]
*  And I think Jan's going to get him down. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1173.0s)]
*  I don't think he's getting up. I don't think so. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1176.0s)]
*  Jan, did he get up every time he got taken down? Well, not in the later rounds. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1179.0s)]
*  You know, Jan Bojovic can grapple. Yeah, that's the thing. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1183.0s)]
*  I don't think it's on the feed. I still think, you know, hey, get some on the ground. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1187.0s)]
*  I don't see how you do. But that left hook. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1191.0s)]
*  Bojovic is very high level on the feet. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1194.0s)]
*  I mean, he's very high level, like he's got this wild thing that he'll do. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1197.0s)]
*  He'll go shin to shin with you. He'll kick your fucking shins. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1201.0s)]
*  Like he's the only guy that I ever see that consistently does that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1205.0s)]
*  And dude, look at that Luke Rockhold. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1208.0s)]
*  But Jan Bojovic, if he gets you down, man, and we saw how bad Alex looked on the ground. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1210.0s)]
*  Yes. Against Izzy, who looked just as almost as bad. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1214.0s)]
*  Yeah, he did not look good. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1218.0s)]
*  But you know, you could say that he never anticipated that from Izzy. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1221.0s)]
*  And he anticipated a straight up kickboxing match because that's most of Izzy's fights. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1225.0s)]
*  He never tries to take it. Right, for sure. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1229.0s)]
*  He could have said he made a mistake in that regard. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1231.0s)]
*  I mean, but there's a certain natural movements that you do if you are competent on the ground. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1233.0s)]
*  Like your legs are, you know, your body's round and you're using your legs. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1238.0s)]
*  I mean, he was pretty like a, he was like a board. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1241.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was very low level. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1244.0s)]
*  But you know what? If a guy can get that good at stand up, he's so fucking good. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1247.0s)]
*  He's so sneaky. Yeah. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1252.0s)]
*  He's the sneakiest calf kicker in the history of calf kicks. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1254.0s)]
*  Yeah. His shit is so high level and you don't realize it. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1257.0s)]
*  It was even better in the second fight. Yeah. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1261.0s)]
*  He's got this way of lifting that front leg and then no hip switch at all. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1263.0s)]
*  He just boom. It's crazy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1267.0s)]
*  Can I just say I'm glad I'm out of the game before they fucking put in these damn calf kicks? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1269.0s)]
*  I don't want that shit. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1274.0s)]
*  I'm glad I fucking, I never took one kick in my calf. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1276.0s)]
*  I tell you what, my last fight in the UFC I fought Josh Neer and he inadvertently kicked me in the calf. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1280.0s)]
*  I thought my leg was broke. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1285.0s)]
*  Wow. I was just pulling guard at that point. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1287.0s)]
*  It's worse now. Yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1289.0s)]
*  So no one, I didn't know what a calf kick. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1291.0s)]
*  Well, I thought, you know, you're just trying to kick my leg. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1293.0s)]
*  It just happened to hit the calf and like I was done. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1295.0s)]
*  Josh Neer is another bad motherfucker that people forgot. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1298.0s)]
*  They call him the dentist. Yeah. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1301.0s)]
*  Dude, it was awesome. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1303.0s)]
*  Man, there's a lot of guys that people got to throw their name in the old UFC fight pass because like guys like Chris Lytle, they should get him. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1304.0s)]
*  I want them to be known. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1311.0s)]
*  Eve Edwards. Eve Edwards is in his prime. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1313.0s)]
*  Very good. When he knocked out Josh Thompson, I was saying that Eve Edwards is the best 155 pounder alive, but there wasn't a UFC championship for him back then. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1317.0s)]
*  I was there when he knocked out Masvidal too because I had a guy on, it was Bodog actually in New Jersey. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1326.0s)]
*  He head kicked Masvidal. No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1332.0s)]
*  You got it backwards. Was it Edwards? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1334.0s)]
*  Masvidal head kicked him. Did he? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1336.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, yeah. Masvidal KO'd him. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1338.0s)]
*  It was a huge victory for Masvidal. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1340.0s)]
*  About to meet a real enemy there with that one. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1342.0s)]
*  He switched that one up entirely. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1344.0s)]
*  Remember the time I backfisted Shoney? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1348.0s)]
*  I do remember that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1350.0s)]
*  Shoney Carter. I was there for that one too. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1352.0s)]
*  Shoney Carter was awesome. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1354.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is it right here. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1356.0s)]
*  Boom. Boom. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1358.0s)]
*  Got me right. Beautiful. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1360.0s)]
*  And I've been thinking it's the other way around. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1362.0s)]
*  Even back then, look at that. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1364.0s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1366.0s)]
*  Even back then, that dude's hilarious. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1368.0s)]
*  That dude was hilarious. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1370.0s)]
*  Nick Diaz on Anderson. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1372.0s)]
*  I fought Eve Edwards right after 9-11. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1374.0s)]
*  September 28th, UFC 33. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1378.0s)]
*  That's when me and you beat each other. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1380.0s)]
*  You fought Fabiano de Iha. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1382.0s)]
*  Where the fuck is that guy now? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1384.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1386.0s)]
*  How many arm bars did that guy have? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1388.0s)]
*  He had a lot. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1390.0s)]
*  He was just grabbing the guy's arms and throwing his legs around. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1392.0s)]
*  I tell you, put it on him though. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1394.0s)]
*  Fucking Mr. Thomas. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1396.0s)]
*  Put them hands on the boy. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1398.0s)]
*  I remember he had those corn rolls at the time. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1400.0s)]
*  They weren't even corn rolls. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1404.0s)]
*  He had them cut him in. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1406.0s)]
*  It was his haircut. He had lines cut. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1408.0s)]
*  Beat the shit out of him, Dean Thomas. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1410.0s)]
*  We were both coming off... [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1412.0s)]
*  We both had our initial fights in the UFC. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1414.0s)]
*  We both had hype and we both fucked that up. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1418.0s)]
*  You lost to BJ. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1420.0s)]
*  You lost to BJ Pence. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1422.0s)]
*  I lost to Shoni Carter. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1424.0s)]
*  Now it's UFC 33 in Vegas. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1426.0s)]
*  It's at the end of September. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1430.0s)]
*  It's right after 9-11. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1432.0s)]
*  I went out with Ray Longo. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1434.0s)]
*  His wife didn't let him get on a plane. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1436.0s)]
*  It was a weird time. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1438.0s)]
*  It was a ghost town. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1440.0s)]
*  It was fucking crazy. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1442.0s)]
*  I thought Eve Edwards was a better striker than Shoni. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1444.0s)]
*  It was a crazy night. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1446.0s)]
*  I was just having a conversation with the people about the Gracie documentary. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1448.0s)]
*  We were talking about right after September 11 when Tito fought Maddu Shanko. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1452.0s)]
*  That was the same card. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1456.0s)]
*  That was a wild night. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1458.0s)]
*  I was in the audience. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1460.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yeah. That was before I worked for the UFC again. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1464.0s)]
*  Oh, you were there? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1466.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was at that event. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1468.0s)]
*  We fought on this, Dean. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1470.0s)]
*  This was when they had their first big event in the UFC in Vegas. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1472.0s)]
*  In Vegas, yeah. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1476.0s)]
*  I wanted to be there for it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1478.0s)]
*  I was like, God, we got to go. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1480.0s)]
*  I became friends with Dana through that. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1482.0s)]
*  That's how I started doing commentary. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1484.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1486.0s)]
*  Yeah, I became friends with him. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1488.0s)]
*  I fought. I was the first fighter that night. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1490.0s)]
*  Against Fabiano Iha. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1492.0s)]
*  You know what's funny, man? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1494.0s)]
*  I don't know if you're going to remember this. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1496.0s)]
*  It's fitting since I gave you a new T-shirt. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1498.0s)]
*  When we first started getting to talk, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1500.0s)]
*  it was after I beat Kelly Delante. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1502.0s)]
*  It was on a prelim. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1504.0s)]
*  I remember that. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1506.0s)]
*  I ended up getting a triangle on him. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1508.0s)]
*  It was on a prelim, but they showed it right before the main event. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1510.0s)]
*  It got a lot of views. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1512.0s)]
*  Then they interviewed you. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1514.0s)]
*  You weren't doing the commentary yet, but you did say [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1516.0s)]
*  it was something along the lines of [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1518.0s)]
*  people think the ground is in the air. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1520.0s)]

*  and you ended up calling the Academy. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1560.0s)]
*  I swear, you called the Academy to thank me or some shit [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1562.0s)]
*  and I got on the phone with you and I was all excited. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1566.0s)]
*  That's the old days. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1569.0s)]
*  You would get texts back then. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1571.0s)]
*  You called to say thanks for the shirt. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1573.0s)]
*  Bro, nobody texted back then. In 2001 it didn't exist. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1575.0s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't texted. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1577.0s)]
*  It wasn't texted. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1579.0s)]
*  We called each other. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1581.0s)]
*  We're the last generation. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1583.0s)]
*  Of calling people. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1585.0s)]
*  And most of the time it was on a real phone. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1587.0s)]
*  A real phone. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1589.0s)]
*  What's bad now is I never checked my email [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1591.0s)]

*  I just go to my school and I go home [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1615.0s)]
*  and now since the pandemic had some blessings [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1617.0s)]
*  because I used to have to go to the city [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1619.0s)]
*  to hang out and I do UFC Unfiltered with Jimmy. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1621.0s)]
*  Jimmy's doing your show. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1623.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1625.0s)]
*  I love Jimmy. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1627.0s)]
*  Jimmy like little Jimmy Bird. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1629.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1631.0s)]
*  He's a beautiful human being. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1633.0s)]
*  I love Jim Norton. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1635.0s)]
*  I've been doing that show for a while with him. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1637.0s)]
*  What was I going to do? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1639.0s)]
*  Because you don't go to New York for it anyway. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1641.0s)]
*  Oh, okay, okay, the pandemic. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1643.0s)]
*  Sorry, guys, nothing changes. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1645.0s)]
*  So I used to have to go to the city [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1647.0s)]
*  because I do UFC Unfiltered with Jimmy [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1649.0s)]
*  and I always felt like I was winning [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1651.0s)]
*  because it's a decent paying gig. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1653.0s)]
*  It's a fun time with Jimmy. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1655.0s)]
*  I go in after rush hour. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1657.0s)]
*  I come out before it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1659.0s)]
*  But then since the pandemic, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1661.0s)]
*  man, now I just get a green screen in my fucking room. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1663.0s)]
*  So now I can be at my school. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1665.0s)]
*  I take a little nap, hang out with Jimmy [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1667.0s)]
*  and fucking on Zoom, do the podcast, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1669.0s)]
*  go back, watch my kids strangle people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1671.0s)]
*  So I'm at the school twice as much [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1673.0s)]
*  and I do my podcast still. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1675.0s)]
*  The only time I really leave the house otherwise [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1677.0s)]
*  is the fights, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1679.0s)]
*  cornering people, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1681.0s)]
*  and hanging out with Dean Thomas doing, looking for a fight. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1683.0s)]
*  Don't you think there's something missing [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1685.0s)]
*  when you're doing a podcast [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1687.0s)]
*  with someone that they're not in the room with you? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1689.0s)]
*  Oh, man, don't rock the boat. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1691.0s)]
*  I'm having a good time. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1693.0s)]
*  I'm having a good time. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1695.0s)]
*  No, don't get me wrong. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1697.0s)]
*  It's true. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1699.0s)]
*  No, you're right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1701.0s)]
*  It's true. We have a good time. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1703.0s)]
*  There goes my 7 a.m. class. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1705.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1707.0s)]
*  I love hanging out with Jimmy in the room. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1709.0s)]
*  But we have a good time on the show, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1711.0s)]
*  don't we? [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1713.0s)]
*  Yeah, I come on every once in a while. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1715.0s)]
*  And I'm able to be, because sometimes when I go to the city [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1717.0s)]
*  and by the time I get back, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1719.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm heading into the academy now. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1721.0s)]
*  But now, man, oh, well, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1723.0s)]
*  and that was so much better than that. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1725.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, you're the guy with the real job. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1727.0s)]
*  What do you mean? You're running an academy. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1729.0s)]
*  Why do you get Jimmy to come out to you? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1731.0s)]
*  Set up a fucking... [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1733.0s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1735.0s)]
*  Set up a little fucking studio in your town. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1737.0s)]
*  Jimmy does the serious radio. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1739.0s)]
*  Not serious radio. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1741.0s)]
*  Get out the fucking Uber and get out the long aisle. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1743.0s)]
*  What is this nonsense? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1745.0s)]
*  Get on the train. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1747.0s)]
*  What is he doing all day? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1749.0s)]
*  He's jacking off and fucking watching TV. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1751.0s)]
*  He does his serious XM shit. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1753.0s)]
*  So it's near his house. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1755.0s)]
*  Oh, he does that every day? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1757.0s)]
*  He does that fucking like five days a week, the Jim and Sam show. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1759.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't know it was every day. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1761.0s)]
*  So it's just like Opie and Anthony. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1763.0s)]
*  It's like Opie and Anthony, but it's Jim and Sam. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1765.0s)]
*  So he's got that gig going. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1767.0s)]
*  I'm sure that place pays really good. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1769.0s)]
*  So, you know, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1771.0s)]
*  I didn't mind taking the hit going to the city, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1773.0s)]
*  but now I do since it's a fucking [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1775.0s)]
*  shit hole in there now. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1777.0s)]
*  I used to hang out in there. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1779.0s)]
*  How much has it changed? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1781.0s)]
*  I haven't been in there [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1783.0s)]
*  two minutes. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1785.0s)]
*  I haven't been in there since that much, but [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1787.0s)]
*  I know it's shitty for my friends that [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1789.0s)]
*  live there and from what [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1791.0s)]
*  I've seen. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1793.0s)]
*  I used to be, how about this? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1795.0s)]
*  I used to be able to go on with [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1797.0s)]
*  old school headphones, kind of [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1799.0s)]
*  like this. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1801.0s)]
*  I used to train [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1803.0s)]
*  in the morning. I used to get my head [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1805.0s)]
*  straight and I'd go there, just whistle. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1807.0s)]
*  Now I'm going to be there like fucking Kurt Russell [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1809.0s)]
*  and that motherfucker. I'm not going to be in there [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1811.0s)]
*  like chilling, walking the fucking [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1813.0s)]
*  you have to be on guard. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1815.0s)]
*  It's fucking nasty, dude. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1817.0s)]
*  A couple times I've been in there, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1819.0s)]
*  it is what it is, but [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1821.0s)]
*  I think you get a sense of what it's like there now. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1823.0s)]
*  It's not, you just got to have your guard up. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1825.0s)]
*  I did not feel, and I never [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1827.0s)]
*  lower my sword, but I didn't have [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1829.0s)]
*  to feel like I was so on edge. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1831.0s)]
*  You see shit all the time on the fucking subway. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1833.0s)]
*  The guy got choked to death on the subway there. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1835.0s)]
*  I'm hearing all these different stories in that. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1843.0s)]
*  Did the guy get choked to death? Is that what happened? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1847.0s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1851.0s)]
*  The guy was threatening people on a train. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1853.0s)]
*  The guy, I don't know, there was a Marine. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1857.0s)]
*  He put him in a choke hold. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1859.0s)]
*  I don't know how long he held it for. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1861.0s)]
*  I don't know how well he's trained. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1863.0s)]
*  So this is the thing. The people at home, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1865.0s)]
*  when they put a choke hold on, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1867.0s)]
*  when you're doing it correctly, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1869.0s)]
*  it stops the carotid arteries. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1871.0s)]
*  I know we all know this guy, so I'm just working. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1873.0s)]
*  It stops the blood flow. It doesn't stop the air. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1875.0s)]
*  But if you stop the blood flow for 15 minutes, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1877.0s)]
*  the motherfucker's not coming back. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1879.0s)]
*  So I don't know what happened, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1881.0s)]
*  how long he kept it on and what not. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1883.0s)]
*  But the guy who did have the choke hold on him [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1885.0s)]
*  had a fucking arrest warrant [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1889.0s)]
*  out for punching a fucking 60-something-year-old lady in the face. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1891.0s)]
*  Dude, he had like 40-something. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1895.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 40-something arrests. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1897.0s)]
*  No, this wasn't your, you know, upstanding citizen. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1899.0s)]
*  Look, there were three other people involved [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1901.0s)]
*  that were holding him when this guy tried to restrain him, too. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1903.0s)]
*  So everybody felt threatened. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1906.0s)]
*  But this is what was weird. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1908.0s)]
*  It's like they made it a race thing, too. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1910.0s)]
*  And the problem was to do that, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1912.0s)]
*  they had to omit the fact that the other guy helping him was black. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1914.0s)]
*  So there's a black guy that's helping him hold him down, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1918.0s)]
*  and the guy's got his arm around this dude. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1921.0s)]
*  And most of the people on the subway came out in defense of this guy, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1923.0s)]
*  said, you know, thank you for helping to protect him. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1928.0s)]
*  You always got to make a narrative of you don't know what's the truth. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1931.0s)]
*  Unless you were there. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1933.0s)]
*  There's also a problem with people that are that fucked up. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1935.0s)]
*  Like, that guy might have been high as shit on fentanyl. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1937.0s)]
*  He might have been ready to die anyway. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1940.0s)]
*  You know, and if you get in a scramble with that dude, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1943.0s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you got him in a headlock, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1945.0s)]
*  you might have a fucking heart attack and die. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1947.0s)]
*  And I kind of feel bad for the dude because I know if it was me, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1949.0s)]
*  I'm choking the motherfucker out. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1953.0s)]
*  And I don't care. You know what I'm saying? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1955.0s)]
*  100%. It's your life. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1957.0s)]
*  The fact that that guy might go to jail for that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1959.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's kind of scary. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1962.0s)]
*  Nobody's scared because I'm choking the motherfucker out [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1964.0s)]
*  because I'm trained to do that. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1966.0s)]
*  The only thing that I couldn't, only because I wasn't there, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1968.0s)]
*  is how long did he hold it on? [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1971.0s)]
*  That's the only question I hear. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1973.0s)]
*  What did it look like? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1975.0s)]
*  If I seen a video of him putting to sleep [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1977.0s)]
*  and the guy just didn't wake up, it's like, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1979.0s)]
*  all right, well, maybe the guy shouldn't be fucking attacking people, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1981.0s)]
*  punching 60-something-year-old women in the face and whatever. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1983.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? So there's a case for that. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1986.0s)]
*  But again, I can't go to bed if I don't know how long he held that on for. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1988.0s)]
*  Do you remember when that guy got choked to death [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1991.0s)]
*  for selling loose cigarettes? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1994.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1996.0s)]
*  What was that guy's name? Big heavy dude. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=1998.0s)]
*  I forgot his name. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2000.0s)]
*  It was a terrible story. Eric Garner. Terrible story. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2002.0s)]
*  But there was all these people that were saying that's not a chokehold. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2004.0s)]
*  And I was like, fuck you, that's not a chokehold. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2007.0s)]
*  Like, let me do that to you. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2009.0s)]
*  You don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2011.0s)]
*  That cop had that dude's head, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2013.0s)]
*  and he had that shit cinched down. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2015.0s)]
*  He's getting choked. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2018.0s)]
*  And that's the worst case of it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2020.0s)]
*  Amen. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2022.0s)]
*  But this is the best case of it, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2024.0s)]
*  stopping someone who's been assaulting people. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2026.0s)]
*  The fact that the guy died fucking sucks, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2028.0s)]
*  and we can't speak to it because I don't know. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2030.0s)]
*  I don't know. Is there a video of the actual choking? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2032.0s)]
*  If there's a video out there, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2035.0s)]
*  and not that you want to see the guy die, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2037.0s)]
*  but it's crucial to know [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2039.0s)]
*  whether he's guilty or not. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2041.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2043.0s)]
*  How long did the guy hold on to the choke? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2045.0s)]
*  Because if he did hold on to the choke for a couple of minutes, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2047.0s)]
*  you don't do that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2049.0s)]
*  Does he know that, though? [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2051.0s)]
*  There's another thing. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2053.0s)]
*  He might not know that. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2055.0s)]
*  Just because he's a Marine, he knows how to do that. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2057.0s)]
*  Fucking everybody knows. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2059.0s)]
*  Well, 100% he's choking him. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2061.0s)]
*  There's the photo, but now... [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2063.0s)]
*  Logan Paul in Aljamain, for sure. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2065.0s)]
*  Kind of shitty technique. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2067.0s)]
*  But look at his right arm. He's goofy with his hand. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2069.0s)]
*  So it's not good technique. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2071.0s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2073.0s)]
*  I saw the guy you interviewed. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2075.0s)]
*  He claimed this guy was talking through it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2077.0s)]
*  He said he used it more to restrain him, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2079.0s)]
*  but I guess that's what you would say. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2081.0s)]
*  That'll work. That's old-school UFC palm on the head. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2083.0s)]
*  It does work, but that's not like what a black belt does. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2085.0s)]
*  That's not a serious guy. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2087.0s)]
*  You know what kind of scared me recently? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2089.0s)]
*  Not to be a dick. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2091.0s)]
*  And I love Michael Bisping, and who else did it? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2093.0s)]
*  Marvin Vittori. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2095.0s)]
*  But fuck, man. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2097.0s)]
*  Guys, when you want to do the re-inventory... [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2099.0s)]
*  And I love Michael Bisping. I get along with him very well. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2101.0s)]
*  They put Steve-O in someone else's son-of-a-bitch. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2103.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, guys! [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2105.0s)]
*  Do a bit... [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2107.0s)]
*  Now, look, can I say something right now? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2109.0s)]
*  And... [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2111.0s)]
*  Do you mind if I do this to Dean Thomas? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2113.0s)]
*  Oh, wait a minute. I'm all right. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2115.0s)]
*  No, wait a minute. I'm all right. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2117.0s)]
*  No, no, I'm not saying exactly where you are. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2119.0s)]
*  But just when you're doing it, the prop are re-invading. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2121.0s)]
*  Already get elbows in the right spot. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2123.0s)]
*  I want the elbow underneath the point of the chin. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2125.0s)]
*  That way I know I'm on the crotch at arteries. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2127.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2129.0s)]
*  But now, if I just slightly go to compress... [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2131.0s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2133.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2135.0s)]
*  Like, I feel like if it's on the windpipe at all... [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2137.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're on the windpipe. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2139.0s)]
*  I'm looking at this thing like, guys, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2141.0s)]
*  you might crush his fucking throat. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2143.0s)]
*  And look at the amount of pressure he's putting all of his weight behind him. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2145.0s)]
*  Like, look what he's doing. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2149.0s)]
*  And he's still holding it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2151.0s)]
*  But his forearm was on his windpipe. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2153.0s)]
*  And, Mikey, I love Mikey. I love Mike. I do. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2155.0s)]
*  But, guys, come on, man. Fuck. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2157.0s)]
*  That's also, like... [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2159.0s)]
*  He, like, leaned into it. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2161.0s)]
*  I know. He got all of his weight behind it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2163.0s)]
*  That was... I would never do that to somebody. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2165.0s)]
*  That was out. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2167.0s)]
*  You want a V on the neck. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2169.0s)]
*  That's not a V. That's a fucking L. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2171.0s)]
*  That's a fucking... [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2173.0s)]
*  He's doing a number four on his neck. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2175.0s)]
*  Dude, it should be a V on the neck. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2177.0s)]
*  That didn't hurt you when I was doing it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2179.0s)]
*  And you'll be sleeping in under ten fucking seconds. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2181.0s)]
*  I don't like that. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2183.0s)]
*  So if you get a choke out radio DJs, do it properly. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2185.0s)]
*  Align your elbow with the chin. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2187.0s)]
*  There's a lot of those DJs get choked out. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2189.0s)]
*  I mean, goddamn. I don't know. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2191.0s)]
*  I was looking at it like, dude, how much jitsu? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2193.0s)]
*  What the fuck am I doing? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2195.0s)]
*  Like, guys, I mean, yeah, you'll put him out, but... [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2197.0s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2199.0s)]
*  You're gonna hurt him before you put him out. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2201.0s)]
*  He's not gonna be eating soup for a fucking week, that guy. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2203.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2205.0s)]
*  That just bothers me. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2207.0s)]
*  I hear you. It's a good thing to talk about. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2209.0s)]
*  Why do people want to get choked out like that, too? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2211.0s)]
*  Why do they want to go to sleep? [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2213.0s)]
*  They have this infatuation, like, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2215.0s)]
*  maybe we're fighters and just like, I want to see what it feels like. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2217.0s)]
*  Oh, you know what the worst one is? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2219.0s)]
*  Steve-O with Tim Kennedy. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2221.0s)]
*  Tim Kennedy choked him to sleep and then dropped him. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2223.0s)]
*  And he bounced off his fucking head on the theater floor. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2225.0s)]
*  But why would Tim... [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2229.0s)]
*  You think Tim Kennedy would know better than I do? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2231.0s)]
*  I don't think Tim Kennedy gives a fuck. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2233.0s)]
*  Tim Kennedy's a wild boy. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2235.0s)]
*  So look at this. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2237.0s)]
*  He chokes him to sleep. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2239.0s)]
*  But again, look at the elbow placement. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2241.0s)]
*  His feet are dangling. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2243.0s)]
*  Wait, what is he... [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2245.0s)]
*  See? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2247.0s)]
*  There's people watching. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2249.0s)]
*  Yeah, this was on his show. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2251.0s)]
*  I bet you he told him to fucking drop him. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2253.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he did tell him to drop him. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2255.0s)]
*  And he's like, okay. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2257.0s)]
*  I'll drop you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2259.0s)]
*  He's got his feet dangling. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2261.0s)]
*  First of all, the guy hits his head on the floor, too. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2263.0s)]
*  You could die. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2265.0s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. That part. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2267.0s)]
*  The choking out, his head worse happening. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2269.0s)]
*  Why would people do that? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2271.0s)]
*  He's crazy. He wants that to happen. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2273.0s)]
*  But why would Tim Kennedy put himself in that position? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2275.0s)]
*  Because if he dies, he's responsible for that. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2277.0s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2279.0s)]
*  That's why I don't choke nobody out like that. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2281.0s)]
*  That's a real thing in fights. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2283.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2285.0s)]
*  You could end a situation just as easy. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2287.0s)]
*  That fucking idiot when I was in Vegas. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2289.0s)]
*  Easy right hand at his fucking chin. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2291.0s)]
*  I was looking at him like the Robocop. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2293.0s)]
*  I saw the chin right there. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2295.0s)]
*  But then he's taking his shirt off. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2297.0s)]
*  I'm just like... [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2299.0s)]
*  Get out of here, you little fucker. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2301.0s)]
*  And my kids were right there. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2303.0s)]
*  I hit him, his head hits the floor. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2305.0s)]
*  I'm fucked. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2307.0s)]
*  My kids are going to be scarred. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2309.0s)]
*  The way you did it was kind of beautiful. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2311.0s)]
*  And he's laughing. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2313.0s)]
*  I mean it was beautiful. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2315.0s)]
*  It's great commercial for Jiu Jitsu. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2317.0s)]
*  I use that all the time as a fucking... [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2319.0s)]
*  I'm no salesman, but I tell people... [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2321.0s)]
*  And I mean it though. I really do mean it. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2323.0s)]
*  I don't point to any of my fights with [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2325.0s)]
*  the guys I fought. I fought some killers and stuff. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2327.0s)]
*  I tell people to look up that. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2329.0s)]
*  And it's not for bragging rights. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2331.0s)]
*  It's not... [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2333.0s)]
*  You're laughing. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2335.0s)]
*  You're laughing. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2337.0s)]
*  I'm fighting my evil stunt dog. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2339.0s)]
*  The stunt dog. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2341.0s)]
*  The time you're holding his wrist, it's like you're doing a seminar. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2343.0s)]
*  Oh no, 100% a lesson. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2345.0s)]
*  But you know what I really like though [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2347.0s)]
*  about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is... [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2349.0s)]
*  Well this is how it started though. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2351.0s)]
*  Because they came in weekend at Bernie's. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2353.0s)]
*  So he's putting glasses on her and shit. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2355.0s)]
*  So at first it was kind of funny. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2357.0s)]
*  I'm like, look at this, she's done. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2359.0s)]
*  She's done. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2361.0s)]
*  Look at her. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2363.0s)]
*  So you gotta understand... [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2365.0s)]
*  Where is this? Is this in Vegas? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2367.0s)]
*  This is at the Red Rock Casino. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2369.0s)]
*  The Fettino brothers own this. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2371.0s)]
*  And this is the weekend that you got inducted to the Hall of Fame, right? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2373.0s)]
*  Look at this guy throwing up his guard. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2375.0s)]
*  And right now he's... [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2377.0s)]
*  See what happened was... [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2379.0s)]
*  I'm with my wife and my kids. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2381.0s)]
*  It's July 4th. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2383.0s)]
*  Because the next day I was going into the Hall of Fame. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2385.0s)]
*  So... [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2387.0s)]
*  And this fat fuck... [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2389.0s)]
*  Oh you're just subduing him? Alright, get off him. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2391.0s)]
*  Yeah dude, are you gonna fucking control him? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2393.0s)]
*  At that point nothing happened. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2395.0s)]
*  I was waiting for this guy to grab my balls or something. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2397.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2399.0s)]
*  Because there's gonna be a lapse between me not controlling him [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2401.0s)]
*  and him not getting involved. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2403.0s)]
*  But the thing was... [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2405.0s)]
*  We were... [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2407.0s)]
*  The next day I was going into... [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2409.0s)]
*  Does he try to swing at you when he gets up? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2411.0s)]
*  No, now he's saying he wants to press charges. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2413.0s)]
*  So what happened was... [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2415.0s)]
*  What happened was... [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2417.0s)]
*  He was gonna charge you with embarrassing him. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2419.0s)]
*  It was the day before I was going to go into the Hall of Fame. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2421.0s)]
*  And my wife's like, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2423.0s)]
*  Oh we had family there in Vegas. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2425.0s)]
*  For me getting inducted in. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2427.0s)]
*  So she goes, Oh you wanna go down to the... [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2429.0s)]
*  To the strip. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2431.0s)]
*  To see the fireworks. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2433.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Listen man, there's a lot of drunks. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2435.0s)]
*  I don't wanna... Let's just keep it low key. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2437.0s)]
*  And then we'll celebrate tomorrow. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2439.0s)]
*  So sure enough, we're at the Red Rock Casino. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2441.0s)]
*  Which is so cool. I love that place. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2443.0s)]
*  Great place. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2445.0s)]
*  There's a bowling alley in there. There's a movie theater. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2447.0s)]
*  You know I love the movies. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2449.0s)]
*  And so me and my wife, my kids, and my sister. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2451.0s)]
*  And her kid were there. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2453.0s)]
*  So we're at the cafe. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2455.0s)]
*  And then you see them two walk in. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2457.0s)]
*  The guy and his girlfriend. They were really hammered. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2459.0s)]
*  They left. He left her there. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2461.0s)]
*  She slumped in the thing. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2463.0s)]
*  It's like passed out. Then he came back. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2465.0s)]
*  And he came back really hostile. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2467.0s)]
*  And he was like throwing shit at the fucking... [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2469.0s)]
*  The waiters. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2471.0s)]
*  And I go to my wife. I go, We gotta get the fuck out of here. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2473.0s)]
*  I go... [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2475.0s)]
*  Cause I just know it's gonna get... [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2477.0s)]
*  If something goes near my kids throwing it all at the rec. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2479.0s)]
*  I just know I gotta get out of here. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2481.0s)]
*  Cause it's not good. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2483.0s)]
*  Sure enough my waiter was bringing me my check. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2485.0s)]
*  And the guy got up. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2487.0s)]
*  He got up like this. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2489.0s)]
*  So instinctively I got up. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2491.0s)]
*  And then he turned right to me. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2493.0s)]
*  And this is what I tell my students. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2495.0s)]
*  Cause I don't look like a pussy. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2497.0s)]
*  I don't look like John Rallo. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2499.0s)]
*  John Rallo gets up. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2501.0s)]
*  This is not... [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2503.0s)]
*  So I don't look like a pussy. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2505.0s)]
*  Cause the guy looked at me and goes, You got a fucking problem? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2507.0s)]
*  And so I'm already angled. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2509.0s)]
*  I'm not gonna be on World Star Hip Hop. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2511.0s)]
*  I'm already angled. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2513.0s)]
*  So then he fucking... [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2515.0s)]
*  Takes that fucking shirt off. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2517.0s)]
*  And nothing's gonna get better after that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2519.0s)]
*  So I stepped in around the waist. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2521.0s)]
*  Put him down. The whole place is clapping at that point. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2523.0s)]
*  That's what you don't... [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2525.0s)]
*  And I tell my sister. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2527.0s)]
*  I go, Sammy, I go, Film this. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2529.0s)]
*  Cause I know what's gonna happen. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2531.0s)]
*  I know he's gonna say I'm a UFC guy beating him up. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2533.0s)]
*  So that's her. My sister filmed that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2535.0s)]
*  She's also the one with the big mouth. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2537.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. That's not my wife. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2539.0s)]
*  My wife's quiet. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2541.0s)]
*  So then, you know, I gave him a little lesson. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2543.0s)]
*  And then security ended up coming. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2545.0s)]
*  And at one point, you know, I'm telling him to calm down. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2547.0s)]
*  And I look up and I see my nine, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2549.0s)]
*  my Maria, my middle child. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2551.0s)]
*  At the time she was like nine. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2553.0s)]
*  And so she's looking up like, you know, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2555.0s)]
*  like a little like, uh, like, you know, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2557.0s)]
*  terrified kind of, you know. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2559.0s)]
*  So at one point I look up her with the same tone. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2561.0s)]
*  I go, Oh no, it's okay. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2563.0s)]
*  I'm talking to him. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2565.0s)]
*  So it sounds like I'm talking to him, but I was talking to my kid. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2567.0s)]
*  But, uh, you know, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2569.0s)]
*  afterwards with that, I sent a video [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2571.0s)]
*  to Dana and I go, Hey, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2573.0s)]
*  tell Lorenzo to get better security in his motherfucker. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2575.0s)]
*  So that's when he [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2577.0s)]
*  put it out there. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2579.0s)]
*  But I tell the students to look at that. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2581.0s)]
*  The guys that are coming in, if they're on [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2583.0s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu for them, I go, look, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2585.0s)]
*  it's first of all, it's nothing to brag about. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2587.0s)]
*  You all know this. It's a drunk white belt. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2589.0s)]
*  It's not like I'm fucking, Hey, look what I did. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2591.0s)]
*  I want some guys that did something. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2593.0s)]
*  But did it untrained eye. It's kind of cool. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2595.0s)]
*  You know, I think Jiu Jitsu is like a superpower. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2597.0s)]
*  It really is, man. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2599.0s)]
*  That is such a much [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2601.0s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2603.0s)]
*  I was going to say it's such a much better result than the Joe Schilling one. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2605.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2607.0s)]
*  Let's show that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2609.0s)]
*  This is [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2611.0s)]
*  worst case scenario. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2613.0s)]
*  This is the other end of the spectrum. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2615.0s)]
*  You could use Jiu Jitsu, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2617.0s)]
*  or you could use Muay Thai in Western boxing. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2619.0s)]
*  So here we're talking, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2621.0s)]
*  but this is one of the beautiful things about Jiu Jitsu. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2623.0s)]
*  We're talking from the perspective of a [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2625.0s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu champion, UFC champion, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2627.0s)]
*  and a Muay Thai champion. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2629.0s)]
*  And watch how Joe Schilling handles this, dude. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2631.0s)]
*  Because this is one of the most horrific videos [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2633.0s)]
*  that any drunk douchebag should ever see. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2635.0s)]
*  This should be, they should show you in [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2637.0s)]
*  drunk douchebag school. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2639.0s)]
*  Like this can happen to you. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2641.0s)]
*  So he bumps into him, and then the guy says, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2643.0s)]
*  Hey. And Joe Schilling [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2645.0s)]
*  turns around and the guy fucking [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2647.0s)]
*  All he had to do, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2649.0s)]
*  all that dude had to do [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2651.0s)]
*  was flinch at him, and Joe [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2653.0s)]
*  hit the switch. And you know, this is crazy. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2655.0s)]
*  This guy just looks like a yuppie douchebag. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2657.0s)]
*  Well apparently that guy had been like, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2659.0s)]
*  he had been annoying everybody at the bar. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2661.0s)]
*  He looks like a dick. Look at this. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2663.0s)]
*  You know what I'm [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2665.0s)]
*  happy about? I heard [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2667.0s)]
*  he got off okay. I heard he got off. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2669.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got off. It's a stand your ground law. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2671.0s)]
*  Stand your ground law. Because it happened in Florida. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2673.0s)]
*  God bless Florida. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2675.0s)]
*  That's fucking crazy. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2677.0s)]
*  Bro, that's the last stop. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2679.0s)]
*  If I move to Florida, the fucking empire [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2681.0s)]
*  is on the way out. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2683.0s)]
*  But I moved to Florida. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2685.0s)]
*  Joe Schilling is a savage. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2687.0s)]
*  He's so quiet, but man [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2689.0s)]
*  that guy was switch or turn in a minute. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2691.0s)]
*  Well, you know what? He's a [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2693.0s)]
*  great guy. Yeah, he's a nice guy. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2695.0s)]
*  He's the best guy you could ever be friends with. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2697.0s)]
*  But that's the wrong [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2699.0s)]
*  dude to flinch on. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2701.0s)]
*  Oh my God. That's the way it [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2703.0s)]
*  should be though. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2705.0s)]
*  I think most fighters are that way. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2707.0s)]
*  Yeah, most fighters aren't like that. That was totally unnecessary. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2709.0s)]
*  That guy did not have to do that to him. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2711.0s)]
*  The whole thing was provoked. He's a dick. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2713.0s)]
*  Yeah. He deserved it. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2715.0s)]
*  Yeah, he deserved it. He learned a lesson. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2717.0s)]
*  That's the universe. And those are videos [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2719.0s)]
*  for everybody to see too. Kids should [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2721.0s)]
*  see that and go, oh yeah. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2723.0s)]
*  It's Darwinism. You know what I'm saying? When you [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2725.0s)]
*  an asshole like that, you dumb, you get [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2727.0s)]
*  knocked out. Right, or you get eaten. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2729.0s)]
*  Back in the day, that's how it was. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2731.0s)]
*  If you talk shit, you got hit. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2733.0s)]
*  You suffered consequences. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2735.0s)]
*  Now there are no consequences. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2737.0s)]
*  That's why I got off Twitter. I haven't been on Twitter [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2739.0s)]
*  in eight, my life is better. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2741.0s)]
*  It's better. I don't even know what goes on there. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2743.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I'm in my world. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2745.0s)]
*  I do the Instagram because I like to spread positivity [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2747.0s)]
*  and I like to do stuff like that [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2749.0s)]
*  with my schools and stuff. But the Twitter [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2751.0s)]
*  thing, I don't get it. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2753.0s)]
*  I get it if there's some important [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2755.0s)]
*  message that you want out there for people [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2757.0s)]
*  that can't get it out there. I get that. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2759.0s)]
*  But otherwise, I would [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2761.0s)]
*  just see negativity. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2763.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm too sensitive. I didn't like it. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2765.0s)]
*  I didn't fucking like it. I want to be like [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2767.0s)]

*  people just to talk shit without any kind of repercussions. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2777.0s)]
*  It's also [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2779.0s)]
*  you're just dealing with too much negativity. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2781.0s)]

*  It's not good for you. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2785.0s)]
*  Negativity should be treated like a [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2787.0s)]
*  fucking cancer. And I do that at my school. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2789.0s)]

*  how I said I don't have to go to the city anymore. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2809.0s)]
*  I used to have two schools. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2811.0s)]
*  I lost the school from the pandemic. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2813.0s)]
*  Fucking awesome. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2815.0s)]

*  Maybe some voice over shit. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2849.0s)]

*  You're telling me you got a great balance. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2853.0s)]
*  That's what you want out of life. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2855.0s)]
*  You want a great balance. Shit you like to do. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2857.0s)]
*  I heard on here one time [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2859.0s)]
*  I like that Jordan Peterson. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2861.0s)]
*  I never talked to him. He's awesome. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2863.0s)]
*  When you say, when you talk to smart people, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2865.0s)]
*  it's like talking to an ape. I be whatever's beneath an ape. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2867.0s)]
*  So I'm not doing it. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2869.0s)]
*  If you're talking to him, you feel you're an ape. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2871.0s)]
*  But I love his shit. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2873.0s)]
*  I love what he says. I remember he was on here [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2875.0s)]
*  once talking about how, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2877.0s)]
*  and I'm going to paraphrase for sure, but [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2879.0s)]
*  retirement is like a, there's like really [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2881.0s)]
*  not that there's no such thing, but [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2883.0s)]
*  what is your idea of retirement? He said like the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2885.0s)]
*  thing with drinking a margarita is like a [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2887.0s)]
*  that's a postcard, a postcard [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2889.0s)]
*  that's not a retirement. It's not a real trend. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2891.0s)]
*  It's not a strategy for your life. Exactly. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2893.0s)]
*  I've heard people that like, I just can't wait [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2895.0s)]
*  to retire. Can't wait to retire. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2897.0s)]
*  Then they retire. I don't know what the fuck to do with myself. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2899.0s)]
*  And then they end up fucking dying. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2901.0s)]
*  So I think quality of life, and I think [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2903.0s)]
*  I learned a lot of this from Ray Longo, who's [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2905.0s)]
*  65 and still fucking going. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2907.0s)]
*  Quality of life is [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2909.0s)]
*  to me the most important thing. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2911.0s)]
*  Like you know what I mean? How you move. I agree. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2913.0s)]
*  It's everything. We've experienced enough [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2915.0s)]
*  douchebags in our life. We've experienced enough [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2917.0s)]
*  shitty times. Yeah! [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2919.0s)]
*  Now you just want to hang around good people [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2921.0s)]
*  and just chill out. Have a good time. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2923.0s)]
*  I was telling Matt earlier that [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2925.0s)]
*  the Republican party in Maryland [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2927.0s)]
*  actually asked me if I would run for the US Senate seat. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2929.0s)]
*  John Rollo for president. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2931.0s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2933.0s)]
*  John Rollo. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2935.0s)]
*  The most jacked president in the history of the universe. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2937.0s)]

*  BJ got Hawaii lockdown. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2941.0s)]
*  That's what I want the rest of the world to see when they think [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2943.0s)]
*  about an American president. A John Rollo [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2945.0s)]
*  looking motherfucker. Hell yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2947.0s)]
*  Who's pinned on the gavel. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2949.0s)]
*  But I said the same thing. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2951.0s)]
*  It's going to ruin your fucking life. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2953.0s)]
*  They're going to be up your ass with a microscope. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2955.0s)]
*  They're going to torture your family in the media. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2957.0s)]
*  And I said to Matt, I go, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2959.0s)]
*  I enjoy my life the way it is right now. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2961.0s)]
*  I said it's comfortable. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2963.0s)]
*  I'm happy. I'm my own boss. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2965.0s)]
*  We all thank Henzel because he's [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2967.0s)]
*  given us all a nice career [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2969.0s)]

*  Thank God for Henzel. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2973.0s)]
*  Henzel's the best. He's the best. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2975.0s)]
*  What a fucking guy he is. What a lineage that guy's created. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2977.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2979.0s)]
*  He's changed a lot of lives. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2981.0s)]
*  In that Gracie documentary that I was just doing, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2983.0s)]
*  I got a few black belts where someone says, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2985.0s)]
*  I got a black belt under Hickson. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2987.0s)]
*  I got a black belt under Henzel. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2989.0s)]
*  That's a big fucking deal. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2991.0s)]
*  It's like one of those, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2993.0s)]
*  that's like graduating from Yale. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2995.0s)]
*  That's the real deal. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2997.0s)]
*  No, I mean that's the proudest, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=2999.0s)]
*  I'm Henzel's first American. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3001.0s)]
*  You can say Ricardo Almeida technically is. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3003.0s)]
*  But fuck that. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3005.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3007.0s)]
*  You've been in Assa√≠s since you're three years old. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3009.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3011.0s)]
*  He moved over. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3013.0s)]
*  He went to Brazil when he was like two months. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3015.0s)]
*  I will claim to be the first American. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3017.0s)]
*  But Henzel, when he came over, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3019.0s)]
*  he was just so giving, man. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3021.0s)]
*  He brought me over. I was cornering him [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3023.0s)]
*  in the rings tournament and Pride [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3025.0s)]
*  and these things when I was a purple belt. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3027.0s)]
*  I didn't make a name for myself yet. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3029.0s)]
*  He really just did so much for so many. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3031.0s)]
*  I remember when Jordan Lombo's first day. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3033.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3035.0s)]
*  The thing about Henzel is he's so different [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3037.0s)]
*  from the traditional Brazilian black belt. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3039.0s)]
*  Because like you said, he's so giving [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3041.0s)]
*  and it's like tradition don't matter to him. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3043.0s)]
*  When they would talk about, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3045.0s)]
*  oh, you've got to have your belt tied this way. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3047.0s)]
*  And he said, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3049.0s)]
*  the belt is whatever the way it ends up, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3051.0s)]
*  that's the way I tie it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3053.0s)]
*  Whatever it ends up, that's how it's supposed to be tied. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3055.0s)]
*  He's the man. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3057.0s)]
*  Universally loved. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3059.0s)]
*  Everyone loves Henzel. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3061.0s)]
*  And he's funny too because [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3063.0s)]
*  now I remember there was [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3065.0s)]
*  a modern Jiu-Jitsu student [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3067.0s)]
*  who was in the blue basement. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3069.0s)]
*  And Henzel was teaching there one night and he goes, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3071.0s)]
*  Henzel, when he was naming all the, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3073.0s)]
*  when you go from the coyote guard to the [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3075.0s)]
*  K guard, he goes, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3077.0s)]
*  and Henzel goes, my friend, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3079.0s)]
*  don't make Jiu-Jitsu only for the intellectuals. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3081.0s)]
*  Show me the move. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3083.0s)]
*  And I'm there with it, man. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3085.0s)]
*  I'm right there with you. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3087.0s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3089.0s)]
*  Bro, I listened to some of the commentary. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3091.0s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what they're saying sometimes. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3093.0s)]
*  Oh man, I can't, yeah. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3095.0s)]
*  It makes it weird when they start going, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3097.0s)]
*  oh, you don't know the coyote guard? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3099.0s)]
*  I go, dude, man, motherfucker. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3101.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean the underhook when you're getting out with, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3103.0s)]
*  been doing that since the last millennium, cocksucker. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3105.0s)]
*  They feel like they're teaching you because they know the words. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3107.0s)]
*  But it's weird. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3109.0s)]
*  There's some shit like De La Hiva. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3111.0s)]
*  You have to understand that. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3115.0s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3117.0s)]
*  And I'm not hating on anything new. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3119.0s)]
*  I love it all. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3121.0s)]
*  But it could get confusing. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3123.0s)]
*  It gets confusing. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3125.0s)]
*  The leg lock game is confusing as fuck. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3127.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3129.0s)]
*  When I was training, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3131.0s)]
*  there was no leg locks. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3133.0s)]
*  It was very rare. It was every now and then some dude [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3135.0s)]
*  learned some shit from Dean Lister. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3137.0s)]
*  It was frowned upon. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3139.0s)]
*  Foot locks were okay, though. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3141.0s)]
*  Everybody got figure four foot locks. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3143.0s)]
*  A knee bar, straight knee bar was okay. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3145.0s)]
*  Occasionally a knee bar, but heel hooks were dangerous. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3147.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3149.0s)]
*  But then, goddamn, the whole game changed. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3151.0s)]
*  Danneher, John Danneher, my good buddy, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3153.0s)]
*  that conversation he had with Dean Lister, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3155.0s)]
*  Dean Lister was sleeping on my futon when he had that fucking... [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3157.0s)]
*  Dean Lister was visiting, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3159.0s)]
*  staying at my place, training with me. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3161.0s)]
*  I was living with Rodrigo Gracie at the time [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3163.0s)]
*  in Woodmere, Long Island. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3165.0s)]
*  We had an apartment. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3167.0s)]
*  It was fucking awesome. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3169.0s)]
*  And Dean Lister was visiting. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3171.0s)]
*  And that's when I would take him in. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3173.0s)]
*  And he was taking out most of the academy [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3175.0s)]
*  with the leg locks back then. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3177.0s)]
*  And that's what I was doing. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3179.0s)]
*  And that's when he had that conversation with John [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3181.0s)]
*  about why ignore 50% of the body. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3183.0s)]
*  And then John starts fucking twitching. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3187.0s)]
*  And then computers start running in the circuit. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3189.0s)]
*  Changes the entire trajectory. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3191.0s)]
*  I mean, he really did. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3193.0s)]
*  That guy is someone right out of a fucking movie. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3195.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3197.0s)]
*  Danneher, that would not be a real person. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3199.0s)]
*  And any other time in history [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3201.0s)]
*  do you get a guy who's a professor of philosophy [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3203.0s)]
*  at Columbia [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3205.0s)]
*  who becomes addicted to jujitsu [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3207.0s)]
*  and sleeps on the mats and just teaches people [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3209.0s)]
*  and he's like a legit genius [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3211.0s)]
*  wears rash guards everywhere. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3213.0s)]
*  Doesn't give a fuck about anything but jujitsu. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3215.0s)]
*  Had one on at dinner last night. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3217.0s)]
*  He had one on my wedding. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3219.0s)]
*  Came to my wedding in a rash guard. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3221.0s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3223.0s)]
*  And he's so fucking smart, man. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3225.0s)]
*  All he gives a fuck about is combat sports. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3227.0s)]
*  Well, we just talked about it yesterday. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3229.0s)]
*  We were out to eat yesterday. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3231.0s)]
*  And I'm like, Johnny, give me a day in the life. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3233.0s)]
*  And he's telling me about all the teaching. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3235.0s)]
*  And so maybe he lightened up his load. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3237.0s)]
*  Because back in the day, in HENZO's [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3239.0s)]
*  he would teach, teach, teach, and you'd see him [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3241.0s)]
*  on a pillow. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3243.0s)]
*  And then he'd get back up, do some more privates. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3245.0s)]
*  I know from being a teacher [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3249.0s)]
*  you could get fucking burnt the fuck out. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3251.0s)]
*  I don't know how he does that. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3253.0s)]
*  It's just how. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3255.0s)]
*  He doesn't do anything else. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3257.0s)]
*  His first television that he had [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3259.0s)]
*  my buddy Chad LeBrun [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3261.0s)]
*  you might know Chad. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3263.0s)]
*  He was a, we called him Hillbilly. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3265.0s)]
*  He was from Virginia. He came down to stay [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3267.0s)]
*  for a little bit in New York to train with us. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3269.0s)]
*  Couldn't take it. He goes, oh, I was in the [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3271.0s)]
*  supermarket. I said, thanks, ma'am. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3273.0s)]
*  She goes, I'm not older than you. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3275.0s)]
*  He goes, oh, oh. Anyway, he just didn't like the whole [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3277.0s)]
*  New York attitude. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3279.0s)]
*  So he goes, I gave John my TV [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3281.0s)]
*  because he, the only reason he [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3283.0s)]
*  took it is because he could play the [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3285.0s)]
*  it had a VHS [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3287.0s)]
*  and a DVD thing or whatever [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3289.0s)]
*  that he could watch wrestling videos on [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3291.0s)]
*  and shit like that. That's all he'd watch. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3293.0s)]
*  He doesn't watch anything else. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3295.0s)]
*  He doesn't believe in any kind of like [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3297.0s)]
*  any marriage or [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3299.0s)]
*  love. He's a fucking, he's an odd [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3301.0s)]
*  duck. He's a cyborg. I mean, I [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3303.0s)]
*  know. He's the oddest duck I've ever encountered. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3305.0s)]
*  And he's always been that way. He's as smart as anybody [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3307.0s)]
*  I've ever talked to. He's as smart as [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3309.0s)]
*  Elon. He's as smart as all these people. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3311.0s)]
*  He's just smart about killing people. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3313.0s)]
*  This guy just got his driver's license. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3315.0s)]
*  He's 50 and what? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3317.0s)]
*  He drives in Austin. Austin [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3319.0s)]
*  drives me to drive. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3321.0s)]
*  And he will end up back in New York [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3325.0s)]
*  sooner or later. No, no, we got him. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3327.0s)]
*  We got him out here. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3329.0s)]
*  I can't picture him. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3331.0s)]
*  It's weird seeing him anywhere other than [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3333.0s)]
*  New York. He's thriving out here though. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3335.0s)]
*  No, I know, listen. Do you know he's [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3337.0s)]
*  Gary Tonan's striking coach too? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3339.0s)]
*  Is he really? Isn't that wise? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3341.0s)]
*  I mean, I believe it. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3343.0s)]
*  If you study the game, I mean, it just [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3345.0s)]
*  comes down to information and knowledge. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3347.0s)]
*  I would very rarely [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3349.0s)]
*  say that I would trust [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3351.0s)]
*  someone who's never [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3353.0s)]
*  struck, like never been a striker [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3355.0s)]
*  to be a striking coach except for him. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3357.0s)]
*  Except for him. For him I'm like, yeah, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3359.0s)]
*  he'll figure it out. He'll probably be the best at it. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3361.0s)]
*  I like Gary. I wish Gary [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3363.0s)]
*  was in the UFC so more people could see him in. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3365.0s)]
*  He's got an exciting, exciting [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3367.0s)]
*  jujitsu game. He's a fucking best here. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3369.0s)]
*  He's a risk taker. Yeah, he's a risk taker for sure. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3371.0s)]
*  And sometimes it'll cost him. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3373.0s)]
*  That match with Kroon was one of my favorites. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3375.0s)]
*  Oh my god. That was insane. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3377.0s)]
*  That was insane. It showed how good Kroon [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3379.0s)]
*  is too. To come back from that [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3381.0s)]
*  and win. I feel for Kroon in that last one. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3383.0s)]
*  The last one was not good. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3385.0s)]
*  That was so crazy. I don't know [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3387.0s)]
*  what was going on. You know, you'd [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3389.0s)]
*  have to talk to Kroon and respectfully. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3391.0s)]
*  He looked depressed going in [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3393.0s)]
*  and throughout the fight just looking like he didn't want to be [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3395.0s)]
*  there. I'm not laughing at that. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3397.0s)]
*  Might as well tell you. Listen, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3399.0s)]
*  I was telling you guys this the other [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3401.0s)]
*  day. So [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3403.0s)]
*  I got ulcerative colitis. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3405.0s)]
*  It has to do with this. It shows like really? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3407.0s)]
*  What the fuck? What is that? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3409.0s)]
*  Oh, I have stomach issues, man. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3411.0s)]
*  I got fucking. When I have to go, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3413.0s)]
*  I have to go. And then you don't know when it stops. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3415.0s)]
*  It's a problem. So I'm at [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3417.0s)]
*  the UFC. Aljo's [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3419.0s)]
*  when Kroon fought. Did Aljo fight [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3421.0s)]
*  that night or Marab? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3423.0s)]
*  Was that Marab? I can't remember. I was there. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3425.0s)]
*  It was one of them. But I was there. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3427.0s)]
*  I think it was Aljo. Aljo [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3429.0s)]
*  was fighting that night. That's right. So [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3431.0s)]
*  I'm in. I asked the UFC [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3433.0s)]
*  to find me a stall a little bit [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3435.0s)]
*  private because I got stomach [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3437.0s)]
*  issues. So they brought me next to another [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3439.0s)]
*  one that wasn't so open. And it was [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3441.0s)]
*  through the showers and stuff. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3443.0s)]
*  So I'm in there doing my business. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3445.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden I hear [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3447.0s)]
*  some people by the fucking showers. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3449.0s)]
*  And it was Kroon and his whole crew. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3451.0s)]
*  And it was right after the loss, right? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3453.0s)]
*  Oh no. So I'm in the. They don't know I'm [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3455.0s)]
*  in there. Jesus. So I'm like, oh no. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3457.0s)]
*  I'm trying to stop my feet. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3459.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm clenching my ass. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3461.0s)]
*  And I'm like, and he's awesome. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3463.0s)]
*  I hear, I hear [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3465.0s)]
*  you know, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3467.0s)]
*  you know, they wanted me to use my jujitsu. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3469.0s)]
*  I tried to use my jujitsu. That fight [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3471.0s)]
*  sucked. And he's like stressing. He's like venting [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3473.0s)]
*  to his team. You know, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3475.0s)]
*  nothing. There's nothing crazy. But [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3477.0s)]
*  it's normal if there are losses to be. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3479.0s)]
*  And the team's being quiet. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3481.0s)]
*  All I know is I'm stuck in the fucking [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3483.0s)]
*  stall. I want [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3485.0s)]
*  to sneak out. The door is there. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3487.0s)]
*  I could make it, but they're going to see me. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3489.0s)]
*  The sink is over. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3491.0s)]
*  I got to wash my hands. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3493.0s)]
*  Did you ever think about saying, hey guys, it's Matt, Sarah. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3495.0s)]
*  I'm taking a shit. I didn't know what to [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3497.0s)]
*  know. I didn't know what to say. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3499.0s)]
*  Because they were trying to consult. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3501.0s)]
*  They weren't really saying much. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3503.0s)]
*  I would have knew somebody was in there. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3505.0s)]
*  I was finishing up. I was almost out. I was trying to stop my feet. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3507.0s)]
*  So I finished [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3509.0s)]
*  and I walk out. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3511.0s)]
*  I go over. I wash my hands. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3513.0s)]
*  And he looks up and goes, what's up, Sarah? [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3515.0s)]
*  I go, hey, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3517.0s)]
*  Crone. You don't know what to say. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3519.0s)]
*  And I've been there, obviously. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3521.0s)]
*  I got my losses. So I go, hey, man. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3523.0s)]
*  I go, look, man, to be honest, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3525.0s)]
*  you're going to feel like this until you kick someone else's ass. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3527.0s)]
*  I go, that's [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3529.0s)]
*  going to help you. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3531.0s)]
*  Bye! [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3533.0s)]
*  Dude, I just wanted to fucking [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3537.0s)]
*  put a lampshade in there. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3539.0s)]
*  Oh my god, that's hilarious. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3541.0s)]
*  What a scenario. I want to see [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3543.0s)]
*  that in a cartoon. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3545.0s)]
*  I had to make that. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3547.0s)]
*  My ass gets me in trouble. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3549.0s)]
*  Matt, the [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3551.0s)]
*  colitis thing, what do you do for that? [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3553.0s)]
*  Well, I just went [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3555.0s)]
*  and saw a specialist. I had [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3557.0s)]
*  three colonoscopies. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3559.0s)]
*  And it's one thing. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3561.0s)]
*  They don't even tell me to stay away from a food. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3563.0s)]
*  I'm like, so I can just eat anything? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3565.0s)]
*  I'm even asking my wife, because I'm a little druggie. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3567.0s)]
*  You have to be in fucking put out and [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3569.0s)]
*  them exploring my ass. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3571.0s)]
*  So I'm like, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3573.0s)]
*  do I have to stay away from anything? They're not telling me [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3575.0s)]
*  nothing. No, just no. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3577.0s)]
*  Have you ever tried [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3579.0s)]
*  to adjust your diet? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3581.0s)]
*  Have you ever tried to do like carnivore? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3583.0s)]
*  Have you tried to do that? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3585.0s)]
*  You know what I did, what I did for a while, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3587.0s)]
*  and I believe it helped me initially [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3589.0s)]
*  with my weight, because like I said, I used to be a fatty. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3591.0s)]
*  I did the [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3593.0s)]
*  gluten free for a while. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3595.0s)]
*  For a while. Did the colitis [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3597.0s)]
*  help? Did it get better? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3599.0s)]
*  You know what it was? I ended up having to get like [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3601.0s)]
*  hospitalized with my stomach, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3603.0s)]
*  because I was having extreme flare ups at one point. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3605.0s)]
*  And I didn't know what was going on. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3607.0s)]
*  So I went in there and they put me in an IV. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3609.0s)]
*  And I was just on liquids [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3611.0s)]
*  until it calmed down. And then [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3613.0s)]
*  the last [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3615.0s)]
*  so then after that I [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3617.0s)]
*  started doing gluten free, because I didn't want to eat anything [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3619.0s)]
*  that I remembered that was flaring it up. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3621.0s)]
*  And that was like Italian food and stuff. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3623.0s)]
*  But I was eating still Italian food, but the gluten free one. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3625.0s)]
*  Gluten free ravioli. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3627.0s)]
*  So this is some good shit. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3629.0s)]
*  And I lost a bunch of weight. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3631.0s)]
*  I feel the gluten free [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3633.0s)]
*  helped me out a lot, because I wasn't [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3635.0s)]
*  getting bloated anymore. I noticed. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3637.0s)]
*  It's a big problem with me too. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3639.0s)]
*  Cauliflower pizza and stuff like that. I wasn't getting bloated. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3641.0s)]
*  Now I don't think I'm getting bloated, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3643.0s)]
*  because I don't think I'm holding shit in. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3645.0s)]
*  I'm just having the shit. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3647.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's where it was [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3649.0s)]
*  with that. And then [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3651.0s)]
*  the last time I went, which was literally a couple [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3653.0s)]
*  weeks ago, they gave me something which I [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3655.0s)]
*  didn't do last time, like a bad boy. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3657.0s)]
*  I got to do a stool sample. I hate that. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3659.0s)]
*  You got to take a shit in a bucket. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3661.0s)]
*  But then it's like Mission Impossible. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3663.0s)]
*  You have 24 hours to get that shit. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3665.0s)]
*  So I'm going to be like [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3667.0s)]

*  She goes, you forget something last night? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3691.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3693.0s)]
*  You left the hose in the pool. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3695.0s)]
*  I always forget. I had to [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3697.0s)]
*  fill up the pool a little bit. My ADD [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3699.0s)]
*  I smoke a lot of reflux. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3701.0s)]
*  My ADD is pretty bad. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3703.0s)]
*  It's pretty bad, dude. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3705.0s)]
*  I'll be teaching a move. Not to get [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3707.0s)]
*  you guys worried, because I'm usually [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3709.0s)]
*  in that state anyway. I'll teach a move and I'll [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3711.0s)]
*  go into something and then I'll go back [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3713.0s)]

*  puts me back where I was. I forgot where I was. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3717.0s)]
*  And I'll look at my [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3719.0s)]

*  Alright, we're back to Mount. I don't know. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3723.0s)]
*  Matt, have you ever gone and got like [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3725.0s)]
*  blood work done and got everything checked [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3727.0s)]
*  out or like a reputable place that [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3729.0s)]
*  looks at all your levels and finds out what's going [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3731.0s)]
*  on? I mean, I got my TRT doc [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3733.0s)]
*  that I go every six weeks. I get my [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3735.0s)]
*  everything checked for me. All my levels would [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3737.0s)]
*  you might have food allergies, man. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3739.0s)]
*  You might be. It's the way you're talking [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3741.0s)]
*  about the gluten and the pasta. It's like [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3743.0s)]
*  there's a lot of people that react like that. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3745.0s)]
*  You know, no one actually gave me great advice. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3747.0s)]
*  Or who had said, he told me [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3749.0s)]
*  something very similar. I was just in Manchester, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3751.0s)]
*  England with George St. Pierre. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3753.0s)]
*  And we were doing like a [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3755.0s)]
*  signing out there. He got me hooked up with it. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3757.0s)]
*  He's such a sweetheart, George. And he told [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3759.0s)]
*  me that he had ulcerative colitis. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3761.0s)]
*  The same as me. And the stuff he was telling [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3763.0s)]
*  me is the same shit [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3765.0s)]
*  I deal with. And I'm like, fuck, that's [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3767.0s)]
*  right. I see blood also. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3769.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is gross. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3771.0s)]
*  So he was fucking [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3773.0s)]
*  So we were talking about it. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3775.0s)]
*  And he said that he [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3777.0s)]
*  what he does is the intimate fasting. So now [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3779.0s)]
*  he eats only between one [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3781.0s)]
*  and nine. He only eats between [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3783.0s)]
*  one p.m. and nine. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3785.0s)]
*  And that's his window of eating. And he [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3787.0s)]
*  feels great. He went away. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3789.0s)]
*  So I'm not doing that shit [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3791.0s)]
*  yet. But I might try that. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3793.0s)]
*  He does long fasts. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3795.0s)]
*  He's having multiple [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3797.0s)]
*  I think 72 hours. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3799.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. This day he said he does just the water. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3801.0s)]
*  He said he does that. He did that [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3803.0s)]
*  to kickstart it. But now he [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3805.0s)]
*  stays on that schedule. A lot of people swear by [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3807.0s)]
*  that every now and again. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3809.0s)]
*  I mean, you know what it is? Because of my stomach, I do [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3811.0s)]
*  eat less. Like I'll have [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3813.0s)]
*  two slices and a [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3815.0s)]
*  hero instead of like a pie. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3817.0s)]
*  Is that fair? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3819.0s)]
*  That might be the worst fucking [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3821.0s)]
*  I think you know how you can [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3823.0s)]
*  overtrain your body. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3825.0s)]
*  I think you can overuse [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3827.0s)]
*  your digestive system. You know, if you're a [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3829.0s)]
*  guy like me or you're like [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3831.0s)]
*  I have a real problem. If I come [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3833.0s)]
*  home and I'm tired, I just fucking eat. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3835.0s)]
*  I just open up that fridge. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3837.0s)]
*  Is that why you moved here for real? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3839.0s)]
*  Or did you keep your diet in check? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3841.0s)]
*  You want to be wasting all the good Italian food? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3843.0s)]
*  If I was in Austin too, I wouldn't be dialing [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3845.0s)]
*  fucking pizza every day. Dude, the two brothers [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3847.0s)]
*  and the stuff near me, the Umberto's, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3849.0s)]
*  they can't make a bad slice. It's fucking [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3851.0s)]
*  ridiculous. There's great food out here. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3853.0s)]
*  I'm not eating pizza so I don't know, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3855.0s)]
*  but there's great food out here. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3857.0s)]
*  Everywhere you go, there's like these different restaurants [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3859.0s)]
*  and food trucks and everything. I'll take you guys somewhere fun [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3861.0s)]
*  tonight. We'll go eat somewhere. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3863.0s)]
*  I know it is also [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3865.0s)]
*  I think why I'm staying in better shape is [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3867.0s)]
*  I used to always blow up [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3869.0s)]
*  as you know, like [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3871.0s)]
*  because I knew I'd be getting it off because I had a fight coming up. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3873.0s)]
*  So it's like, if I'm fighting [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3875.0s)]
*  twice a year, half the year I'm training. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3877.0s)]
*  So yeah, I'll become a fatty in between. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3879.0s)]
*  I mean, fucking [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3881.0s)]
*  Dana used to always say the same joke [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3883.0s)]
*  and he always has all his like, you know, like the [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3885.0s)]
*  evil villain says something and all the other guys, the henchmen are like [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3887.0s)]
*  so he used to always see me [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3889.0s)]
*  he used to always see me and he goes, oh [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3891.0s)]
*  it looks like you ate Matt Surra. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3893.0s)]
*  They go, ahhh. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3895.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck you Dana. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3897.0s)]
*  The same joke. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3899.0s)]
*  I mean, I love the little fucking guys [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3901.0s)]
*  laughing. But [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3903.0s)]
*  anyway, so then, so now [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3905.0s)]
*  I knew because I don't have anything coming up [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3907.0s)]
*  like four days a week [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3909.0s)]
*  like 7am, I do that [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3911.0s)]
*  7am class, so I start the day sweating [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3913.0s)]
*  even when I'm not rolling [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3915.0s)]
*  I'm fucking trapsying, doing [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3917.0s)]

*  Your dad's a fireplug. Yeah. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3927.0s)]
*  When I first met his father, I thought it was his brother. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3929.0s)]
*  We were at Henzo's, wrestle off [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3931.0s)]
*  for obby-dobby stuff and I said to Matt [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3933.0s)]
*  I go, has that another brother? He goes, brother. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3935.0s)]

*  He had me at 19. He's pretty young. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3939.0s)]
*  He had me young. Yeah, yeah. I was the [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3941.0s)]
*  best mistake he ever had. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3943.0s)]

*  Yeah, shit man. He has no neck either. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3961.0s)]
*  The north-south choke. We used to [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3963.0s)]
*  call the north-south choke the papa choke. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3965.0s)]
*  That's nice. Because Henzo, you know, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3967.0s)]
*  used to call him papa. And he [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3969.0s)]
*  used to get north-south and he had no fucking [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3971.0s)]
*  chest. His chest was like a barrel. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3973.0s)]
*  He used to get fucking that. Who was the first guy [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3975.0s)]
*  to start doing that? Because we used to think that was like a [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3977.0s)]
*  good move. The north-south choke? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3979.0s)]
*  At Henzo's was my dad. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3981.0s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. When [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3983.0s)]
*  I was a blue belt, after [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3985.0s)]
*  Frank beat Tito, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3987.0s)]
*  I went to train with him. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3989.0s)]
*  I asked Henzo, you care if I go see what's [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3991.0s)]
*  up? Because I wanted to learn what he was doing for cardio. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3993.0s)]
*  And he [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3995.0s)]
*  showed me a north-south choke. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3997.0s)]
*  He called it like a peck choke. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=3999.0s)]
*  And when I showed [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4001.0s)]
*  Henzo the move, like, you know, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4003.0s)]
*  Henzo was intrigued [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4005.0s)]
*  with it. And then he came up. He's got a whole [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4007.0s)]
*  chain of things off of [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4009.0s)]
*  if the guy turns this way, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4011.0s)]
*  lock him up. If he turns the other way, he's punch [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4013.0s)]
*  choking him. Like, it was pretty slick. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4015.0s)]
*  But, I mean, that was the first time [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4017.0s)]
*  I had seen it. But, so it used [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4019.0s)]
*  to, at one point in time, I remember Monson got [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4021.0s)]
*  somebody. That's what I was going to say. Jeff Monson was like [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4023.0s)]
*  known for it. Because he put what? I think he [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4025.0s)]
*  put Brandon Lee Hinkle out with it if I'm not [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4027.0s)]
*  who did he put out with that? Monson was a [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4029.0s)]
*  goon. He was [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4031.0s)]
*  so strong. He is a goon. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4033.0s)]
*  But, I mean, he'd get a whole, I mean, in that, in the best [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4035.0s)]
*  possible term. He's a gorilla. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4037.0s)]
*  That guy was so big at one point in time. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4039.0s)]
*  I remember he fought someone [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4041.0s)]
*  in Abu Dhabi and he got a bad decision. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4043.0s)]
*  So he took all his clothes off. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4045.0s)]
*  Pedepano. Yeah, Pedepano. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4047.0s)]
*  He neck cranked him and it was [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4049.0s)]
*  illegal. Pedepano tapped [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4051.0s)]
*  because he figured he's getting disqualified. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4053.0s)]
*  They told Monson he won and then [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4055.0s)]
*  cranked his neck. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4057.0s)]
*  It was illegal and they took it from him. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4059.0s)]
*  Look how jacked that dude was. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4061.0s)]
*  He's Russian now. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4063.0s)]
*  Hanzo said his shorts that he took off [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4065.0s)]
*  like they had one of them side [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4067.0s)]
*  like open bars. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4069.0s)]
*  His shorts were hanging in one of the bars in Brazil. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4071.0s)]
*  That's exactly the way my father [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4073.0s)]
*  does it. Yeah. I mean, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4075.0s)]
*  he was so fucking strong. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4077.0s)]
*  That's one of my moves too. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4079.0s)]
*  He inspired me when I had the fight for the title. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4081.0s)]
*  He inspired me to go for [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4083.0s)]
*  broke because his fight with Tim Silver is the worst [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4085.0s)]
*  piece of shit I ever seen in my life. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4087.0s)]
*  I saw that fight [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4089.0s)]
*  and it was a short ball [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4091.0s)]
*  guy shooting from across the cage [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4093.0s)]
*  on that big dork [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4095.0s)]
*  Tim Silver and fucking [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4097.0s)]
*  you know [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4099.0s)]
*  it was fucking the worst fight. I go [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4101.0s)]
*  look, I will rather get knocked the [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4103.0s)]
*  fuck out than have that as [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4105.0s)]
*  my one title shot because that's what it [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4107.0s)]
*  would have looked. It might have resembled that if I just tried to get [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4109.0s)]
*  George down. You know what I mean? I remember [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4111.0s)]
*  that knockout like it was yesterday. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4113.0s)]
*  While it was happening I could not fucking [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4115.0s)]
*  believe my eyes when you knocked out GSP. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4117.0s)]
*  I remember that too. I was like holy [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4119.0s)]
*  shit. Yeah. You always had weird [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4121.0s)]
*  power. Some dudes just have [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4123.0s)]
*  weird power. Yeah. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4125.0s)]
*  Long ago. You know what it was though? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4127.0s)]
*  When we came into [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4129.0s)]
*  it's the journey of the [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4131.0s)]
*  of the way the philosophy is. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4133.0s)]
*  My philosophy was I was like a street fighting kid. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4135.0s)]
*  I knocked a couple guys out. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4137.0s)]
*  I did a tough man contest at 18. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4139.0s)]
*  Mr. T was the referee. I broke this up. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4141.0s)]
*  I swear to God. Mr. T [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4143.0s)]
*  was the referee. If you look at it, I [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4145.0s)]
*  broke this up the last time I was actually here. Fucking how many years [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4147.0s)]
*  ago. And I knocked two guys [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4149.0s)]
*  out and the third guy I lost, worst concussion [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4151.0s)]
*  I had in my life. I fought three times in an hour [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4153.0s)]
*  at the Palladium in Manhattan. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4155.0s)]
*  To this day my jaw [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4157.0s)]
*  from that fucking man. Oh my god. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4159.0s)]
*  From that contact. That was your jaw? [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4161.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Yeah. I thought it was [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4163.0s)]
*  I wanted to go eat pizza afterwards. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4165.0s)]
*  My shit was out of whack so I figured [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4167.0s)]
*  it was a broken jaw. And I went there [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4169.0s)]
*  they said it wasn't broken. But [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4171.0s)]
*  to that day. Oh my god. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4173.0s)]
*  It's so weird. It's fucked up. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4175.0s)]
*  But uh. Was it hurt? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4177.0s)]
*  What was that again? Uh power [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4179.0s)]
*  weird power. Yeah. Yeah weird power. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4181.0s)]
*  Dean's over. He knows me well. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4183.0s)]
*  I gotta keep. I know guys. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4185.0s)]
*  It's bad. But uh. Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4187.0s)]
*  So then when the Gracies came along [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4189.0s)]
*  that's when I was 18. So then [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4191.0s)]
*  the Gracies came along they go no no you could never [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4193.0s)]
*  exchange. Don't exchange. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4195.0s)]
*  It's a crapshoot if you exchange. Don't [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4197.0s)]
*  exchange. Exchange. Close [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4199.0s)]
*  the distance. So I adapted [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4201.0s)]
*  that philosophy. And I [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4203.0s)]
*  was living Jiu Jitsu. Living [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4205.0s)]
*  it. Living it. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4207.0s)]
*  Living it. And then ignoring the striking [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4209.0s)]
*  cause everybody was at that point. Cause [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4211.0s)]
*  it was like when the UFC [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4213.0s)]

*  knocking guys out like that was wild. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4271.0s)]
*  When I had to fight. Thank you. First of all [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4273.0s)]
*  thanks. When I had to fight Carol Parisian [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4275.0s)]
*  I took the fight and I was I was healthy [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4279.0s)]
*  but when I first got the call [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4281.0s)]
*  a few weeks before that a couple weeks before that [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4283.0s)]
*  I had a torn meniscus. So when they [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4285.0s)]
*  asked me I'm like [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4287.0s)]
*  I could run. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4289.0s)]
*  I go defeat the floor didn't feel good. The wrestling [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4291.0s)]
*  I couldn't do. So I [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4293.0s)]
*  felt like it's going to tear off. I did that. But I could [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4295.0s)]
*  do some Jiu Jitsu. I could [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4297.0s)]
*  run and I could box. So we did a lot [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4299.0s)]
*  of boxing for that. He would. And I think [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4301.0s)]
*  that truly helped me because [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4303.0s)]
*  it's weird [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4305.0s)]
*  because I got tied in that fight and I [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4307.0s)]
*  very rarely get tied and I truly believe is [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4309.0s)]
*  because I did not mimic the fight with [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4311.0s)]
*  defeat the floor sparring. I didn't do it. So you [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4313.0s)]
*  know when that's a [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4315.0s)]
*  that's a different kind of win [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4317.0s)]
*  that you need to do it. It's like [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4319.0s)]
*  wrestling. It's up and down up and down. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4321.0s)]
*  And I didn't have that. And I got one of my [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4323.0s)]
*  few times in my career I got winded. And it was [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4325.0s)]
*  Carol one of the [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4327.0s)]
*  he's probably one of the worst guys to get winded with. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4329.0s)]
*  Because that motherfucker had a good gas tank. So I almost [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4331.0s)]
*  knocked him out in the beginning because all that boxing [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4333.0s)]
*  I just didn't have hands for that fucking thing. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4335.0s)]
*  And I was really getting used to rolling and coming back [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4337.0s)]
*  and landing and Longo was happy with it. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4339.0s)]
*  He was taking me to Brooklyn to work at Lou Neglia's [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4341.0s)]
*  school too in Brooklyn. And I was getting [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4343.0s)]
*  fresh faces. And I was really starting [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4345.0s)]
*  to feel good and get the timing that [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4347.0s)]
*  I never had with the stand up. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4349.0s)]
*  So where I fucked up with I had him [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4351.0s)]
*  hurt. I had him up [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4353.0s)]
*  against the fucking thing. He got a fucking [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4355.0s)]
*  judo grip inside my fucking pants. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4357.0s)]
*  You see me go to the ref. He's got a grip. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4359.0s)]
*  And by that time he weathered it. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4361.0s)]
*  I started to shoot my load. Got tired. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4363.0s)]
*  It went the way it went. That got me [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4365.0s)]
*  into the tough house which led to good things. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4367.0s)]
*  But two things. The one [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4369.0s)]
*  when I got him hurt I didn't line that [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4371.0s)]
*  shit up. You know what I'm saying? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4373.0s)]
*  So when I hurt George [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4375.0s)]
*  Longo pointed to that. He goes [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4377.0s)]
*  when you hurt him [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4379.0s)]
*  manage your distance. Keep your distance. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4381.0s)]
*  Manage and line it up. And that's what we did. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4383.0s)]
*  And a couple of things Longo had me doing [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4385.0s)]
*  with a he had me having a fucking ball [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4387.0s)]
*  like a medicine ball [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4389.0s)]
*  kind of. It was rubber [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4391.0s)]
*  but it was heavy. And he would have me just [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4393.0s)]
*  throw it during the circuit training [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4395.0s)]
*  even if the sparring. 25 [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4397.0s)]
*  times. That's his fucking head. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4399.0s)]
*  Dude. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4401.0s)]
*  I'm throwing the fucking dick. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4403.0s)]
*  That fucking Longo [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4405.0s)]
*  really made me believe that [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4407.0s)]
*  I could fucking stand with this guy. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4409.0s)]
*  He goes they think you're going to try to get him down. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4411.0s)]
*  You're not going to try to get him down. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4413.0s)]
*  And I remember looking at that Jeff Munson fight and that [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4415.0s)]
*  cemented it. I go dude. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4417.0s)]
*  Because you wasn't going to do that right? I'm not doing that. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4419.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do that. I go I'm [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4421.0s)]
*  so I didn't know I was going to knock him out but I knew [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4423.0s)]
*  that I had a very good chance [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4425.0s)]
*  of doing it because I was hurting guys with the 60 ounce gloves. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4427.0s)]
*  And you know Longo's [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4429.0s)]
*  like look man he's fucking [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4431.0s)]
*  standing up. He's doing some karate [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4433.0s)]
*  shit. It's not that big. Listen [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4435.0s)]
*  I love George. And he's better. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4437.0s)]
*  The stuff he was doing standing at the time [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4439.0s)]
*  Longo had guys feeding me the exact shit. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4441.0s)]
*  It was weird. It was some Matrix shit. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4443.0s)]
*  Because then in the fight I remember [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4445.0s)]
*  at one point he did a high kick a low kick a high kick. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4447.0s)]
*  I remember just being like bing bing. Oh I feel like [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4449.0s)]
*  Spiderman. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4451.0s)]
*  So it just it was a good it [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4453.0s)]
*  felt like a good day of sparring you know. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4455.0s)]
*  And by the way everybody out there [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4457.0s)]
*  don't watch the rematch. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4459.0s)]
*  When you went into the rematch were you injured? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4463.0s)]
*  You never [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4465.0s)]
*  well who's not injured? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4467.0s)]
*  Be honest. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4469.0s)]
*  I'm going to just tell you the word. The word [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4471.0s)]
*  was before the rematch Matt had heard his [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4473.0s)]
*  back. And I had heard [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4475.0s)]
*  that you'd hurt your back. Well the thing is this [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4477.0s)]
*  I this is [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4479.0s)]
*  what happened. I was supposed to fight [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4481.0s)]
*  Matt Hughes. Right. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4483.0s)]
*  And that's when you hurt your back. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4485.0s)]
*  I hurt my back. Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4487.0s)]
*  And then I was out. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4491.0s)]
*  And then that's when they [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4493.0s)]
*  fought. Matt this was New Year's Eve. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4495.0s)]
*  This was New Year's Eve when I was out with my back. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4497.0s)]
*  So they fought [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4499.0s)]
*  New Year's Eve I know because we did a watch party [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4501.0s)]
*  at MSG you know. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4503.0s)]
*  And they fought so I didn't know who I was fighting [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4505.0s)]
*  that point. So then [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4507.0s)]
*  my back was out so then George [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4509.0s)]
*  beat Matt. So now [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4511.0s)]
*  I was fighting George. I was going to fight Matt as my first [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4513.0s)]
*  title defense. So now [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4515.0s)]
*  I was going to fight George. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4517.0s)]
*  And then I fought George so my back was [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4519.0s)]
*  out on what is that? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4521.0s)]
*  The 31st [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4523.0s)]
*  of December. So this is the very injury you were talking about earlier. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4525.0s)]
*  Yes the very same injury I talked about earlier [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4527.0s)]
*  because I was supposed to fight. No! [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4529.0s)]
*  Yes! That is the [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4531.0s)]
*  same injury. I was supposed to fight Matt. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4533.0s)]
*  That's right. I ended up fighting Matt eventually. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4535.0s)]
*  But that's what it was. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4537.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think of the timeline. So this was [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4539.0s)]
*  December [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4541.0s)]
*  what is it? 31st. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4543.0s)]
*  That's when they fought. So then [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4545.0s)]
*  I had to fight George in April. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4547.0s)]
*  So there's months there for me [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4549.0s)]
*  but I had to go through a camp. Yeah but if you have herniated [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4551.0s)]
*  discs and you go to a chiropractor [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4553.0s)]
*  he's doing Zulu on you. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4555.0s)]
*  He's hanging by your ankles. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4557.0s)]
*  I wasn't walking then [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4559.0s)]
*  but I ended up getting the weight off [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4561.0s)]
*  and being able to fight. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4563.0s)]
*  You weren't walking? I wasn't [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4565.0s)]
*  well I was walking but how about [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4567.0s)]
*  this? When you bend over [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4569.0s)]
*  to brush your teeth I wasn't able to do this. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4571.0s)]
*  I was a fucking mess. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4573.0s)]
*  For how long? It was [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4575.0s)]
*  my black belt [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4577.0s)]
*  Dr. Yasha. I'm giving him [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4579.0s)]
*  a shout out because he gave me an epidural [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4581.0s)]
*  in the city. You know Yasha. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4583.0s)]
*  I know you had two epidurals before that fight. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4585.0s)]
*  I didn't want to say it unless you did. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4587.0s)]
*  Well he gave that to me in [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4589.0s)]
*  I guess January. So what does that do? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4591.0s)]
*  It just kills the pain. I don't know [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4593.0s)]
*  what it did exactly but it got me [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4595.0s)]
*  back. It got me back to being [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4597.0s)]
*  an epidural. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4599.0s)]
*  It's just a pain. It's more of a surgery [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4601.0s)]
*  thing. It does not always work [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4603.0s)]
*  either. It helped me. I was [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4605.0s)]
*  afraid. I wasn't coming back. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4607.0s)]
*  And he got me back. You know? But that's what they do [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4609.0s)]
*  with women when they give birth. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4611.0s)]
*  That's 100%. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4613.0s)]
*  I've had it for sciatica. I've had [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4615.0s)]
*  the shots. It provides anesthesia that creates a [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4617.0s)]
*  band of numbness from your belly button [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4619.0s)]
*  to your upper legs. It allows you to be awake [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4621.0s)]
*  and alert through labor. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4623.0s)]
*  But it's also [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4625.0s)]
*  an epidural for [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4627.0s)]
*  back injuries. Google that [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4629.0s)]
*  epidural back injuries. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4631.0s)]
*  It must be some sort of a pain. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4633.0s)]
*  Epidural there it is. Blocker. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4635.0s)]
*  January. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4637.0s)]
*  That's where it is. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4639.0s)]
*  Epidural steroid injections. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4641.0s)]
*  Anesthesia injection. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4643.0s)]
*  Inject an anesthetic into the [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4645.0s)]
*  epidural spine around your spine so [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4647.0s)]
*  it can stop pain signals. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4649.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4651.0s)]
*  But your back is still weak. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4653.0s)]
*  It still fucks up. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4655.0s)]
*  Did it affect your movement? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4657.0s)]
*  With the epidural? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4659.0s)]
*  I don't want you to say this because you should [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4661.0s)]
*  make an excuse. I'm just asking you as a [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4663.0s)]
*  human being. What was it like? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4665.0s)]
*  I'm going to say [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4667.0s)]
*  this is what I'll say. The epidural [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4669.0s)]
*  it took me a little bit to get back [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4671.0s)]
*  into being able to train [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4673.0s)]
*  properly. But you got to think [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4675.0s)]
*  I got to that fight. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4677.0s)]
*  I got [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4679.0s)]
*  it wasn't my fucking best [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4681.0s)]
*  camp but I got there [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4683.0s)]
*  and I showed up and I took my [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4685.0s)]
*  shot and I signed the dotted [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4687.0s)]
*  line. And I feel [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4689.0s)]
*  George was so on point that night. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4691.0s)]
*  What a fucking night that was too man. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4693.0s)]
*  That was fucking insane. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4695.0s)]
*  Dude chance of fuck you Sarah. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4697.0s)]
*  Longo doesn't speak quietly. I [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4699.0s)]
*  couldn't hear him in between rounds. Chance [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4701.0s)]
*  of fuck you Sarah. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4703.0s)]
*  All I hear is fuck you Sarah. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4705.0s)]
*  You know what it was? It was around the time [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4707.0s)]
*  of [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4709.0s)]
*  Talladega Nights. So I did a thing [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4711.0s)]
*  where I go he should just drink his red wine and shut the [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4713.0s)]
*  fuck up. I was doing some [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4715.0s)]
*  I was calling him Frenchy. But it was all from [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4717.0s)]
*  the movie. And I loved George. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4719.0s)]
*  And it was [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4721.0s)]
*  I was a kid too. Whatever it was. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4723.0s)]
*  But I feel George [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4725.0s)]
*  was so on point that night [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4727.0s)]
*  that if I had my [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4729.0s)]
*  even if I wasn't fucking tip top [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4731.0s)]
*  I think I probably it probably would have resembled [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4733.0s)]
*  him and Nick Diaz [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4735.0s)]
*  with me. I didn't [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4737.0s)]
*  like that I stopped. You know what I mean? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4739.0s)]
*  That tortured me. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4741.0s)]
*  Matter of fact when I was going to fight Frank Trigg [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4743.0s)]
*  there was pictures of Frank Trigg's [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4745.0s)]
*  face photoshopped on George saying [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4747.0s)]
*  I remember reading a thing who else thinks that [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4749.0s)]
*  Frank Trigg is going to wrestle fuck Sarah. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4751.0s)]
*  I go what the fuck is that. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4753.0s)]
*  I'm a jiu jitsu guy. Anyway [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4755.0s)]
*  so just like I told Crone [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4759.0s)]
*  I had to get I had to kick somebody else's [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4761.0s)]
*  ass because I don't like [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4763.0s)]
*  the way that second fight went. It felt horrible. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4765.0s)]
*  Did you ever get over the back injury? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4767.0s)]
*  Yeah I feel good. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4769.0s)]
*  Knock on wood. Doesn't bother you at all [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4771.0s)]
*  anymore? There's times where just [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4773.0s)]
*  like a couple weeks ago I felt a little something [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4775.0s)]
*  it makes me nervous where I'm like [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4777.0s)]
*  I feel if I do this I don't want you. You remember [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4779.0s)]
*  what it was like. Do you have any back things? [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4781.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. It's worse. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4783.0s)]
*  It's worse than anything you could think of. Then your knees [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4785.0s)]
*  because I have that new knee put in and [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4787.0s)]
*  this and that. The back is worse [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4789.0s)]
*  because you can't do anything. Like you can't do anything. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4791.0s)]
*  That's why Al Jemaine [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4793.0s)]
*  getting his disc replaced [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4795.0s)]
*  in his neck. Oh wow yeah. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4797.0s)]
*  That is wild that he goes on [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4799.0s)]
*  to do that and then dominates [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4801.0s)]
*  Piotr in the rematch and [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4803.0s)]
*  then you know runs through TJ [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4805.0s)]
*  Dillashaw and then beats Henry [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4807.0s)]
*  and out wrestles Henry. Wild. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4809.0s)]
*  He gets a lot of, he gets unwanted [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4811.0s)]
*  hate and he's such a likable guy. And I don't think anymore. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4813.0s)]
*  I think the tide is turning. People are starting to like him now. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4815.0s)]
*  I think the tide is turning especially after [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4817.0s)]
*  the Hudo fight. I mean come on man [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4819.0s)]
*  give the gentleman his due. You know [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4821.0s)]
*  I was in the corner that [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4823.0s)]
*  night and I was shocked that it was [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4825.0s)]
*  I was shocked that it was [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4827.0s)]
*  close. I mean maybe if you watch [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4829.0s)]
*  I watched it like I remember just thinking like [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4831.0s)]
*  maybe one round he lost [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4833.0s)]
*  and I'm usually pretty, very fair [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4835.0s)]
*  in judgment but [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4837.0s)]
*  you know yeah judges [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4839.0s)]
*  sometimes you do look crazy. Sometimes [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4841.0s)]
*  they just get it all fucked up [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4843.0s)]
*  and it's so dangerous. It is not scary. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4845.0s)]
*  It's like it can change your career one way or the [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4847.0s)]
*  other. It's like I heard a split [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4849.0s)]
*  decision online. Not a split. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4851.0s)]
*  Was it a split? It was a split. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4853.0s)]
*  I know you're not like oh I hope they don't [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4855.0s)]
*  do this to this fucking kid. Oh my god. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4857.0s)]
*  You know that is people forget [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4859.0s)]
*  too. They remember who won. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4861.0s)]
*  When you look at the record books they remember who won. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4863.0s)]
*  Especially if it's close enough. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4865.0s)]
*  It's close enough. You know like the Devin Hamey [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4867.0s)]
*  Lomachenko fight. Right. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4869.0s)]
*  Devin Hamey is going to go down forever [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4871.0s)]
*  as being the guy who won. Whereas a lot of people saw [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4873.0s)]
*  that they thought Lomachenko won. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4875.0s)]
*  So that's one of those doesn't matter forever. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4877.0s)]
*  He still won on paper. That's how [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4879.0s)]
*  it counts. I remember a fight when [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4881.0s)]
*  they raised his due's hand and then they backstage [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4883.0s)]
*  they changed it. What fight was that? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4885.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4887.0s)]
*  Oh that's right. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4889.0s)]
*  And that's why [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4891.0s)]
*  nothing made me more happy. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4893.0s)]
*  I was at that fight too. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4895.0s)]
*  Nothing made me more happy when he beat [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4897.0s)]
*  GSP because by MMA math I was [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4899.0s)]
*  the world champ. That's right. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4901.0s)]
*  How did they [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4903.0s)]
*  do that? What was that colossal [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4905.0s)]
*  fuck up? Basically [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4907.0s)]
*  one of the judges wrote his score [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4909.0s)]
*  where he would, where my [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4911.0s)]
*  name was and he had it upside [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4913.0s)]
*  down. He used the excuse that we look alike. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4915.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4919.0s)]
*  All I know is I'm backstage going [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4921.0s)]
*  oh man, that was a close one. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4923.0s)]
*  Fuck man. All I know is I'm chasing [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4925.0s)]
*  him around getting jammed in the fucking face. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4927.0s)]
*  I finally get him down. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4929.0s)]
*  So I mean it was one of those things [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4931.0s)]
*  where I didn't [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4933.0s)]
*  feel like I lost but [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4935.0s)]
*  listen he won the fight. He was using [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4937.0s)]
*  I always [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4939.0s)]
*  had that attitude where I was going forward [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4941.0s)]
*  so I felt like I won. I was pulling a fucking [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4943.0s)]
*  Henry Chihudo. I lost the fight. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4945.0s)]
*  You want to hear it now? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4947.0s)]
*  Podcast with Cocksucker. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4949.0s)]
*  I got the tattoo to prove it. I really got the tattoo. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4951.0s)]
*  He got a tattoo that says, hey man I won. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4953.0s)]
*  He did. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4955.0s)]
*  He always breaks his balls about it. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4957.0s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4959.0s)]
*  That's great. Oh my god that's hilarious. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4961.0s)]
*  It took, so I was [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4963.0s)]
*  backstage and all of a sudden [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4965.0s)]
*  he's in the locker room next to me. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4967.0s)]
*  So all of a sudden I hear them, so Dan [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4969.0s)]
*  went in his room, I didn't know that first. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4971.0s)]
*  So all of a sudden I hear them all cheering. I go wow. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4973.0s)]
*  I guess it's great to be second place Cocksucker. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4975.0s)]
*  I'm like they're really taking this well. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4977.0s)]
*  All of a sudden Dana comes in and he's like I hate to [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4979.0s)]
*  tell you but they got it wrong. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4981.0s)]
*  And I'm like what? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4983.0s)]
*  I go ahhh. No no. I'm like really? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4985.0s)]
*  You fuck? I have [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4987.0s)]
*  to pay and everything? Anyway. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4989.0s)]
*  That seems. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4991.0s)]
*  It was fuck because like he got [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4993.0s)]
*  his hand raised. I never got my due. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4995.0s)]
*  But you know they were talking [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4997.0s)]
*  about trying to get that redone and have [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=4999.0s)]
*  Buffer announce me as the winner eventually. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5001.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5003.0s)]
*  Like you mean like still? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5005.0s)]
*  Yeah like still. I was like nah. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5007.0s)]
*  I was like nah I don't want to do that. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5009.0s)]
*  They should do that the next one. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5011.0s)]
*  We had a fight 35 years ago. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5013.0s)]
*  I was like nah I don't want to do that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5015.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5017.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5019.0s)]
*  I don't have any fight that [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5021.0s)]
*  I've lost. I don't know about you. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5023.0s)]
*  Or you Johnny. Or you Joe. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5025.0s)]
*  There's any, I don't think, there's not one fight [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5027.0s)]
*  that keeps me up at night. And when, nothing. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5029.0s)]
*  Me neither. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5031.0s)]
*  I don't know. When you're going through it [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5033.0s)]
*  and when you lose, especially when it's fresh [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5035.0s)]
*  I think you're going to feel that forever. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5037.0s)]
*  That pain. Right? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5039.0s)]
*  I don't know. I mean maybe [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5041.0s)]
*  it was because I had to see that Shoney [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5043.0s)]
*  Backfist a million times and they use that in every fucking promo. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5045.0s)]
*  I guess that maybe started me off being [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5047.0s)]
*  humble because it was the first Backfist ever. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5049.0s)]
*  You did dominate the whole [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5051.0s)]
*  earlier fight. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5053.0s)]
*  But my point is [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5055.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about any [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5057.0s)]
*  of them. And that's what I try to tell fighters [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5059.0s)]
*  as a coach now. I say [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5061.0s)]
*  listen, you got to fight your best fight [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5063.0s)]
*  because if you lose it's going to suck [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5065.0s)]
*  but you're not going to care in the future. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5067.0s)]
*  You know, I want to tell you something I'm opposed to. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5069.0s)]
*  What's that? I'm opposed to win bonuses. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5071.0s)]
*  Me too. I don't like it. I don't like it either. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5073.0s)]
*  I don't like it. I don't even know why it even [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5075.0s)]
*  it doesn't motivate fighters. I don't think it's fair. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5077.0s)]
*  I don't think it's fair. No. I don't think the [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5079.0s)]
*  judging can be counted on as being 100% [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5081.0s)]
*  accurate. I think it ruins careers. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5083.0s)]
*  I hate the win bonus. Yeah, I just [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5085.0s)]
*  think it's, you know, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5087.0s)]
*  you should [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5089.0s)]
*  get paid to fight. You're doing your best. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5091.0s)]
*  It's the UFC. Right. It's the [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5093.0s)]
*  highest level of the sport. These guys are not going to [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5095.0s)]
*  fight harder if they, you know, to [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5097.0s)]
*  win. They're going to fight their hardest. Yeah, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5099.0s)]
*  they always do. Yeah, they're not going to try to do [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5101.0s)]
*  something extra to get a win bonus. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5103.0s)]
*  To win. They're trying to win always. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5105.0s)]
*  Like it's not an incentive. It's just [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5107.0s)]
*  it just, in [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5109.0s)]
*  the case of bad judging, it just penalizes [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5111.0s)]
*  the fighter who did nothing wrong [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5113.0s)]
*  and they can maybe rectify [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5115.0s)]
*  it backstage with bonuses if they choose [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5117.0s)]
*  to do that, but I don't know how often they do. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5119.0s)]
*  But it shouldn't be, I think it should be [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5121.0s)]
*  a part of like what you fight for. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5123.0s)]
*  You have a contract. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5125.0s)]
*  That's what I think it should be like boxing. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5127.0s)]
*  You fight for X amount of money and that's [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5129.0s)]
*  what you fight for. That's where you get paid. Not [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5131.0s)]
*  whether or not the judges get it right. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5133.0s)]
*  Not whether or not some freak [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5135.0s)]
*  thing happens and you get injured. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5137.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? It just doesn't make [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5139.0s)]
*  sense to me. Yeah, I don't understand why they still have [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5141.0s)]
*  win bonuses because the win bonus and the commission [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5143.0s)]
*  is separate. So like [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5145.0s)]
*  the fact that if the judges [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5147.0s)]
*  get it wrong, it affects your [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5149.0s)]
*  money. Yeah. And it's completely [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5151.0s)]
*  separate. Maybe by 50%. So the UFC [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5153.0s)]
*  should just be like, you know what, we're going to [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5155.0s)]
*  just make it right for the fighters and just say, listen, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5157.0s)]
*  this is what you get paid. So it doesn't matter if [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5159.0s)]
*  they get it wrong. That's [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5161.0s)]
*  I would feel better about that just [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5163.0s)]
*  period anyway. It just doesn't make any sense [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5165.0s)]
*  to me. Yeah, it don't make sense to me either. I don't like [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5167.0s)]
*  it. Because it's like these guys [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5169.0s)]
*  are fighting. I mean, sometimes guys lose and they're fighting [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5171.0s)]
*  their fucking ass off. Like a split [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5173.0s)]
*  decision is so close. Oh my God. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5175.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Some of just crazy [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5177.0s)]
*  fucking wars where you're like, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5179.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. And I know [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5181.0s)]
*  they give people bonuses. Yeah. But [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5183.0s)]
*  that's still. Did you ever see the fight with [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5185.0s)]
*  Demir Ismagalov and [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5187.0s)]
*  Kudai Lodzai? Yes. And like [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5189.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there watching this fight. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5191.0s)]
*  I couldn't tell who won. I'm like, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5193.0s)]
*  one guy won the first round, the other guy won the second round [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5195.0s)]
*  and then at the end they were just going tooth [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5197.0s)]
*  and nail and they were just fighting their heart out. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5199.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then they ended up giving it to [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5201.0s)]
*  Ismagalov and I was like, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5203.0s)]
*  man, that sucks for Kudai Lodzai. Yeah. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5205.0s)]
*  Because he gets half his money. Yeah. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5207.0s)]
*  Half his money and it's just a toss up. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5209.0s)]
*  Yeah. There's a lot of those fights. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5211.0s)]
*  A lot of those fights. I mean, they do it [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5213.0s)]
*  for the incentive but I don't think it [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5215.0s)]
*  It doesn't incentivize anybody [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5217.0s)]
*  to fight harder. I don't think it does. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5219.0s)]
*  Listen, when you're in there, it's [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5221.0s)]
*  you're going to fight fucking hard. It's your fucking [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5223.0s)]
*  health at its center. Yeah, for sure. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5225.0s)]
*  You don't want to get your ass kicked. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5227.0s)]
*  What do you guys feel about, you know, I was having a conversation [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5229.0s)]
*  with Josh Barnett about this, about [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5231.0s)]
*  dehydration and losing your chin [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5233.0s)]
*  and the dangers of dehydration [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5235.0s)]
*  and then massive weight [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5237.0s)]
*  cuts in the age of no IVs. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5239.0s)]
*  Because if you saw it, you can't use an IV. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5241.0s)]
*  And I mean, how much do you think [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5243.0s)]
*  how much of an impact is that? [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5245.0s)]
*  It's a giant impact, right? I think so. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5247.0s)]
*  I think so. I think so. Yeah, for sure. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5249.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not trying to, yeah. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5251.0s)]
*  Like, when these guys cut too much weight, I always [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5253.0s)]
*  think, like, they feel like it's going to give them an advantage. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5255.0s)]
*  But the fact that you are [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5257.0s)]
*  dehydrating yourself so much, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5259.0s)]
*  it's actually a disadvantage. And does it [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5261.0s)]
*  dehydrate, it's hard to rehydrate the brain, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5263.0s)]
*  is that true? Yeah, for sure. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5265.0s)]
*  What they say, I mean, I'm not a doctor, but that's what they say. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5267.0s)]
*  You're not a doctor? I thought you went to chiropractor school. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5269.0s)]
*  Is that the case? Does it take longer [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5277.0s)]
*  to, how long does it take to rehydrate the brain [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5279.0s)]
*  after severe hydration? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5281.0s)]
*  Let's find that out. Because I think even with IV, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5283.0s)]
*  it takes a while. Yeah. But these guys, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5285.0s)]
*  you see some of them on Death's Door, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5287.0s)]
*  if somebody looked like that [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5289.0s)]
*  normally, and you're like, alright, dude, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5291.0s)]
*  you're fighting tomorrow for your life. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5293.0s)]
*  Do you know the worst I ever saw? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5295.0s)]
*  The worst I ever saw was Travis Luthor. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5297.0s)]
*  Travis Luthor was fighting Anderson. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5299.0s)]
*  He missed the weight. Dude, his [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5301.0s)]
*  lips were cracked. Like, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5303.0s)]
*  dried out and cracked. And he wasn't [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5305.0s)]
*  walking to the scale, he was shuffling [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5307.0s)]
*  to the scale. I mean, shuffling. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5309.0s)]
*  And he missed weight still. I mean, he was on [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5311.0s)]
*  Death's Door. And he got that opportunity [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5313.0s)]
*  from being on the show with us. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5315.0s)]
*  And he dominated the first [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5317.0s)]
*  round. Imagine if that guy goes in there [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5319.0s)]
*  healthy and finishes him. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5321.0s)]
*  Maybe there's no Anderson. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5323.0s)]
*  No bullshits. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5325.0s)]
*  Travis Luthor's got really, really good jujitsu. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5327.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5329.0s)]
*  And he had so much talent. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5331.0s)]
*  But he's funny. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5333.0s)]
*  Some guys maybe were too smart. We were in the [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5335.0s)]
*  house with him. And I remember, listen, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5337.0s)]
*  man, you know I like to eat. So I'm eating fucking raisins. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5339.0s)]
*  You think I want to eat raisins? He's eating [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5341.0s)]
*  M&Ms and shit. Yeah. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5343.0s)]
*  Now he's the fucking smart one, right? And he's going, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5345.0s)]
*  I go, dude, how are you doing that? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5347.0s)]
*  He's like, you're eating raisins. Sugar's [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5349.0s)]
*  sugar. I go, no, dude, I don't think so. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5351.0s)]
*  I go, listen, I ain't no fucking [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5353.0s)]
*  brain surgeon here, but I don't think [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5355.0s)]
*  sugar's sugar, bro. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5357.0s)]
*  Trust me. I mean, otherwise [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5359.0s)]
*  he's like, sugar's sugar. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5361.0s)]
*  Slower digestion to your body. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5363.0s)]
*  That's just fact. He's just telling me sugar's sugar. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5365.0s)]
*  He's like, I don't know what that is. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5367.0s)]
*  Do you know who he says is the most talented guy he's ever [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5369.0s)]
*  worked with? Who? Kevin Hollen. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5371.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Really? Travis Luthor says Kevin Hollen [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5373.0s)]
*  is the most talented guy. Yeah, as far as his students, yeah. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5375.0s)]
*  Kevin Hollen's talented as fuck. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5377.0s)]
*  When he puts it together, he's got crazy [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5379.0s)]
*  power. Yeah. I know. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5381.0s)]
*  Long whip Tommy Hearn style. Oh, yeah. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5383.0s)]
*  When he knocked out Buckley, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5385.0s)]
*  that straight right, whoo! [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5387.0s)]
*  That was nice. Whoo! He just seemed like he [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5389.0s)]
*  knocked out Chakaray from his back. He just seemed like [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5391.0s)]
*  he takes his career seriously. I think [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5393.0s)]
*  he does. I think he struggles with real strong [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5395.0s)]
*  wrestlers. I think he struggles [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5397.0s)]
*  with like Hamsat. But then, they made [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5399.0s)]
*  that crazy agreement to just have a kickboxing [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5401.0s)]
*  fight with Wonder Boy. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5403.0s)]
*  Do you understand what you're saying? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5405.0s)]
*  I know you see him in MMA [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5407.0s)]
*  with dudes who try to take him down, but if you don't [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5409.0s)]
*  give any threat to Wonder Boy that you're going to [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5411.0s)]
*  get taken down and Wonder Boy gets to [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5413.0s)]
*  do that karate shit on you, that's a [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5415.0s)]
*  fucking nightmare. I know. That guy moves [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5417.0s)]
*  like a cobra. See, even at 40 years [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5419.0s)]
*  old or however old he is now, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5421.0s)]
*  Wonder Boy is fucking terrifying. He's still [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5423.0s)]
*  keeping competitive too. Fuck yeah. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5425.0s)]
*  They're starting to get him down now, but [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5427.0s)]
*  how awesome is Wonder Boy and how awesome [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5429.0s)]
*  is his sidekick? That's such [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5431.0s)]
*  an underused weapon. Oh, I know. Oh, sure. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5433.0s)]
*  I love the goddamn sidekick. I like it [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5435.0s)]
*  defensively, offensively. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5437.0s)]
*  I mean, he has the best sidekick [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5439.0s)]
*  I've ever seen in MMA. Yeah, I know that. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5441.0s)]
*  He slides into it. Yes. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5443.0s)]
*  He lifts that leg up and slides [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5445.0s)]
*  in off the back foot. It's total like [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5447.0s)]
*  point karate style. It's perfect. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5449.0s)]
*  But it's amazing that no one else uses it [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5451.0s)]
*  like that. It takes a long time to develop that. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5453.0s)]
*  It's so, it's crazy. It's also you have to be taught [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5455.0s)]
*  to do it correctly because a lot of guys do it [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5457.0s)]
*  incorrectly and it just doesn't have [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5459.0s)]
*  any pop to it so they can't keep a [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5461.0s)]
*  guy off. Like John Jones does it correctly. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5463.0s)]
*  He fucks up dude's knees with that shit [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5465.0s)]
*  too. Remember he dropped Vitor to the body [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5467.0s)]
*  with a front leg sidekick. Yeah. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5469.0s)]
*  Remember that? I do remember that. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5471.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now it's after Vitor almost broke [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5473.0s)]
*  his arm in half. I know, yeah. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5475.0s)]
*  Vitor got so close to tapping John [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5477.0s)]
*  Jones. Any other human being other than [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5479.0s)]
*  John probably would have fucking tapped. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5481.0s)]
*  John's brother, one of his brothers played for [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5483.0s)]
*  the Ravens at that time and he was at [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5485.0s)]
*  the game the next day and he was [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5487.0s)]
*  slinged up. He was slinged up for a long time. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5489.0s)]
*  Remember when he was supposed to fight Chael Sonnen [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5491.0s)]
*  and they went through the, he agreed to do the [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5493.0s)]
*  ultimate fighter because he really couldn't train. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5495.0s)]
*  So he did that whole thing with Chael Sonnen, let it [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5497.0s)]
*  heal and then beat the fuck out of Chael and then broke [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5499.0s)]
*  his toe. Oh yeah. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5501.0s)]
*  His toe was like hanging upside down. Yeah, yeah. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5503.0s)]
*  His toe was upside down and he didn't realize it until I [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5505.0s)]
*  was interviewing him. Then he looked at his toes like, oh no. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5507.0s)]
*  That was pretty wild. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5509.0s)]
*  And he was kind of going into shock [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5511.0s)]
*  and he sat down. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5513.0s)]
*  Look at his toe. Bro, his toe was turned [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5515.0s)]
*  upside down. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5517.0s)]
*  So nasty. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5519.0s)]
*  Look at that thing. Oh my god. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5521.0s)]
*  So to this day, you know, he has to tape his toes [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5523.0s)]
*  up on that foot. Yeah. Yeah. And there was an issue [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5525.0s)]
*  at this last fight. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5527.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was the last fight. Yeah, see? So he tapes those toes [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5529.0s)]
*  up like that and they told [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5531.0s)]
*  them to take the stuff off below the toes. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5533.0s)]
*  That little piggy's going to the hospital. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5535.0s)]
*  He was telling them like, hey, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5537.0s)]
*  I can't fight unless I can tape [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5539.0s)]
*  these toes up, which is wild [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5541.0s)]
*  to think that [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5543.0s)]
*  literally the goat has a problem [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5545.0s)]
*  with one of his feet. Yeah, his toe. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5547.0s)]
*  He finished Vito with Americana, right? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5549.0s)]
*  Yes, he did. Yeah. And I remember it was [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5551.0s)]
*  one of my... Find that armbar. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5553.0s)]
*  Find that armbar. The armbar. And then he finished with [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5555.0s)]
*  Americana. Both basic, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5557.0s)]
*  fundamental stuff. I remember one of the kids at the [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5559.0s)]
*  school was like, oh, well he's just a black belt. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5561.0s)]
*  He gets finished with Americana. I feel like saying, dude, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5563.0s)]
*  what the fuck? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5565.0s)]
*  Because you haven't got caught [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5567.0s)]
*  in Americana in class lately, you're fighting in a cage, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5569.0s)]
*  you fucking idiot. Yeah. These guys [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5571.0s)]
*  think that... So here it is. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5573.0s)]
*  He gets him down. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5575.0s)]
*  And people wish to sleep on Vito's [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5577.0s)]
*  jiu-jitsu, bro. Look at this. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5579.0s)]
*  Look how tight this is. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5581.0s)]
*  That's awesome. I mean, that is [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5583.0s)]
*  fucking tight, man. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5585.0s)]
*  And it gets extended. I mean, it is [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5587.0s)]
*  fucking extended here. Look at this. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5589.0s)]
*  Ay-ya-ya. Now he's out. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5591.0s)]
*  That's good. He's not in that quick tap club. So he got out. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5593.0s)]
*  Let's take a look at that again. Let me see that again. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5595.0s)]
*  Is there any way we can see the Americana [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5597.0s)]
*  to him? So do it before [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5599.0s)]
*  that. When he was on the ground, initially [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5601.0s)]
*  was when it was the deepest. So he takes [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5603.0s)]
*  him down. I love it. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5605.0s)]
*  And watch the extension. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5607.0s)]
*  Watch the extension. Like, look at this here. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5609.0s)]
*  Ooh, baby, that is so deep. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5611.0s)]
*  Look, he got out of it though. He forced it out. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5613.0s)]
*  I wonder if he would have kept his heels [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5615.0s)]
*  hindsight. Who knows, man. I mean, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5617.0s)]
*  it was tight. It was tight as fuck. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5619.0s)]
*  And here he is. Now he's out. Now he's got [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5621.0s)]
*  the elbow out. And then, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5623.0s)]
*  you know, John starts fucking him up. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5625.0s)]
*  And there's a sidekick to the body. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5627.0s)]
*  So he hits him with that. And he just drops him. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5629.0s)]
*  And that sidekick to the knee is [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5635.0s)]
*  so good, man. It's so [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5637.0s)]
*  nasty. He cut right through his guard. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5639.0s)]
*  Like butter. There you go. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5641.0s)]
*  It's that crucifix position again. Well, John's [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5643.0s)]
*  a much bigger guy too. Vitor really [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5645.0s)]
*  is a hunt. There it is. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5647.0s)]
*  Vitor really is, you know, much [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5649.0s)]
*  better suited frame-wise to the 185 [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5651.0s)]
*  pound division. It's [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5653.0s)]
*  funny that whole TRT. He took that [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5655.0s)]
*  fight on short notice too, right? Yeah. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5657.0s)]
*  That was a fight where he was fighting at [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5659.0s)]
*  85. Speaking of TRT, I [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5661.0s)]
*  have a question. I don't know if any of you know the answer [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5663.0s)]
*  to. Connor's supposed to be coming [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5665.0s)]
*  back to fight Chandler. Maybe it's not happening. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5667.0s)]
*  Why, if a fighter [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5669.0s)]
*  is out of the testing pool, does he have to [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5671.0s)]
*  wait six months? Because they have to make [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5673.0s)]
*  sure that you're not, it's really not [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5675.0s)]
*  that scientific. I mean, if he was clean for a month [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5677.0s)]
*  or two months, that's not enough. Why is [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5679.0s)]
*  the number six? Well, here's the thing. It's in your face. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5681.0s)]
*  It's in your face why [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5683.0s)]
*  this is happening. That's 100%. This is in your face. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5685.0s)]
*  It's in your face. And we're letting it [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5687.0s)]
*  slide because he's got an [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5689.0s)]
*  injury that he has to recover from. Right. Agreed. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5691.0s)]
*  There's no other reason why you wouldn't [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5693.0s)]
*  be, unless it's cocaine. Right. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5695.0s)]
*  Unless there's something else you're worried about [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5699.0s)]
*  getting tested positive for, which they do test, which [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5701.0s)]
*  is kind of wild. Right. Kind of wild that they do [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5703.0s)]
*  they test for that. Like that ain't helping [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5705.0s)]
*  nobody. Right. Unless you're Aaron Prior. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5707.0s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5709.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, Aaron Prior. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5711.0s)]
*  Yeah, Alexis Arguello. They gave him coke [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5713.0s)]
*  in the corner. Yeah. Rest in peace to [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5715.0s)]
*  the green Panama Lewis. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5717.0s)]
*  Yeah, Panama Lewis. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5719.0s)]
*  I used to train with that guy. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5721.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Is this before [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5723.0s)]
*  or after the Luis Resto fight? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5725.0s)]
*  Remember the Luis Resto fight? This poor guy's [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5727.0s)]
*  face. Yeah, he [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5729.0s)]
*  was coaching Luis Resto and he took all the padding [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5731.0s)]
*  out of the gloves. Yeah. He was fighting [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5733.0s)]
*  what was the kid's name? Billy Costello Jr.? [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5735.0s)]
*  I can't remember. He wrecked that kid forever. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5737.0s)]
*  He wrecked his fate and then the kid wound up committing suicide. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5739.0s)]
*  And they wouldn't let Panama [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5741.0s)]
*  work anymore. They wouldn't let him get a license. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5743.0s)]
*  Is that the guy with the plaster [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5745.0s)]
*  in the thing or is that something different? No, no, no. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5747.0s)]
*  That was different. I think you're talking about Margarito. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5749.0s)]
*  Yeah, Margarito. Yeah, Billy Collins. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5751.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's Billy Collins versus Luis [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5753.0s)]
*  Resto. So Billy Collins [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5755.0s)]
*  was this up and coming, real promising [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5757.0s)]
*  young kid and Luis Resto [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5759.0s)]
*  was not like a big puncher. That's [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5761.0s)]
*  why it was so crazy that he was busting him up. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5763.0s)]
*  And Luis Resto has no [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5765.0s)]
*  padding in his gloves. So [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5767.0s)]
*  every time he's hitting him, he's just hitting [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5769.0s)]
*  him with bare knuckle. Original bare knuckle. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5771.0s)]
*  Taped bare knuckles too. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5773.0s)]
*  And Billy Collins is so confused. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5775.0s)]
*  He was getting battered in that fight. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5777.0s)]
*  And he was [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5779.0s)]
*  look at his head. His head's all lumped up. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5781.0s)]
*  Look at his face. And what happened [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5783.0s)]
*  to this kid? He lost his vision. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5785.0s)]
*  His vision was fucked up and he wound up [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5787.0s)]
*  becoming an alcoholic. And I think he [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5789.0s)]
*  died by suicide in a [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5791.0s)]
*  car accident. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5793.0s)]
*  That's sad, man. Yeah, I mean, look at his face. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5795.0s)]
*  His face is unbelievably swollen. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5797.0s)]
*  And everyone was really confused because Luis [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5799.0s)]
*  Resto was not that big of a puncher. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5801.0s)]
*  And then his dad went over after the [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5803.0s)]
*  fight and grabbed Luis gloves. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5805.0s)]
*  And he felt the gloves. And he felt [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5807.0s)]
*  the knuckles straight through the glove. And he knew there was no padding in there. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5809.0s)]
*  See? His dad right there is grabbing him. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5811.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. See that? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5813.0s)]
*  He's grabbing the gloves. Wait a minute. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5815.0s)]
*  He's like, look at that. He's got no padding in his gloves. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5817.0s)]
*  He's pushing straight through. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5819.0s)]
*  Yo, that's some cheap shit. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5821.0s)]
*  So what happened to this? That's so evil. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5823.0s)]
*  Oh, you should see that guy's face a couple days later. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5825.0s)]
*  Yeah, his eyes were swollen up. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5827.0s)]
*  I mean, he wound up losing his vision. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5829.0s)]
*  That's sad. Panama Lewis. There he goes right there [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5831.0s)]
*  with the red shirt. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5833.0s)]
*  Panama Lewis wound up getting kicked up. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5835.0s)]
*  But he did work with Tyson. Like, it was like a sort of [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5837.0s)]
*  non-corner man role [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5839.0s)]
*  back in the day. I mean, he used to just hang out [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5841.0s)]
*  in the gyms. Yeah. Yeah. So like that was what he [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5843.0s)]
*  That's so evil. Before he passed away, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5845.0s)]
*  he just hung out in the gyms. But his dad's over in [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5847.0s)]
*  their corner. Oh, that's so evil. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5849.0s)]
*  I still think that boxing's a [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5851.0s)]
*  way tougher sport [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5853.0s)]
*  for you as far as your health [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5855.0s)]
*  than MMA. I do. 100%. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5857.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, it's hard. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5859.0s)]
*  Just the head trauma. Yeah. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5861.0s)]
*  It's, you know, I mean, these guys, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5863.0s)]
*  they spar hard, too. They spar [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5865.0s)]
*  hard. I know. You watch some of the [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5867.0s)]
*  Gervonta Davis sparring sessions. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5869.0s)]
*  Oh, man. Oh, my God. He's going to war. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5871.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's going to war and spar. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5873.0s)]
*  Or like, in Mayweathers, I heard they would just do [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5875.0s)]
*  like these sparring sessions where they don't put time [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5877.0s)]
*  on. They just let guys just go at it. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5879.0s)]
*  Just duke it out. They jump them into [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5881.0s)]
*  the gym, basically. Jesus. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5883.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5885.0s)]
*  look at this. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5887.0s)]
*  Gervonta [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5889.0s)]
*  Davis is such a weird talent. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5891.0s)]
*  So different than any other boxer. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5893.0s)]
*  In terms of like, the economy. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5895.0s)]
*  Like, that guy throws so few punches [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5897.0s)]
*  and everyone he hits you with is so dangerous. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5899.0s)]
*  Counts. But it's so interesting [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5901.0s)]
*  to watch him in the beginning of fights [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5903.0s)]
*  where guys like try to get a lead [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5905.0s)]
*  on him. Yeah. And he's just kind of [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5907.0s)]
*  measuring you up, measuring you up, and you're [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5909.0s)]
*  trying real hard to beat him. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5911.0s)]
*  And he's just kind of measuring you up, measuring [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5913.0s)]
*  you up. And then just bang! And the [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5915.0s)]
*  movement. God damn, he closes [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5917.0s)]
*  that distance so fast. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5919.0s)]
*  And throws that left [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5921.0s)]
*  uppercut. Yeah, so fast. It's so ferocious. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5923.0s)]
*  His straight left, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5925.0s)]
*  the one that he knocked down Davis with, the first [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5927.0s)]
*  one. Yeah. Oh my God. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5929.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5931.0s)]
*  Yeah. Or Ryan Garcia [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5933.0s)]
*  rather. The one he knocked down Ryan Garcia with. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5935.0s)]
*  That first left hand he dropped him with. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5937.0s)]
*  And then the one to the body. Dude, he's so [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5939.0s)]
*  talented. He's so good. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5941.0s)]
*  Shit, man. Such a good time for [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5943.0s)]
*  boxing. It is. Like right now, like boxing [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5945.0s)]
*  is probably, just what we thought, just [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5947.0s)]
*  every time we think boxing's on his last leg, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5949.0s)]
*  man, they put together a big [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5951.0s)]
*  fight to keep it alive. I mean, I do [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5953.0s)]
*  believe him and Garcia being, like, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5955.0s)]
*  finally two guys in their prime [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5957.0s)]
*  out of having a big fight. Now you're seeing [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5959.0s)]
*  Crawford and Spence are going at it. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5961.0s)]
*  That's the big one. That's one I never, I thought [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5963.0s)]
*  they'd fight like Pacquiao and Mayweather. Right, you thought that [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5965.0s)]
*  was never going to happen. It'd be too late. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5967.0s)]
*  I think they're starting to jump start it. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5969.0s)]
*  Hey, let's start fighting each other. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=5971.0s)]

*  So I play with Mike Fowler. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6077.0s)]
*  He's in a Y. So me and Mike are playing. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6079.0s)]
*  We're nerds. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6081.0s)]
*  We are. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6083.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, you gotta see, my wife comes... Every time I'm playing, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6085.0s)]
*  she'll fucking... I'll be in there, I'll be like, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6087.0s)]
*  I'm gonna snipe! [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6089.0s)]
*  And my wife comes and she hits my fucking balls. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6091.0s)]
*  She goes, you think you're getting some later. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6093.0s)]
*  I go, honey, I was all in favor. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6095.0s)]
*  It's all I like to do. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6097.0s)]
*  We were talking about it earlier with him in the video games. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6099.0s)]
*  I'm talking way back in the day. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6101.0s)]
*  Oh, right, there I am. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6103.0s)]
*  Look at you go! [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6105.0s)]
*  I upgraded since then. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6107.0s)]
*  That's me in my living room. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6109.0s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6111.0s)]
*  Well, that's what I'm climbing and stuff. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6113.0s)]
*  You're climbing? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6115.0s)]
*  This is not a game. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6117.0s)]
*  This is not a game. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6119.0s)]
*  This is not nearly as fun. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6121.0s)]
*  Now I got my... [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6123.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm flying now! [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6125.0s)]
*  I'm flying! [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6127.0s)]
*  There I am! [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6129.0s)]
*  But it's... Listen, I know it looks really special. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6131.0s)]
*  No, no, we have those. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6133.0s)]
*  You know what's great? The fucking shadow boxing game. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6135.0s)]
*  It's hard! [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6137.0s)]
*  It's good! [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6139.0s)]
*  It's good work, too. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6141.0s)]
*  It's the future, man. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6143.0s)]
*  I fucking can't wait. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6145.0s)]
*  One of my favorite movies is Ready Player One. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6147.0s)]
*  And I listen to the audio book a little, too. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6149.0s)]
*  It's a great fucking movie. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6151.0s)]
*  It's a great movie for your kids. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6153.0s)]
*  Jamie, before I forget, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6155.0s)]
*  they got a Taekwondo version of this now. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6157.0s)]
*  So they're doing kicks now. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6159.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6161.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6163.0s)]
*  There was something they just demonstrated. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6165.0s)]
*  So they put these leg things on people, [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6167.0s)]
*  and a guy and a girl were having a sparring match virtually. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6169.0s)]
*  So they bowed to each other, shook hands, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6171.0s)]
*  and they went to the opposite side of the room. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6173.0s)]
*  They put their head gear on. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6175.0s)]
*  And they started having this Taekwondo match. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6177.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6179.0s)]
*  Cool shit, man. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6181.0s)]
*  I'm thinking as this gets more sophisticated, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6183.0s)]
*  they could do a Muay Thai version. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6185.0s)]
*  You really couldn't do a Jiu Jitsu version, obviously. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6187.0s)]
*  But I think you could do a Muay Thai version. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6189.0s)]
*  When it gets better, I think... [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6191.0s)]
*  Dude, I mean, listen. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6193.0s)]
*  I like that my... even though I got a new battery pack, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6195.0s)]
*  I can go longer. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6197.0s)]
*  But I like that it wears off. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6199.0s)]
*  I like that it wears off. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6201.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6203.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I just saw it. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6205.0s)]
*  Oh, it's from 2021? [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6207.0s)]
*  But see if you can find a video of it, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6209.0s)]
*  because the video I just saw yesterday for the first time. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6211.0s)]
*  I think that's it right there. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6213.0s)]
*  It's fun, man. I mean, it's so much fun. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6215.0s)]
*  Oh, is it somebody watching it? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6217.0s)]
*  So here it is, yeah. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6219.0s)]
*  So these people were like... [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6221.0s)]
*  Yeah, here it is. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6223.0s)]
*  So see they got sensors on their legs and their shins [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6225.0s)]
*  and stuff like that? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6227.0s)]
*  You know, I used to be a regular... [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6229.0s)]
*  Because you know, the Call of Duty and the Halo. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6231.0s)]
*  I used to play that kind of stuff. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6233.0s)]
*  But this would really be good [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6235.0s)]
*  training practice [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6237.0s)]
*  better than shadow boxing for sure. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6239.0s)]
*  Because you could do the same kind of stuff [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6241.0s)]
*  that you could do with shadow boxing, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6243.0s)]
*  but you could do it against [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6245.0s)]
*  an opponent with no consequences. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6247.0s)]
*  It's not good to develop defense. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6249.0s)]
*  But in terms of developing technique, [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6251.0s)]
*  it sounds like a really fucking good idea. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6253.0s)]
*  It's cardio workout, too. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6255.0s)]
*  Oh, you can get a workout with that. My wife went through a couple of them. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6257.0s)]
*  She used to do the boxing one with the workout [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6259.0s)]
*  where you're punching the glowing balls type of shit. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6261.0s)]
*  She went through two fucking headsets. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6265.0s)]
*  It got drenched. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6267.0s)]
*  It seems like you could take some things if you wanted to do Muay Thai [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6269.0s)]
*  where you put on some things that just go down the side of your leg. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6271.0s)]
*  And it attaches to your ankle, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6275.0s)]
*  it attaches to where your knee is. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6277.0s)]
*  So it knows where your knees are going, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6279.0s)]
*  it knows where your ankles are going, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6281.0s)]
*  it knows where you're getting hit. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6283.0s)]
*  But then you'd have to do it too for your elbows too if you were throwing elbows. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6285.0s)]
*  Yeah, you'd have to do it on your elbows. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6287.0s)]
*  Oh, this is wild. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6289.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6291.0s)]
*  This guy's got a giant. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6293.0s)]
*  That's not really... [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6295.0s)]
*  But it's also, it's like, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6297.0s)]
*  you need at least a dummy down there. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6299.0s)]
*  You'd want to do that with a dummy. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6301.0s)]
*  But you know, you're not going to resist. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6303.0s)]
*  You'll be seeing something. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6305.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you want to feel it, right? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6307.0s)]
*  You're just doing this in the air. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6309.0s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6311.0s)]
*  But the striking in the air is legit. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6313.0s)]
*  I think that could, you really could learn some shit from that. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6315.0s)]
*  I didn't play the Creed one. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6317.0s)]
*  They got some stuff. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6319.0s)]
*  But as far as shooters, the population one, [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6321.0s)]
*  I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to them. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6323.0s)]
*  Hey, you fucker! [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6325.0s)]
*  Don't try to put me in a locker, you cocksucker! [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6327.0s)]
*  Dude, I used to have a real addiction to Quake. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6329.0s)]
*  I remember you saying that. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6331.0s)]
*  What is Quake? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6333.0s)]
*  Quake is an online, yeah, very similar. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6335.0s)]
*  First person shooter, you're running around shooting rockets at people. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6337.0s)]
*  It's too addictive. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6339.0s)]
*  He was the Halo King back in the day. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6341.0s)]
*  I used to love to travel with that place. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6343.0s)]
*  Once I did this one time, I started with the Vive, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6345.0s)]
*  and then now the Oculus Quest. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6347.0s)]
*  I can't talk to you guys! [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6349.0s)]
*  People out here are listening, they want to know about this. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6351.0s)]
*  It keeps me out of trouble. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6353.0s)]
*  I bring it with me everywhere, I put it in my carry-on, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6355.0s)]
*  and it's so much fucking fun. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6357.0s)]
*  I can't go back to regular video games after doing the Oculus Quest. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6359.0s)]
*  It's very immersive. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6361.0s)]
*  Well, that's why I don't do it, because I have one too, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6363.0s)]
*  and I used to play the little zombie game. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6365.0s)]
*  I'm not a zombie. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6367.0s)]
*  I'm a zombie. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6369.0s)]
*  I'm a zombie. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6371.0s)]
*  I used to play the little zombie game. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6373.0s)]
*  I mean, it was too fun. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6375.0s)]
*  So I was like, I can't do this too much. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6377.0s)]
*  Listen, man, I get some dopamine, man. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6379.0s)]
*  I'm like fucking yelling. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6381.0s)]
*  The worst was, my kids were doing the Zoom, right? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6383.0s)]
*  And they were at home doing it. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6385.0s)]
*  Now they're homeschooled too. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6387.0s)]
*  And you're in the background. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6389.0s)]
*  Oh, it was bad. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6391.0s)]
*  They're gone now. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6393.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't fucking see him! [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6395.0s)]
*  I don't fucking see him! Where is he? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6397.0s)]
*  My wife comes in, and she's like, they hear you! [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6399.0s)]
*  I'm like, sorry. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6401.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6403.0s)]
*  But it is a lot of fun. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6405.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6407.0s)]
*  Imagine being that teacher. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6409.0s)]
*  Shoot him! Shoot him! [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6411.0s)]
*  Shoot him in the background. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6413.0s)]
*  Send the people to my house. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6415.0s)]
*  But it's just, listen, good, clean fun. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6417.0s)]
*  Back in the day, people would probably get the same kind of [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6419.0s)]
*  thrill doing, I mean, listen, I'm not shit on paintball [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6421.0s)]
*  and shit like that, but I get my adrenaline up with this shit. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6423.0s)]
*  I'm like, I'm not fucking with you. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6425.0s)]
*  I'm not fucking with you. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6427.0s)]
*  I'm not adrenaline up with this shit. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6429.0s)]
*  Alright, let's switch the subject. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6431.0s)]
*  Everybody's just fucking saying, wow, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6433.0s)]
*  he had us. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6435.0s)]
*  Let me ask you guys, what do you think about [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6437.0s)]
*  this upcoming Yair Rodriguez [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6439.0s)]
*  Volkonovsky fight? [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6441.0s)]
*  That's a wild fight. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6443.0s)]
*  Obviously Volkonovsky's going to be the big favorite. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6445.0s)]
*  He's the big favorite. But Yair got that danger [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6447.0s)]
*  factor, man. A couple bodykicks [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6449.0s)]
*  to slow down Volkonovsky. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6451.0s)]
*  And it comes from everywhere. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6453.0s)]
*  It's hard to go against Volkonovsky [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6455.0s)]
*  just because of what this guy, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6457.0s)]
*  I mean, I thought he beat Islam too. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6459.0s)]
*  And Max, I thought, would retire [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6461.0s)]
*  at that weight class and he beat him three times. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6463.0s)]
*  Not once, not twice. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6465.0s)]
*  And the last time was very, that's what made [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6467.0s)]
*  me a true believer, the third one. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6469.0s)]
*  The last one, I mean, he just keeps getting better. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6471.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what you saw in the Islam [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6473.0s)]
*  fight too. He just keeps getting better. He's not [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6475.0s)]
*  even in his prime. I mean, he's in his prime, but [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6477.0s)]
*  I don't think he's at his full potential yet. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6479.0s)]
*  I was there live the second Max fight. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6481.0s)]
*  I remember thinking Max won. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6483.0s)]
*  I thought he won the second one. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6485.0s)]
*  But since then, I feel he's [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6487.0s)]
*  upped his level. He's gotten better since then. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6489.0s)]
*  He's pulled away. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6491.0s)]
*  But Yair Rodriguez is [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6493.0s)]
*  one of the most exciting guys you watch. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6495.0s)]
*  He does wild shit, man. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6497.0s)]
*  And that crazy elbow. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6499.0s)]
*  Everything with the Korean Zombie. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6501.0s)]
*  It's just so hard to deal with those kicks and he keeps [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6503.0s)]
*  getting better. When he submitted [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6505.0s)]
*  Josh in that last fight, I was like, wow. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6507.0s)]
*  He looked amazing. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6509.0s)]
*  He looked so good on the feet too even before that. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6511.0s)]
*  But ultimately, I think [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6513.0s)]
*  Volkanovsky, I think his ground and pound [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6515.0s)]
*  is underrated. Underrated. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6517.0s)]
*  It's phenomenal. Everything he does is [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6519.0s)]
*  phenomenal. He's underrated totally. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6521.0s)]
*  Everything he does. I mean, I think he still [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6523.0s)]
*  should be the pound for pound best. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6525.0s)]
*  Because if you look at it, I mean, he did go up [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6527.0s)]
*  a weight class and arguably, in many [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6529.0s)]
*  people's eyes, should have got the nod. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6531.0s)]
*  But at the very least, it was [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6533.0s)]
*  as close to a draw [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6535.0s)]
*  as you're going to get in a world championship [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6537.0s)]
*  fight. And then [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6539.0s)]
*  he went up. He went up in weight class. Isn't that what [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6541.0s)]
*  pound for pound is all about? 100%. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6543.0s)]
*  So I feel like, you know, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6545.0s)]
*  I mean, it was an amazing fight all around. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6547.0s)]
*  But I feel like that's the [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6549.0s)]
*  pound for pound. I'm wondering if his performance [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6551.0s)]
*  against Islam will make [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6553.0s)]
*  other fighters now, don't, he's [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6555.0s)]
*  not so invincible anymore. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6557.0s)]
*  Perhaps. So maybe you don't go [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6559.0s)]
*  in with that mystique and maybe [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6561.0s)]
*  somebody else goes in there and shows [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6563.0s)]
*  his humans. But dude, that squeeze [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6565.0s)]
*  is out of this world. Sometimes those smaller [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6567.0s)]
*  guys are harder to finish than even bigger guys. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6569.0s)]
*  Stop trying to take up for short people. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6571.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6573.0s)]
*  I [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6575.0s)]
*  remember the first time you walked [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6577.0s)]
*  into the academy [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6579.0s)]
*  like the fucking creature [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6581.0s)]
*  from the deep. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6583.0s)]
*  And I'm going to HENZO. Put [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6585.0s)]
*  me with him. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6587.0s)]
*  My first day, he pulled you off teaching [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6589.0s)]
*  so you could help me with my private. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6591.0s)]
*  At the old karate school. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6593.0s)]
*  And we've been buddies ever since. 100%. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6595.0s)]
*  100%. It's my man. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6597.0s)]
*  It's fucking great. That was at 25th Street. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6599.0s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6601.0s)]
*  Let me see the rest of that card, Jamie. Who else is on? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6603.0s)]
*  Pantoja's fighting Brandon Moreno. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6605.0s)]
*  That's an awesome fight. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6607.0s)]
*  Whitaker and Duplassie. That's interesting. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6609.0s)]
*  I thought they were going to go straight Duplassie [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6611.0s)]
*  to Izzy. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6613.0s)]
*  Considering that Izzy's [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6615.0s)]
*  beat Robert Whitaker twice. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6617.0s)]
*  And then Duplassie [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6619.0s)]
*  and him have a problem with each other. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6621.0s)]
*  Battle of Africa. Yeah. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6623.0s)]
*  They should have made that fight. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6625.0s)]
*  I thought they would have. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6627.0s)]
*  It was interesting. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6629.0s)]
*  But I get it. If you can get past Whitaker. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6631.0s)]
*  Goddamn Whitaker's good. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6633.0s)]
*  Whitaker's very good. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6635.0s)]
*  I think he's something like 12 and 0 [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6637.0s)]
*  as a middleweight against anybody not [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6639.0s)]
*  named out of sight. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6641.0s)]
*  Turner, he's a stud too. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6643.0s)]
*  Jaylin Turner's going to beat up Dan Hooker. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6645.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. I think so too. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6647.0s)]
*  Bo Nicol. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6649.0s)]
*  Always love to see the wrestlers out there. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6651.0s)]
*  He's a special talent. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6653.0s)]
*  Bo Nicol fighting another black guy [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6655.0s)]
*  who can't wrestle. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6657.0s)]
*  You got to build him up. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6659.0s)]
*  You got to build him up. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6661.0s)]
*  Do you know the guy he's fighting? [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6663.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6665.0s)]
*  Is this his first time in the UFC? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6667.0s)]
*  No. He was on [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6669.0s)]
*  the Contender Series. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6671.0s)]
*  In defense of Bo, he's new. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6673.0s)]
*  You can't just throw him to the dogs [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6675.0s)]

*  with the body. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6709.0s)]

*  To Bilal. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6727.0s)]
*  And you know, Bilal is on [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6729.0s)]

*  Bilal's really coming into his own. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6733.0s)]
*  He's such a nice guy, Bilal. He's a great guy. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6735.0s)]
*  He won't even swear. He would say, what the fudge? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6737.0s)]
*  Like on the podcast. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6739.0s)]

*  guys that was so close, right? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6763.0s)]
*  Think about when he had that fight [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6765.0s)]
*  with Dustin Poirier. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6767.0s)]

*  Down to the wire. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6771.0s)]
*  So close. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6773.0s)]
*  I don't want to take anything away from him, but I think Jaylen Turner, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6775.0s)]
*  especially after losing his [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6777.0s)]
*  last fight, I think that taught him a lot. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6779.0s)]
*  Sharanjua. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6781.0s)]
*  Who did he lose to in his last fight? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6783.0s)]
*  Mateo's Gamrot. And he had him in trouble. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6785.0s)]
*  He had him in trouble. You know what I'm saying? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6787.0s)]
*  Mateo's Gamrot's a motherfuck. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6789.0s)]
*  That guy is game. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6791.0s)]
*  You know who has a win over Jaylen? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6793.0s)]
*  Matt's Demirola Favola. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6795.0s)]
*  Oh, he does. He does. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6797.0s)]
*  Not just giving him a shout out because he's our guy. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6799.0s)]
*  He's an exciting motherfucker, Mattie. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6801.0s)]
*  Mattie's so exciting. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6803.0s)]

*  that, I mean, every one of his fights [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6807.0s)]
*  is fucking amazing. His fight versus the [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6809.0s)]
*  Durantulo's fight. How about the Dober knockout? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6811.0s)]
*  I mean, I probably should give him an apology [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6813.0s)]
*  for him knocking out Dober because I didn't think [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6815.0s)]
*  that was going to happen. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6817.0s)]
*  He's no joke. Listen, he's got the balls [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6819.0s)]
*  to trigger. Yeah, he's very game. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6821.0s)]
*  He's very gung-ho. Very game. And he's very [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6823.0s)]
*  powerful. Yeah. And [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6825.0s)]
*  he's another sweet heart of a guy. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6827.0s)]
*  Great guy. Great guy. He knew [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6829.0s)]
*  my friend Dave Dolan. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6831.0s)]
*  We had a mutual friend who was like the funniest [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6833.0s)]
*  guy I ever met in my life. He was my boss [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6835.0s)]
*  at one point in time. I was a private [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6837.0s)]
*  investigator's assistant when I was 21. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6839.0s)]
*  And really it was, my friend Dave [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6841.0s)]
*  lost his driver's license drinking [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6843.0s)]
*  and driving. He needed someone to drive him. So I [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6845.0s)]
*  drove with him until he got [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6847.0s)]
*  his driver's license back. So I'd have to pick him up [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6849.0s)]
*  and take him to people's houses when they were doing [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6851.0s)]
*  insurance fraud and shit. It was mostly [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6853.0s)]
*  like, he was a private investigator [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6855.0s)]
*  investigating, like, you know, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6857.0s)]
*  mostly fraud. But occasionally [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6859.0s)]
*  there was some like chick who was [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6861.0s)]
*  cheating on the guy and that kind of [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6863.0s)]
*  stuff. So we, I [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6865.0s)]
*  met this guy, Dave [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6867.0s)]
*  Dolan, who was like the fucking funniest guy [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6869.0s)]
*  I've ever met in my life, who never wanted to do stand-up [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6871.0s)]
*  comedy. And he [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6873.0s)]
*  told me about this Matt Favola guy. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6875.0s)]
*  He goes, you gotta look out for my boy, Matt [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6877.0s)]
*  Favola. He's a fucking goer. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6879.0s)]
*  I remember [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6881.0s)]
*  the first time I met Favola, we talked [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6883.0s)]
*  about this guy. He'd run up dying. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6885.0s)]
*  Oh no. Yeah, sad. Sad. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6887.0s)]
*  But fucking [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6889.0s)]
*  amazing person. Just like, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6891.0s)]
*  there's some dudes, you know how like there's some dudes [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6893.0s)]
*  in the early days of, you know, training [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6895.0s)]
*  were like, they're so talented. Like [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6897.0s)]
*  this guy could be a world champion. And then they just drift [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6899.0s)]
*  off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That dude [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6901.0s)]
*  was so fucking funny. Like when I [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6903.0s)]
*  drifted off, huh? He just never wanted to do comedy. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6905.0s)]
*  And his cousin owned [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6907.0s)]
*  the comedy connection in Boston. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6909.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6911.0s)]
*  What a funniest people I've ever met. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6913.0s)]
*  Just a habit. Yeah. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6915.0s)]
*  That's the talent [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6917.0s)]
*  without fucking, what do they say that? Wasted talent [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6919.0s)]
*  is fucking, there's a saying [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6921.0s)]
*  somewhere with that. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6923.0s)]
*  There's nothing worse than wasted talent. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6925.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's like that with fighting [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6927.0s)]
*  too though. For sure. The guys might have the [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6929.0s)]
*  skills, but they don't got the fucking [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6931.0s)]
*  dedication or else, you know, it doesn't happen [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6933.0s)]
*  overnight either. Or the mindset too. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6935.0s)]
*  Some guys just say fuck it, I'll get a real job. And we were talking about that last night. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6937.0s)]
*  How you have so many of these guys in the gym that [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6939.0s)]
*  are straight up killers, like beaten guys you [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6941.0s)]
*  see on TV, but when you put the lights [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6943.0s)]
*  on, it's [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6945.0s)]
*  tough. That's gym fight, that's academy fight. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6947.0s)]
*  There's also guys that get like one [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6949.0s)]
*  injury and they never recover from it. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6951.0s)]
*  One thing goes wrong and they just [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6953.0s)]
*  never, never snap back. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6955.0s)]
*  You know, there's like certain things that just [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6957.0s)]
*  compromise your movement, like a neck thing or [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6959.0s)]
*  a back thing. They get it operated on, [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6961.0s)]
*  they're never the same. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6963.0s)]
*  Like Kane's a good example of that, right? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6965.0s)]
*  Like Kane Velasquez, his body [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6967.0s)]
*  just started failing on him. His shoulders started going, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6969.0s)]
*  knees started going. Remember he was always injured. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6971.0s)]
*  King Mo, that happened to King Mo too. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6973.0s)]
*  King Mo was a killer. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6975.0s)]
*  Killer. Killer. And as soon as he started getting injured, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6977.0s)]
*  like his knees went. Remember he knocked out [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6979.0s)]
*  Hodger? Yeah. He knocked out [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6981.0s)]
*  Yuri. Yeah. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6983.0s)]
*  Is Kane [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6985.0s)]
*  gonna be, is he out of trouble with all that stuff? [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6987.0s)]
*  I'm sure he's gonna go through some stuff. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6989.0s)]
*  Who knows? I felt so bad for him. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6991.0s)]
*  The whole thing is so evil that the guy who did [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6993.0s)]
*  that was out on the street. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6995.0s)]
*  Kane was crazy. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6997.0s)]
*  Sometimes the world just seems backwards [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=6999.0s)]
*  lately with a lot of things, you know? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7001.0s)]
*  You think of stuff like that. It's nice to [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7003.0s)]
*  see Kane coaching. I know, that's nice. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7005.0s)]
*  And AKA. Yeah. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7007.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what the legal [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7009.0s)]
*  status is, but it's a horrible, horrible, [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7011.0s)]
*  horrible fucking story. Yeah, you can't [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7013.0s)]
*  blame it at all. No, it's what [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7015.0s)]
*  every father says they would do. Every father [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7017.0s)]
*  says they would do that. He just went out and actually [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7019.0s)]
*  fucking did it and he lost his mind. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7021.0s)]
*  And he's such a soft-spoken guy. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7023.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? He's such a sweet guy. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7025.0s)]
*  The nicest fucking guy. Other than that. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7027.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7029.0s)]
*  Yeah. When he was in his prime, dude, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7031.0s)]
*  before he was injured, god damn, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7033.0s)]
*  he was a force of nature. And the beat down he put on [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7035.0s)]
*  JDS? Yeah. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7037.0s)]
*  The cardio he had for that heavy [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7039.0s)]
*  brock lesnery. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7041.0s)]
*  And for a guy with a wrestler base, his standup [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7043.0s)]
*  was legit. Sharp. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7045.0s)]
*  And no wasted motion. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7047.0s)]
*  It wasn't like big haymaker punches. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7049.0s)]
*  Everything was clean and crisp and coming [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7051.0s)]
*  in combinations. When he knocked out Minotauro, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7053.0s)]
*  it was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7055.0s)]
*  It was like, woof. Kane Velasquez [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7057.0s)]
*  in his prime was a motherfucker. That's like [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7059.0s)]
*  one of the great missed opportunities. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7061.0s)]
*  Kane in his prime versus Fedor in his prime. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7063.0s)]
*  Because they were real close. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7065.0s)]
*  It was real close. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7067.0s)]
*  It was real close. Show up everywhere. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7069.0s)]
*  Did that guy retire yet? Who? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7071.0s)]
*  Fedor? I don't know if he did. I think he fought [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7073.0s)]
*  again recently, right? I think he did too. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7075.0s)]
*  I think he won his last one. Nah, he didn't win. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7077.0s)]
*  He lost again? Jesus, man. He definitely lost. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7079.0s)]
*  What is wrong? Was it with Bader? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7081.0s)]
*  Did Bader beat him? Yeah, I think you're [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7083.0s)]
*  right, man. Bader KO'd him and then [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7085.0s)]
*  Bader, did Bader just beat him again? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7087.0s)]
*  I think Bader beat him again. I think he beat him again. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7089.0s)]
*  I don't... Yeah, I mean, it's [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7091.0s)]
*  there's a... What's he keep running out [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7093.0s)]
*  there for? He's got nothing to prove. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7095.0s)]
*  I think maybe he likes it. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7097.0s)]
*  I think some guys have a trouble transitioning [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7099.0s)]
*  into the other part of their life. TKO, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7101.0s)]
*  230, round one. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7103.0s)]
*  You just don't... Thank God I left [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7105.0s)]
*  the sport in my chin. Some guys, they leave [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7107.0s)]
*  that sport, they leave the chin in there with them. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7109.0s)]
*  You can only get... I mean, look at what happened to your [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7111.0s)]
*  jaw, that one tough man fight. Now, [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7113.0s)]
*  imagine the fights that Fedor's had. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7115.0s)]
*  Imagine those crow-cop fights. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7117.0s)]
*  Imagine crow-cop [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7119.0s)]
*  danging you in the chin over and [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7121.0s)]
*  over again. Imagine all those [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7123.0s)]
*  fights he had. Bigfoot... It seems once that button [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7125.0s)]
*  gets pushed, it's easier to push. But I tell you what though, when Fedor was in his [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7127.0s)]
*  prime, I was with Jeff Munson in Russia [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7129.0s)]
*  when Fedor fought him. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7131.0s)]
*  And I remember Jeff Munson walking out that [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7133.0s)]
*  tunnel, and it looked like a man was walking [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7135.0s)]
*  to his execution. Oh my God. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7137.0s)]
*  And he beat the hell [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7139.0s)]
*  out of Jeff Munson. He broke his femur. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7141.0s)]
*  Oh Jesus. Yeah, it was [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7143.0s)]
*  the worst beating. Good with a leg kick? Yeah, it was [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7145.0s)]
*  the worst beating I've ever seen a human being take. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7147.0s)]
*  Oh, let me see that. That's [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7149.0s)]
*  pretty crazy. Oh my God. He beat the [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7151.0s)]
*  hell out of Jeff. He broke his femur. He beat the hell... [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7153.0s)]
*  Jeff couldn't walk after that. He beat the hell out of Jeff [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7155.0s)]
*  Munson. Oh, I remember that. I remember being [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7157.0s)]
*  horrific. I didn't know he broke his femur [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7159.0s)]
*  though. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7161.0s)]
*  This was Fedor in his prime, man. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7163.0s)]
*  And what was this for? What organization [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7165.0s)]
*  was this for? I don't even remember. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7167.0s)]
*  Oh, M1. Oh, M1. Yeah. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7169.0s)]
*  So this was right around the [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7171.0s)]
*  time where they were negotiating [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7173.0s)]
*  with Fedor to come to the [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7175.0s)]
*  UFC. Because Fedor [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7177.0s)]
*  and his representatives [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7179.0s)]
*  met with the UFC at one point in time, [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7181.0s)]
*  and like many points in time, and there was like [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7183.0s)]
*  some real, you know, heated discussions, and [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7185.0s)]
*  it became a bit of an issue. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7189.0s)]
*  Like, this is Fedor in his prime. God damn [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7191.0s)]
*  he looked good. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7193.0s)]
*  How tough is Munson though? He just [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7195.0s)]
*  eats his... He was shooting and pulling guard. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7197.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, is Munson [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7199.0s)]
*  still doing it? Fedor is just [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7201.0s)]
*  taking off on him. He might be. I mean, he lives [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7203.0s)]
*  in Russia now, right? Oh my God. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7205.0s)]
*  God damn Munson could [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7207.0s)]
*  take a shot. I mean, look, he's built like [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7209.0s)]
*  a tank, but the fucking shots [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7211.0s)]
*  he's eaten from arguably [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7213.0s)]
*  the heavyweight goat. Oh, man. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7215.0s)]
*  I mean, other than John Jones, I would have [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7217.0s)]
*  loved to see Fedor versus John Jones. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7219.0s)]
*  But other than [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7221.0s)]
*  John Jones... Imagine if Fedor fought [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7223.0s)]
*  205 where he belonged. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7225.0s)]
*  This guy was fighting heavyweights. No shit. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7227.0s)]
*  I don't think he believes in cutting too much weight. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7229.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think that [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7231.0s)]
*  probably also led to his durability. Yeah. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7233.0s)]
*  You know? There I go right there. You see me on the little corner? [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7235.0s)]
*  Fedor was crazy [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7237.0s)]
*  durable. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7239.0s)]
*  I mean, when he walked down [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7241.0s)]
*  Cro Cop in that fight, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7243.0s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. Like, this guy [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7245.0s)]
*  is, you know, you've known him as a [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7247.0s)]
*  Sambo guy. And here he [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7249.0s)]
*  is. He's walking down one [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7251.0s)]
*  of the greatest kickboxers that's ever competed [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7253.0s)]
*  in MMA. That's how talented [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7255.0s)]
*  that guy was. He's got a little belly too. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7257.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Always had a belly. Had the dad [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7259.0s)]
*  bod going. Always had that body. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7261.0s)]
*  I mean, never was ripped ever. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7263.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7265.0s)]
*  Didn't matter a little bit either what he [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7267.0s)]
*  looked like. He was a bad motherfucker [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7269.0s)]
*  dude. So those Minotauro [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7271.0s)]
*  fights. Oh, stop Minotauro. Those are [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7273.0s)]

*  But for MMA, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7539.0s)]
*  though, a lot of people make the argument that [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7541.0s)]
*  combat Sambo style is [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7543.0s)]
*  probably even better with striking. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7545.0s)]
*  You know what the problem is? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7547.0s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu is like now [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7549.0s)]
*  what Taekwondo was back in the day. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7551.0s)]
*  And it just like went in this different [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7553.0s)]
*  direction. So now [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7555.0s)]
*  it kind of went away from where [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7557.0s)]
*  we are in MMA. The competition direction. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7559.0s)]
*  Right. The competition direction. Even someone [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7561.0s)]
*  who just does a competition Jiu Jitsu [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7563.0s)]
*  they never did any kind of distance [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7565.0s)]
*  management and stuff like that. They'll [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7567.0s)]
*  still strangle the fuck out of [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7569.0s)]
*  your average people. And they'll still be able to [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7571.0s)]
*  defend themselves. It's still better than the [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7573.0s)]
*  majority of fucking other [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7575.0s)]

*  which kind of competitors you're talking about. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7579.0s)]

*  like that little motherfucker is an assassin. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7583.0s)]
*  He's coming to close the show [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7585.0s)]
*  on you. He's not trying to win on points. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7587.0s)]
*  That dude is always trying to close the show. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7589.0s)]
*  He's a spooky kid. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7591.0s)]
*  Because you're never going to catch up. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7593.0s)]
*  He's a great man of Jiu Jitsu. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7595.0s)]
*  100%. He's training 12 hours a day. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7597.0s)]
*  Every fucking day and only eating once. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7599.0s)]
*  He's eating pizzas and pasta. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7601.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7603.0s)]
*  They see that thing with the Sambo [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7605.0s)]
*  and them saying that it's better for [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7607.0s)]
*  combat sports, mixed martial arts and stuff. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7611.0s)]
*  When you look at the arts [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7613.0s)]
*  as a whole, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7615.0s)]
*  you know, the wrestlings, they can say the same [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7617.0s)]
*  thing for wrestling. But [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7619.0s)]
*  what if you meet a bigger wrestler? [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7621.0s)]
*  In other words, the thing about Jiu Jitsu is [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7623.0s)]
*  the self-defense aspect of it. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7625.0s)]
*  What about the defense? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7627.0s)]
*  This fight's where [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7629.0s)]
*  like Picaro for instance, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7631.0s)]
*  man I had nothing in a tank. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7633.0s)]
*  I was so shot. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7635.0s)]
*  I got to show a nice fucking armlock escape. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7637.0s)]
*  I got to show a nice, I don't know if they have similar [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7639.0s)]
*  defenses and escapes. When I had [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7641.0s)]
*  zero in the tank, I made it to the, I ended up [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7643.0s)]
*  on top of him with an escape. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7645.0s)]
*  And I'm talking about nothing in the tank. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7647.0s)]
*  So Jiu Jitsu served me not only as [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7649.0s)]
*  the hammer, but when I was being the [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7651.0s)]
*  fucking nail. And it stopped me from ever [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7653.0s)]
*  having to say uncle in there. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7655.0s)]
*  Where if I didn't have [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7657.0s)]
*  the defensive part of Jiu Jitsu, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7659.0s)]
*  the technique, [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7661.0s)]
*  not just the offensive part, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7663.0s)]
*  you know I would have been fucked. I would have tapped out. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7665.0s)]
*  Can I ask you something right now? Are you rolling right now? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7667.0s)]
*  Oh 100%. What are you doing with those claws? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7669.0s)]
*  Look at those claws. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7671.0s)]
*  You know what's funny about that? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7673.0s)]
*  You know what's funny about that? [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7675.0s)]
*  You know what's funny about that? [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7677.0s)]
*  I saw that shit this morning and I was going to [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7679.0s)]
*  get this, go look for a nail clipper. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7681.0s)]
*  How do you let them get that long? [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7683.0s)]
*  It grows quick man. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7685.0s)]
*  I'll never forget. I was with [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7687.0s)]
*  Bruce Puffer [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7689.0s)]
*  in Hawaii. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7691.0s)]
*  And he goes, I was asking, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7693.0s)]
*  he's a little bit older, Bruce Puffer. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7695.0s)]
*  And he was saying, oh well, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7697.0s)]
*  he was talking about the hair. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7699.0s)]
*  Because I do that too a lot. I'm always fucking [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7701.0s)]
*  trimming the nose hair and the fucking ear hair. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7703.0s)]
*  As you get older, shit just comes out. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7705.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? They're fucking [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7707.0s)]
*  fingernails. They grow normal speed. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7709.0s)]
*  So what the fuck do you want from me? You have an extra [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7711.0s)]
*  clipper? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7713.0s)]
*  Do you want to go to a fucking salon now? [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7715.0s)]
*  Jamie, look up the nearest salon. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7717.0s)]
*  I always had some claws too. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7719.0s)]
*  Are you rolling with those? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7721.0s)]
*  Did he really? Yeah man. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7723.0s)]
*  I normally am better than this, but you know. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7725.0s)]
*  That is shitty. I got an infection [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7727.0s)]
*  once, some dudes pulling my [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7729.0s)]
*  hooks out. I haven't clawed anybody recently. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7731.0s)]
*  Accidentally clawed me and it got infected. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7733.0s)]
*  So now you probably [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7735.0s)]

*  A lot of that is due to the people, man. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7753.0s)]
*  They got to just take a shower. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7755.0s)]
*  Take a shower. Clean your gear. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7757.0s)]
*  Whenever shit's going down [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7759.0s)]
*  like that, because I wash my mats after [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7761.0s)]

*  Do you take acidophilus or any [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7785.0s)]
*  probiotics or something like that? That's supposed to help. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7787.0s)]

*  I thought that would cure any of my stomach trouble, but [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7813.0s)]
*  no cure yet. I have a feeling if you tried [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7815.0s)]

*  It's so disgusting. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7889.0s)]
*  She goes into the sink. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7891.0s)]
*  One of them is throwing up in the bowl. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7893.0s)]
*  The other girl puts her ass in the sink. She's shit in the sink. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7895.0s)]
*  And she's like, look away! [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7897.0s)]
*  Look away! [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7899.0s)]
*  It was fucking great. But ever since [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7901.0s)]
*  then, man, I wonder [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7903.0s)]
*  if they took a hit with that. I always remember that fucking scene. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7905.0s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7907.0s)]
*  Some bad meat. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7909.0s)]
*  I do like that Fogo place. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7911.0s)]
*  I hadn't been there in a minute, so it was good to go. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7913.0s)]
*  You know where most people get food poisoning from? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7915.0s)]
*  Salad. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7917.0s)]
*  That's why we don't eat it. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7919.0s)]
*  You make fun of me. No rabbit food. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7921.0s)]
*  I read that once. It might be bullshit. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7923.0s)]
*  Let's make sure it's true. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7925.0s)]
*  Because someone told me it's like people that don't wash their hands [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7927.0s)]
*  when they're handling salad. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7929.0s)]
*  And you get bacteria. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7931.0s)]
*  Think about it. It's not cooked. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7933.0s)]
*  Especially if you're not cleaning the leaves. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7935.0s)]
*  Someone told me that that's a [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7937.0s)]
*  I think salad's fucking disgusting. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7939.0s)]
*  I just don't like it. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7941.0s)]
*  Survival food. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7943.0s)]
*  I used to eat broccoli when I was getting the [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7945.0s)]
*  155. Fresh salads are another [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7947.0s)]
*  top source of food poisoning. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7949.0s)]
*  But pinpointing the cause can be tricky. Some outbreaks [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7951.0s)]
*  are tied to a specific kind of greens. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7953.0s)]
*  Often romaine, lettuce, and spinach. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7955.0s)]
*  Or to certain growers or packers. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7957.0s)]
*  Salmonella or other bacteria can be traced [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7959.0s)]
*  to dirty irrigation water, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7961.0s)]
*  soil, or human hands. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7963.0s)]
*  A lot of people get that shit. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7965.0s)]
*  But I think they get it from a lot of other things too. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7967.0s)]
*  Don't eat rabbit food. And then again, you know how many people [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7969.0s)]
*  I've had. Salmonella from eggs? I did not know this. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7971.0s)]
*  Moby was talking about it. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7973.0s)]
*  Because Moby's a crazy vegan. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7975.0s)]
*  And he was talking about how you shouldn't eat eggs. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7977.0s)]
*  Eggs are like the most karma free food. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7979.0s)]
*  If you get pasture raised eggs, [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7981.0s)]
*  those chickens are just eating bugs [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7983.0s)]
*  and little grass and then they lay their eggs. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7985.0s)]
*  And as long as there's no rooster, that's never going to be a chick. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7987.0s)]
*  It's just food. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7989.0s)]
*  I actually learned that here. I didn't know that they just laid eggs for y'all. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7991.0s)]
*  I didn't know until I had them. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7993.0s)]
*  I felt so stupid. I was 40. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7995.0s)]
*  I was like, this is how dumb I am. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7997.0s)]
*  I'm like, how could it? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=7999.0s)]
*  I'm like, Jesus Christ, I know biology. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8001.0s)]
*  In my mind, an egg, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8003.0s)]
*  they lay the egg, it must be there's a chicken there. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8005.0s)]
*  No. It's just eggs. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8007.0s)]
*  They lay eggs every day. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8009.0s)]
*  When you have healthy chickens, especially when they're young, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8011.0s)]
*  they'll lay eggs almost every day. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8013.0s)]
*  I don't even need fucking eggs. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8015.0s)]
*  I had 19 chickens at one point, Tom. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8017.0s)]
*  I was eating fresh eggs every day. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8019.0s)]
*  I need to get some chickens. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8021.0s)]
*  I'm telling you. It's great. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8023.0s)]
*  You give them chicken feed, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8025.0s)]
*  but they also eat worms. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8027.0s)]
*  They eat the fucking shit out of mice. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8029.0s)]
*  If they catch a mouse, they will fuck that mouse up. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8031.0s)]
*  The chicken? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8033.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8035.0s)]
*  You've never seen it? No. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8037.0s)]
*  We've showed many people, unfortunately, if you're watching this at home, [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8039.0s)]
*  you're going to have to watch it again. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8041.0s)]
*  Watch a cat is playing with this mouse. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8043.0s)]
*  The cat is just letting them out. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8045.0s)]
*  The chicken runs over, give me that bitch. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8047.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8049.0s)]
*  Steals the fucking mouse from the cat, [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8051.0s)]
*  and the chicken fucks that mouse up. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8053.0s)]
*  The cat is playing with it, and the chicken is observing. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8055.0s)]
*  It's like, bitch, you ain't even doing nothing. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8057.0s)]
*  The chicken is like, give me that. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8059.0s)]
*  It just steals it from them. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8061.0s)]
*  It fucks up that mouse. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8063.0s)]
*  They eat them. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8065.0s)]
*  They eat them ferociously. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8067.0s)]
*  We had a mouse in our chicken coop, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8069.0s)]
*  and one chicken ran off with it, [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8071.0s)]
*  and the other ones are chasing her and trying to steal it from her mouth. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8073.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8075.0s)]
*  I saw a video of a deer eating a snake. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8077.0s)]
*  It was one of those types. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8079.0s)]
*  Deers eat birds all the time. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8081.0s)]
*  Ground nesting birds. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8083.0s)]
*  I get my education on here. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8085.0s)]
*  I heard that one here as well. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8087.0s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8089.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8091.0s)]
*  They'll eat snakes. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8093.0s)]
*  They'll also eat ground nesting birds. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8095.0s)]
*  They'll find birds that can't move good, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8097.0s)]
*  and they'll eat them. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8099.0s)]
*  Cows do that too sometimes. [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8101.0s)]
*  There's videos of cows eating birds. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8103.0s)]
*  There was this bird net that they used [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8105.0s)]
*  to trap birds, [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8107.0s)]
*  a specific kind of birds. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8109.0s)]
*  That deer is just straight up eating a bird. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8111.0s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8113.0s)]
*  I thought they just ate god damn leaves. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8115.0s)]
*  Most of the time they do. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8117.0s)]
*  But if they have an opportunity to eat a little birdie, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8119.0s)]
*  don't chew that fucker down. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8121.0s)]
*  Survival of the fittest out there. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8123.0s)]
*  My father-in-law, Ciro, [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8125.0s)]
*  he's a hunter. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8127.0s)]
*  He makes me some deer meat. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8129.0s)]
*  The venison? [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8131.0s)]
*  It's my fucking favorite. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8133.0s)]
*  It's so delicious. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8135.0s)]
*  He makes it look just like a veal cutlet. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8137.0s)]
*  He breads it. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8139.0s)]
*  I heard people say that it's gamey or something. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8141.0s)]
*  Not the way he makes it. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8143.0s)]
*  It melts in my mouth. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8145.0s)]
*  It's also how you [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8147.0s)]
*  butcher the animal in the field. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8149.0s)]
*  A lot of times people don't know what they're doing. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8151.0s)]
*  They'll get the glands. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8153.0s)]
*  There's tarsal glands that are on these deer, [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8155.0s)]
*  especially when they're rutting, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8157.0s)]
*  which is when you're hunting them. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8159.0s)]
*  They're emitting scent from their glands. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8161.0s)]
*  If you get that scent on the meat, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8163.0s)]
*  it'll fuck the meat up. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8165.0s)]
*  I don't know what he does. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8167.0s)]
*  It's like a fear, right? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8169.0s)]
*  No, it's like their hormones. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8171.0s)]
*  They're letting out scent for other deer. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8173.0s)]
*  They're trying to fuck. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8175.0s)]
*  They're trying to fuck and they're trying to fight. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8177.0s)]
*  They're putting out their glands. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8179.0s)]
*  A lot of times people accidentally cut their glands [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8181.0s)]
*  when they're butchering the animal. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8183.0s)]
*  That shit will get on the meat. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8185.0s)]
*  Also, if you don't immediately cool the meat down, [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8187.0s)]
*  that's very important. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8189.0s)]
*  Right after you kill the animal, you have to butcher it [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8191.0s)]
*  and cool that meat down. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8193.0s)]
*  You don't want it outside being exposed to the heat. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8195.0s)]
*  You want it in a cool, dry place. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8197.0s)]
*  You want to get it on ice as quickly as possible. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8199.0s)]
*  However he did it, he did it like that. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8201.0s)]
*  Obviously he knows what he's doing. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8203.0s)]
*  It's fucking delicious. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8205.0s)]
*  Do you like it? [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8207.0s)]
*  I love it. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8209.0s)]
*  It's my favorite meat. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8211.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8213.0s)]
*  It's so rich in protein, too. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8215.0s)]
*  I feel powerful when I have it. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8217.0s)]
*  I feel like John Rallo. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8219.0s)]
*  The final boss. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8221.0s)]
*  It's great for you. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8223.0s)]
*  The problem with food is [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8225.0s)]
*  the shit that's the most delicious [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8227.0s)]
*  sometimes is not fucking good for you. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8229.0s)]
*  Like lasagna. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8231.0s)]
*  All that noodles are not fucking so good for you. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8233.0s)]
*  That amount of noodles. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8235.0s)]
*  Ravioli, gnocchi, tortellini. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8237.0s)]
*  Stuffed shells. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8239.0s)]
*  Send it my way. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8241.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8243.0s)]
*  Also, I overeat with that. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8245.0s)]
*  What I notice about the carnivore diet is [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8247.0s)]
*  when I'm done, I'm done. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8249.0s)]
*  When I'm only eating steak, I can only eat so much [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8251.0s)]
*  that I'm done. But if there was like mashed potatoes [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8253.0s)]
*  or spaghetti. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8255.0s)]
*  You don't eat mashed potatoes with steak? [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8257.0s)]
*  Just meat? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8259.0s)]
*  No greens or nothing? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8261.0s)]
*  Shit, man. Since I got a bad stomach [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8263.0s)]
*  it doesn't bother me so much. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8265.0s)]
*  I think my ulcerative colitis [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8267.0s)]
*  helps keep my weight down. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8269.0s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing, but it is what it is. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8271.0s)]
*  It keeps you from going crazy. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8273.0s)]
*  Yeah, because otherwise I'll just eat too much. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8275.0s)]
*  He's got natural [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8277.0s)]
*  semaglutide going on. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8279.0s)]
*  Natural semaglutide makes you sick. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8281.0s)]
*  That's a wild thing, huh? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8283.0s)]
*  Everybody's shooting up with this [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8285.0s)]
*  fucking diabetes drug [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8287.0s)]
*  to try to get skin. Really? Is that what's going on? [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8289.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. People just drop weight. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8291.0s)]
*  It kills your appetite and people [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8293.0s)]
*  drop weight without changing anything [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8295.0s)]
*  else. Also, you lose a lot of bone [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8297.0s)]
*  mass. I believe you gotta lose muscle [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8299.0s)]
*  tissue, everything with it. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8301.0s)]
*  Because you're just not taking in nutrition. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8303.0s)]
*  The body's gonna waste. Yeah, Peter Tia [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8305.0s)]
*  who's a friend of mine who's a doctor, he said he won't [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8307.0s)]
*  prescribe it to anybody unless they're weight training. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8309.0s)]
*  You have to be weight training while you're doing it. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8311.0s)]
*  Because you're losing, because [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8313.0s)]
*  when you're doing it, they show that people [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8315.0s)]
*  are losing weight, but gaining [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8317.0s)]
*  fat. So they're [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8319.0s)]
*  a higher percentage of body fat, even [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8321.0s)]
*  though their body was losing weight. So they're literally [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8323.0s)]
*  rotting out from the start. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8325.0s)]
*  Skinny fat's [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8327.0s)]
*  the worst. It's starving to death. When you're [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8329.0s)]
*  starving to death, when you're not eating enough, what [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8331.0s)]
*  happens? Your body starts to eat itself and you get smaller. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8333.0s)]
*  That's how I used to cut weight for fights. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8335.0s)]
*  Back in the day. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8337.0s)]
*  I mean, you know what I'm saying? [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8339.0s)]
*  Now they do it all scientifically. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8341.0s)]
*  You have the PI and all that. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8343.0s)]
*  Everybody's got a nutritionist, but back in the day, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8345.0s)]
*  that's how I used to cut it. How did you learn how to do it? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8347.0s)]
*  From wrestlers? Where'd you learn how to do it from? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8349.0s)]
*  Just figured it out. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8351.0s)]
*  I gotta be 145 [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8353.0s)]
*  pounds. How much did you have to cut? [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8355.0s)]
*  I would do 20 pounds like that. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8357.0s)]
*  Just not eating. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8359.0s)]
*  I didn't know what the fuck I was doing my first time. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8361.0s)]
*  That's probably why I tore my bicep. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8363.0s)]
*  I was getting dehydrated and [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8365.0s)]
*  I was sparring and [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8367.0s)]
*  I hit the guy wide and it went right off. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8369.0s)]
*  What was it? The Lanny fight, I think? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8371.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Lantey fight. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8373.0s)]
*  I remember I showed up for that [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8375.0s)]
*  with the weight. Yeah, I was fucked up. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8377.0s)]
*  I strangled him. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8379.0s)]
*  But I remember being there [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8381.0s)]
*  just not eating and people not looking at me good. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8383.0s)]
*  I should give a major shout out to you. Remember [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8385.0s)]
*  Gil Castillo? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8387.0s)]
*  He was a good guy. Cesar Gracie Blackbelts. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8389.0s)]
*  A buddy of mine. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8391.0s)]
*  Remember he had that wrestling match? [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8393.0s)]
*  The Jiu Jitsu match with a giant football player? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8395.0s)]
*  From the Buccan leaders. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8397.0s)]
*  I was there for that. I was in the room for that. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8399.0s)]
*  That was wild. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8401.0s)]
*  That might have been exactly this time. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8403.0s)]
*  Matter of fact. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8405.0s)]
*  I think it was that time. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8407.0s)]
*  See if you can find that. He's funny, man. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8409.0s)]
*  He was there for a couple of my fights. He was in my corner [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8411.0s)]
*  for that Lantey fight but he goes, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8413.0s)]
*  what are you doing? And I told him, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8415.0s)]
*  I gotta make 155 and I'm 160. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8417.0s)]
*  He goes, dude, you're there. What are you talking about? [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8419.0s)]
*  He's like, eat. He made me eat. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8421.0s)]
*  I wasn't eating. So he actually, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8423.0s)]
*  I didn't know what the fuck to do. I didn't wrestle. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8425.0s)]
*  I wrestled like a season and then I didn't get along [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8427.0s)]
*  with the coaches. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8429.0s)]

*  but I remember I caught [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8459.0s)]
*  something from that. So I was like home [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8461.0s)]
*  just shivering after that fucking. That's what's crazy. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8463.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of guys who cut weight and get sick. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8465.0s)]
*  They get sick like that night. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8467.0s)]
*  Because your immune system is so crushed. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8469.0s)]
*  I was fucked up. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8471.0s)]
*  You see it a lot. Like a lot of times you see guys are throwing up [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8473.0s)]
*  like in the theater. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8475.0s)]
*  The weird thing is when they black out. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8477.0s)]
*  And you gotta tell them, hey man. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8479.0s)]
*  Not today. That's so scary [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8481.0s)]

*  a way around that? Like how is [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8485.0s)]
*  one doing it? Do you think they're doing it [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8487.0s)]
*  effectively? I think so. I'm not [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8489.0s)]
*  a big weight cutting guy. I am not either. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8491.0s)]
*  I don't really like it. I think you should just fight [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8493.0s)]
*  higher weights. If you [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8495.0s)]
*  struggle to make a weight, you need to go up. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8497.0s)]
*  Don't you think they should have more weight class? [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8499.0s)]
*  And they can have more weight. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8501.0s)]
*  I was a tweener. I was small [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8503.0s)]
*  for 170 kind of. I really was. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8505.0s)]
*  And 155 was [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8507.0s)]
*  a fucking bitch to get to. Especially [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8509.0s)]
*  now when you see guys like Hamsa that make [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8511.0s)]
*  170. Like how the fuck? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8513.0s)]
*  I just had Mike Mulan on my show the other day. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8515.0s)]
*  He's on your field. He's a 6'1". [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8517.0s)]
*  He's huge. I'm like I'm 5'6". [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8519.0s)]
*  These guys at [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8521.0s)]
*  that weight class. At 170 [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8523.0s)]
*  these are 200 pound guys. It's like Kamaru. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8525.0s)]
*  I mean you can't [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8527.0s)]
*  be small for that weight class with a guy like Kamaru. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8529.0s)]
*  But if we had every 10 pounds [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8531.0s)]
*  I think it evens it out better. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8533.0s)]
*  I think 55, 65, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8535.0s)]
*  75, 85, 95, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8537.0s)]
*  205, maybe [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8539.0s)]
*  225, and then heavyweight. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8541.0s)]
*  And I don't think heavyweight should be 265. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8543.0s)]
*  I think that's ridiculous. I think heavyweight [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8545.0s)]
*  should be what the fuck do you weigh? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8547.0s)]
*  318 pounds. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8549.0s)]
*  Who's that giant [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8551.0s)]
*  Russian cat? What was his name? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8553.0s)]
*  Valyuev. Remember that guy? He was a legitimate [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8555.0s)]
*  giant. He was like 7 feet tall. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8557.0s)]
*  I think Holyfield beat him. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8559.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, the boxer! [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8561.0s)]
*  I was like I'm thinking MMA fighter. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8563.0s)]
*  Remember that guy? That guy [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8565.0s)]
*  was a legit giant. He was [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8567.0s)]
*  fucking huge. Picture in the suit on the right. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8569.0s)]
*  Something out of fucking James Bond. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8571.0s)]
*  David Hayle. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8573.0s)]
*  See if you can find [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8575.0s)]
*  did Valyuev fight [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8577.0s)]
*  Evander Holyfield? [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8579.0s)]
*  I don't remember who won that fight. Where is Mr. Bond? [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8583.0s)]
*  David Hayle. Put an eye patch on [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8585.0s)]
*  that motherfucker. He's a villain from the fucking... [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8587.0s)]
*  He was. He should. He missed his calling. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8589.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was a legitimate [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8591.0s)]
*  giant. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8593.0s)]
*  Yeah, Holyfield. Yep, there it is. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8595.0s)]
*  Who won there? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8597.0s)]
*  David was 100 pounds heavier [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8601.0s)]
*  than Holyfield. He weighed 310 pounds. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8603.0s)]
*  And Valyuev won a wildly [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8605.0s)]
*  disputed majority. That's right. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8607.0s)]
*  That's crazy. Most people thought that Evander [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8609.0s)]
*  should have won that fight. Evander was 46. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8611.0s)]
*  The WBA had to investigate [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8613.0s)]
*  the decision. Wow. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8615.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8617.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of dirty shit in boxing. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8619.0s)]
*  Ooh, dirty, dirty, dirty. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8621.0s)]
*  What about when Vitor went [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8623.0s)]
*  versus him and like... [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8625.0s)]
*  I mean, I like Vitor. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8627.0s)]
*  You know? And afterwards [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8629.0s)]
*  he's acting like he beat Holyfield in his [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8631.0s)]
*  previous... He's beating a fucking 60 year old. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8633.0s)]
*  He calmed the fuck down. Who took the fight on short notice. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8635.0s)]
*  But also Holyfield, [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8637.0s)]
*  if he knocked him out, he would be celebrating. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8639.0s)]
*  It's still a fight. If Holyfield [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8641.0s)]
*  knocked out Vitor, he'd be celebrating. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8643.0s)]
*  Yeah, because he's fighting a youngster and he's fucking 60. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8645.0s)]
*  I would be fucking doing cartwheels. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8647.0s)]
*  You're right, but also [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8649.0s)]
*  it is a fight. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8651.0s)]
*  It is a fight, but he's fighting a 60 year old. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8653.0s)]
*  Right, but if Holyfield could have caught him [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8655.0s)]
*  and knocked him out, he would have knocked Vitor out. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8657.0s)]
*  And he would have celebrated. I mean, I know what you're saying. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8659.0s)]
*  No, no, but [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8661.0s)]
*  rightfully so. This would be more like [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8663.0s)]
*  he didn't have his legs, he was just stumbling around. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8665.0s)]
*  It was wild. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8667.0s)]
*  And you know, Vitor's in his 40s and [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8669.0s)]
*  he's got all the Mexican supplements. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8671.0s)]
*  But that's when I knew we were living in a parallel universe. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8673.0s)]
*  It was when Donald Trump [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8675.0s)]
*  was like the commentator for that. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8677.0s)]
*  Yeah, was that, did he really do commentary? [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8679.0s)]
*  I don't know if it was commentary, [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8681.0s)]
*  but he was somewhere in on a broadcasting [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8683.0s)]
*  of Vitor Belfort [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8685.0s)]
*  Evander Holyfield boxing match. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8687.0s)]
*  Vitor, look good back on the sausage, baby. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8689.0s)]
*  Yeah, he got that fucking [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8691.0s)]
*  I don't think you saw that. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8693.0s)]
*  It was an amazing fight. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8695.0s)]
*  They fought as I would. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8697.0s)]
*  I'd be pissed too if I was [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8699.0s)]
*  Michael Bisping. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8701.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8703.0s)]
*  Was that the noise? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8705.0s)]
*  I'd be pretty fucking bitter too. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8707.0s)]
*  TRT Belfort [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8709.0s)]
*  was a fucking thing to behold. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8711.0s)]
*  He was a thing to behold, man. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8713.0s)]
*  Luke Rockhold said [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8715.0s)]
*  when he saw him when they were at the weigh-in [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8717.0s)]
*  he was like, what the fuck is this guy on? [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8719.0s)]
*  Woo! [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8723.0s)]
*  Because he had all the age [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8725.0s)]
*  and wisdom and experience [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8727.0s)]
*  but then he had a body that moved like [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8729.0s)]
*  a super athlete. It was crazy. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8731.0s)]
*  Remember with Rockhold, he's throwing [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8733.0s)]
*  wheel kicks and shit? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8735.0s)]
*  The difference between USADA and no USADA. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8737.0s)]
*  That is a crazy difference. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8739.0s)]
*  Good overroom. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8743.0s)]
*  The worst was when he fought Weidman. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8745.0s)]
*  Because when he fought Weidman he was right off of it. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8747.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8749.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8751.0s)]
*  So obvious. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8753.0s)]
*  I've found that. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8755.0s)]
*  Yeah, overream's lost. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8757.0s)]
*  Overream's doing triathlons. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8759.0s)]
*  What am I looking at here? [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8761.0s)]
*  Look at his face! [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8763.0s)]
*  Maybe he's going down to 205. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8765.0s)]
*  What did I ask you to find? [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8767.0s)]
*  No. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8775.0s)]
*  Shit. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8777.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8779.0s)]
*  Damn, overream's face? [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8781.0s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8783.0s)]
*  Vitor versus Chris Weidman. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8785.0s)]
*  Find that. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8787.0s)]
*  Also, it's not fair [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8789.0s)]
*  to make him do that. Hey, you want to fight for a title? [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8791.0s)]
*  Go to cold turkey off TRT. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8793.0s)]
*  Your body's been living off of it for years. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8795.0s)]
*  And now your body's not producing [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8797.0s)]
*  testosterone correctly anymore. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8799.0s)]
*  And then fight the world champion Chris Weidman [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8801.0s)]
*  who's natural and a fucking monster. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8803.0s)]
*  Like he just looked way different. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8807.0s)]
*  Like physically. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8809.0s)]
*  Look at him. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8811.0s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy, the difference. [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8813.0s)]
*  It was not fair for Vitor. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8815.0s)]
*  I mean, I know he probably took it because he wanted to fight for the title. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8817.0s)]
*  But there's no way [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8819.0s)]
*  your body is working at an optimum state [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8821.0s)]
*  after all those years of being on that. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8823.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8825.0s)]
*  He's not making any friends with that haircut either. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8827.0s)]
*  Well, he used to love that haircut. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8829.0s)]
*  That was his go to war haircut. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8831.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8833.0s)]
*  Didn't he have that haircut when he fought Bisping? [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8835.0s)]
*  Close to it? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8837.0s)]
*  He's been fucking doing figs. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8839.0s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8845.0s)]
*  Wild scrambles. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8847.0s)]
*  It still was a good fight. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8849.0s)]
*  Until Weidman got him down. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8851.0s)]
*  Look, Vitor's a talented guy. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8853.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8855.0s)]
*  He's going for broke against Weidman [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8857.0s)]
*  which is very dangerous. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8859.0s)]
*  Because if you gas out, this motherfucker never does. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8861.0s)]
*  And then Chris got him down. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8865.0s)]
*  He gets mounted. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8867.0s)]
*  Vitor clearly fatigued. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8869.0s)]
*  He ran out of gas in that fight. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8871.0s)]
*  And that's just... [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8873.0s)]
*  If your body's not making testosterone, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8875.0s)]
*  there's no way you can sustain [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8877.0s)]
*  the way he did at his prime. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8879.0s)]
*  But that's the way you take that fight anyway. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8881.0s)]
*  If you know you're taking on short notice, [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8883.0s)]
*  you just go for broke. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8885.0s)]
*  And then when you gas out, you just quit. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8887.0s)]
*  I guess. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8889.0s)]
*  But he didn't just gas out. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8891.0s)]
*  He got the fuck beat out of him. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8893.0s)]
*  And I would just quit. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8895.0s)]
*  When you had TRT Vitor, then what do we call Vitor [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8897.0s)]
*  when he came on the scene and he was like 225 jacked? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8899.0s)]
*  Oh, that was everything. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8901.0s)]
*  Well, the first fight he was like 200. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8903.0s)]
*  Like when he fought a tank. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8905.0s)]
*  What about when he beat Vanderlei? [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8907.0s)]
*  How crazy was that? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8909.0s)]
*  What was crazy was when he got up to fight Randy Couture. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8911.0s)]
*  So the Randy Couture fight was like 240. [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8913.0s)]
*  He was giant. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8915.0s)]
*  His traps started at the top of his head. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8917.0s)]
*  He just went straight down. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8919.0s)]
*  But he gassed out in that fight. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8921.0s)]
*  He was fucking in his prime back then. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8923.0s)]
*  And Randy was so solid. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8925.0s)]
*  See if you can find what Vitor looked like. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8927.0s)]
*  He was super jacked. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8929.0s)]
*  He looked like a lion. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8931.0s)]
*  I think they'd make it another Expendables movie. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8933.0s)]
*  Is that right? [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8935.0s)]
*  I swear to God. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8937.0s)]
*  Why not? [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8939.0s)]
*  They have like 85 Fast and the Furious. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8941.0s)]
*  I think Dolph Lundgren's in it too. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8943.0s)]
*  Is that the Randy Couture fight? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8945.0s)]
*  See if you can find... [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8947.0s)]
*  Is that the fight? [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8949.0s)]
*  Is that the fight? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8951.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8953.0s)]
*  That was the second time they fought. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8955.0s)]
*  That was at 205. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8957.0s)]
*  In that fight, he actually cut Randy. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8959.0s)]
*  He cut his eyelid straight open. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8961.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I remember. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8963.0s)]
*  It was like in the first 10 seconds. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8965.0s)]
*  That's how Vitor won the title. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8967.0s)]
*  And then Randy came back and beat him. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8969.0s)]
*  So that's the second fight. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8971.0s)]
*  It was back when they were wearing shoes. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8973.0s)]
*  That's it. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8975.0s)]
*  Up in the upper right hand corner of the small photos. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8977.0s)]
*  So that's the first time they fought. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8979.0s)]
*  Because Randy was wearing shoes. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8981.0s)]
*  He was wearing shoes? [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8983.0s)]
*  That's Vitor 3. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8985.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's definitely not. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8987.0s)]
*  That's definitely the first fight. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8989.0s)]
*  100% because that's him wearing shoes. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8991.0s)]
*  He was fucking jacked. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8993.0s)]
*  I remember that. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8995.0s)]
*  He was hanging out with his dude that was like his weightlifting coach. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8997.0s)]
*  That bodybuilder dude? [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=8999.0s)]
*  We used to call that dude garden hoses. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9001.0s)]
*  He had some cable veins down his arms. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9003.0s)]
*  It was crazy. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9005.0s)]
*  The guy he was hanging with, I don't think he was a Brazilian guy. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9007.0s)]
*  He was an American guy. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9009.0s)]
*  I think he wind up dying of a heart attack. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9011.0s)]
*  That guy was American? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9013.0s)]
*  The guy was purple? [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9015.0s)]
*  He was purple. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9017.0s)]
*  It was like this. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9019.0s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9021.0s)]
*  He was so big. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9023.0s)]
*  It was preposterous. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9025.0s)]
*  And you're like, that's Vitor's weightlifting coach? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9027.0s)]
*  Well he definitely has a connection. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9029.0s)]
*  When he beat Vanderlei Silva. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9031.0s)]
*  No, no. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9033.0s)]
*  That's Anderson's guy. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9035.0s)]
*  Click on that guy though. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9037.0s)]
*  When Anderson got popped, that was his guy. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9039.0s)]
*  And I think homeboy was like 60 in this picture. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9041.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9043.0s)]
*  I see him around all the time. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9045.0s)]
*  That guy swole. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9047.0s)]
*  That was when Anderson got popped. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9049.0s)]
*  Vitor's guy, I don't think there's photos of him. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9051.0s)]
*  We're talking about the 90s. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9053.0s)]
*  It was like 97, 98. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9055.0s)]
*  I remember that guy. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9057.0s)]
*  Purple. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9059.0s)]
*  I don't think he lived very long. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9061.0s)]
*  I think he was like riding the lightning. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9063.0s)]
*  He doesn't get no blood work done. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9067.0s)]
*  No. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9069.0s)]
*  He was stuffing that bag. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9071.0s)]
*  I didn't know what blood work was back then. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9073.0s)]
*  I mean a few guys probably did. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9075.0s)]
*  It's a crazy thing when you think about the early days of the UFC. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9077.0s)]
*  Because you were talking about pre-USADA and post-USADA. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9079.0s)]
*  You guys fought clean. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9081.0s)]
*  But what percentage didn't? [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9083.0s)]
*  Oh, who knows? [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9085.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, man. I wonder how many guys I fought that were fucking pissing dirty. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9087.0s)]
*  Probably almost everybody. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9089.0s)]
*  It was kind of an attempt. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9091.0s)]
*  That's the dude. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9093.0s)]
*  How'd you find that, Jamie? [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9095.0s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9097.0s)]
*  Jamie's the best. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9099.0s)]
*  Look at his fucking veins, man. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9101.0s)]
*  Those veins are crazy. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9103.0s)]
*  How did he die? [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9105.0s)]
*  He was a strong man. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9107.0s)]
*  That guy had the most crazy veins. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9109.0s)]
*  How did he die? [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9111.0s)]
*  Did it say? [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9113.0s)]
*  That was the dude who was training Vitor. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9115.0s)]
*  He was always with him. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9117.0s)]
*  But they had a different idea of strength training back then. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9119.0s)]
*  He was only 36 when he died. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9121.0s)]
*  He was only 36 when he died. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9123.0s)]
*  Jesus, heart attack. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9125.0s)]
*  I wonder where that came from. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9127.0s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9129.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9131.0s)]
*  I never even did heavy weights at all when I was fighting. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9133.0s)]
*  Longo would just put me through the calisthenics and plyometrics and all that kind of stuff. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9135.0s)]
*  I would get too tight. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9137.0s)]
*  Functional training is the way to go for it. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9139.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm not saying that you're not going to get too tight. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9141.0s)]
*  I'm just saying that you're going to get too tight. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9143.0s)]
*  Yeah, functional training is the way to go for it. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9145.0s)]
*  Did you do kettlebells or anything with weights? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9147.0s)]
*  Lighter weights? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9149.0s)]
*  Towards the end we started messing with some kettlebell stuff. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9151.0s)]
*  But not too much. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9153.0s)]
*  Plyometrics? [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9155.0s)]
*  Plyometrics a lot. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9157.0s)]
*  I still do stuff like that now. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9159.0s)]
*  There's times where if I work out now, [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9161.0s)]
*  something to keep me in shape. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9163.0s)]
*  After Jiu Jitsu, [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9165.0s)]
*  I'll do me and my buddy. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9167.0s)]
*  I did this right before I got on the plane. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9169.0s)]
*  I'll do 20 pushups. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9171.0s)]
*  I put my fist under him. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9173.0s)]
*  He has to touch the fist. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9175.0s)]
*  So you're not cheating. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9177.0s)]
*  He does 20, 15, 15, 10, 10, 5, 5. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9179.0s)]
*  And then back up. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9181.0s)]
*  5, 5, 10, 10. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9183.0s)]
*  It ends up being 100 pushups. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9185.0s)]
*  So instead of doing 100 pushups straight, [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9187.0s)]
*  that can be annoying and fucking whatever. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9189.0s)]
*  This way, but when you're coming back up to the last 20, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9191.0s)]
*  it's annoying. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9193.0s)]
*  It's enough to make you say fuck you. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9195.0s)]
*  And then if I'm doing it by myself, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9197.0s)]
*  I'll do 20 turnovers, [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9199.0s)]
*  20 squats, 20 sit-ups. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9201.0s)]
*  I do it that way. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9203.0s)]
*  And again, this is not the whole workout, [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9205.0s)]
*  but this is what I do after my Jiu Jitsu training. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9207.0s)]
*  So it's how many pushups I get a week in. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9209.0s)]
*  That's how I warm up from the cold plunge. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9211.0s)]
*  I do 100 bodyweight squats and 100 pushups. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9213.0s)]
*  That's my warm up. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9215.0s)]
*  I do sets of 5. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9217.0s)]
*  So I get out of the cold. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9219.0s)]
*  I start with the cold. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9221.0s)]
*  There was some study done, I think it was a Japanese study, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9223.0s)]
*  about elevating your testosterone [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9225.0s)]
*  and also increasing your ability to do work. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9227.0s)]
*  Because your body is like, you kill all the inflammation [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9229.0s)]
*  very quickly in the beginning, [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9231.0s)]
*  and then you warm your body up. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9233.0s)]
*  So some guys like to do it on the, [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9235.0s)]
*  they like to get on the echo bike. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9237.0s)]
*  But I find like bodyweight squats and pushups, [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9239.0s)]
*  it's like I have to do them anyway. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9241.0s)]
*  I do 100 every day anyway, so that's a good way to warm up. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9243.0s)]
*  So by the time I do 5 sets of 20, [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9245.0s)]
*  everything's warmed up, and then I can do other shit. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9247.0s)]
*  See, the cold plunge, [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9249.0s)]
*  I could, my ears suck, man. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9251.0s)]
*  If I go under the water at all... [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9253.0s)]
*  You don't have to go under the water. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9255.0s)]
*  I dunk my head sometimes. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9257.0s)]
*  Now how long did it take you before you were able to do that? [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9259.0s)]
*  Because I just, I can't do it. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9261.0s)]
*  The first one is a video of me, I bitched out in like a minute and 20 seconds. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9263.0s)]
*  I couldn't do it. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9265.0s)]
*  I mean I couldn't do 20 seconds. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9267.0s)]
*  It was so cold, but then I realized [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9269.0s)]
*  I'm just freaking out, and just relax. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9271.0s)]
*  And do breathing exercise. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9273.0s)]
*  So the next time I did it, I did like 4 and a half, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9275.0s)]
*  and then I wanted to see how long I could do it, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9277.0s)]
*  and the next time I did it, I did 20 minutes. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9279.0s)]
*  And don't do that, don't do that. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9281.0s)]
*  20 minutes is too much. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9283.0s)]
*  I was in the sun, I slept up for a few days. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9285.0s)]
*  That wasn't so good for you. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9287.0s)]
*  I was dry, it was in 90 degree weather, [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9289.0s)]
*  I drove from my house to here, [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9291.0s)]
*  with the windows rolled up, [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9293.0s)]
*  no AC on, and I was freezing. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9295.0s)]
*  So I'm in a hot box. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9297.0s)]
*  I mean, I put the seat heater on in my truck. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9299.0s)]
*  I was freezing. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9301.0s)]
*  And it was 90 degrees outside, [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9303.0s)]
*  and the windows were rolled up, [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9305.0s)]
*  and I had no AC on. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9307.0s)]
*  That's how cold I was. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9309.0s)]
*  What were you thinking, maybe just the longer the better? [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9311.0s)]
*  I went to 5 minutes, and I said, let's see if I can go to 10. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9313.0s)]
*  Then I went to 10 minutes, [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9315.0s)]
*  and I said, I think I can make 15. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9317.0s)]
*  Then I got to 15, I'm like, 20 is only 5 minutes away. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9319.0s)]
*  Next thing I know, I got to 20. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9321.0s)]
*  And when I got out, and I did the whole thing on Instagram [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9323.0s)]
*  so I could film it, so I wanted to make sure [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9325.0s)]
*  that I was really doing it. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9327.0s)]
*  But when I got out, I was like, that was not a good idea. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9329.0s)]
*  I do not recommend that. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9331.0s)]
*  It's like hypothermia, it's like 15 minutes or something like that. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9333.0s)]
*  And it's 34 degrees. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9335.0s)]
*  But I'm doing these breathing exercises while I'm doing it. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9337.0s)]
*  And that keeps your core heated up [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9339.0s)]
*  at least a little bit. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9341.0s)]
*  You know how they always say that, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9343.0s)]
*  they always contradict themselves, [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9345.0s)]
*  one second this thing is good for you, the next second it's bad for you. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9347.0s)]
*  What if you're really killing yourself right now? [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9349.0s)]
*  What if they find out that this ice thing [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9351.0s)]
*  killed off the fucking caveman? [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9353.0s)]
*  It's like, I mean, I don't know. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9355.0s)]
*  20 minutes is definitely not good for you, [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9357.0s)]
*  and it probably harms you. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9359.0s)]
*  But doing it 3 minutes at a time, [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9361.0s)]
*  it ramps up your dopamine by 200%, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9363.0s)]
*  it lasts for hours, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9365.0s)]
*  it reduces inflammation. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9367.0s)]
*  I mean, I just get excited. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9369.0s)]
*  When I get out of there, I just feel great. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9371.0s)]
*  And I'll do like, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9373.0s)]
*  I'll warm up out in the sun, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9375.0s)]
*  so I freeze, I get out, I towel myself off, [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9377.0s)]
*  and then I'll do all my warm up shit out in the sun. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9379.0s)]
*  I'll do my push ups and my body weight squats out in the sun. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9381.0s)]
*  Get the sunlight, feel good, [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9385.0s)]
*  you know, get a little bit of a sweat going [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9387.0s)]
*  by the end of 100, [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9389.0s)]
*  and then I start working out. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9391.0s)]
*  You don't got that shit in New York though, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9393.0s)]
*  you fucking jump out, it's still fucking cold. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9395.0s)]
*  Try it in the summer, try it now. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9397.0s)]
*  But it's not for everybody, [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9399.0s)]
*  but for me, it feels good. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9401.0s)]
*  I like it. It's a good way to get it going. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9403.0s)]
*  It feels fucking good, man. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9405.0s)]
*  Is it indoors or outdoors? [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9407.0s)]
*  Outdoors, yeah. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9409.0s)]
*  And I got a barrel sauna right next to it, [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9411.0s)]
*  so I'll hop in there, motherfucker, [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9413.0s)]
*  after my workouts. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9415.0s)]
*  Let me ask you, man, because I love, [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9417.0s)]
*  I start my day with a nice steam, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9419.0s)]
*  I love the steam shower. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9421.0s)]
*  But why is it not as good as the sauna? [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9423.0s)]
*  So the thing is, it's all about heat shock proteins. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9425.0s)]
*  It's all about your body responding [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9427.0s)]
*  to the fact that it's dying. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9429.0s)]
*  You're in an extreme situation [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9431.0s)]
*  where your body's like, holy fuck. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9433.0s)]
*  So your body starts producing all these cytokines, [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9435.0s)]
*  all these anti-inflammatory heat shock proteins. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9437.0s)]
*  And the study that did that [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9439.0s)]
*  out of Finland, they did a study [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9441.0s)]
*  where they studied people over 20 years. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9443.0s)]
*  How many people were in that study? [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9445.0s)]
*  Find out how many people were in that Finland study. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9447.0s)]
*  So after 20 years, they found out the people [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9449.0s)]
*  that did it four times per week, [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9451.0s)]
*  had a 40% decrease of all-cause mortality. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9453.0s)]
*  Everything. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9455.0s)]
*  40% decrease in heart attacks, stroke, cancer, everything. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9457.0s)]
*  And this was, they think, [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9459.0s)]
*  directly connected to these heat shock proteins [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9461.0s)]
*  and the use of the sauna on a regular basis. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9463.0s)]
*  Four times a week, 20 minutes at a time. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9465.0s)]
*  So 2,300 middle-aged men [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9467.0s)]
*  for an average of 20 years. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9469.0s)]
*  They categorized the men into three groups [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9471.0s)]
*  according to how often they used the sauna each week. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9473.0s)]
*  The men spent an average of 14 minutes per visit [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9475.0s)]
*  baking in 175 degrees heat. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9477.0s)]
*  Fairly high temperature, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9479.0s)]
*  175 degrees Fahrenheit. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9481.0s)]
*  Over the course of the study, [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9483.0s)]
*  49% of the men who went to the sauna once a week died, [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9485.0s)]
*  compared to 38% of the ones [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9487.0s)]
*  who went two to three times a week, [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9489.0s)]
*  and just 31% [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9491.0s)]
*  of those who went four to seven times a week. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9493.0s)]
*  Frequent visits to a sauna [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9495.0s)]
*  were associated with lower death rates [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9497.0s)]
*  from cardiovascular disease and stroke. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9499.0s)]
*  And the results don't surprise [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9501.0s)]
*  Dr. Thomas H. Lee, [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9503.0s)]
*  cardiologist at Harvard-affiliated [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9505.0s)]
*  Brigham and Women's Hospital [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9507.0s)]
*  and editor of the Harvard Heart Letter. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9509.0s)]
*  The cardiovascular effects of sauna have been [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9511.0s)]
*  well documented in the past. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9513.0s)]
*  It lowers blood pressure, and there is [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9515.0s)]
*  every reason to believe that its effects are [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9517.0s)]
*  good for blood vessels. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9519.0s)]
*  So it's good for a lot of different shit. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9521.0s)]
*  And it also, [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9523.0s)]
*  you just feel better. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9525.0s)]
*  You feel better when you get out. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9527.0s)]
*  I feel like that with my steam. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9529.0s)]
*  He said the results aren't [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9531.0s)]
*  applicable to steam baths and hot tubs. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9533.0s)]
*  Finish sauna is a wood-lined room [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9535.0s)]
*  and is specifically heated to a stove topped with stones. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9537.0s)]
*  Air inside the sauna is very hot and dry. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9539.0s)]
*  All the sauna bathers periodically [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9541.0s)]
*  add water to the stones to produce [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9543.0s)]
*  a vapor known as loyally? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9545.0s)]
*  How about just steam, you fucking weirdos? [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9547.0s)]
*  That's just a word that we know. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9549.0s)]
*  They produce something called loyally. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9551.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean steam? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9553.0s)]
*  But they throw like eucalyptus oil [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9555.0s)]
*  in there and shit and throw it on the rocks. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9557.0s)]
*  But the key is like [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9559.0s)]
*  you do it, it increases your cardio. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9561.0s)]
*  Like Dan Gable talked about how he [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9563.0s)]
*  figured it out from wrestlers, like the Eastern European guys [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9565.0s)]
*  were using it. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9567.0s)]
*  And they realized it was an integral part of their training [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9569.0s)]
*  to do sauna afterwards. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9571.0s)]
*  What it's also is like static cardio. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9573.0s)]
*  So if I do a hard workout, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9575.0s)]
*  like say if I do like rounds in the back, [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9577.0s)]
*  I'll go straight into the sauna. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9579.0s)]
*  My heart is already 120-something [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9581.0s)]
*  beats per second after I get the gloves off. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9583.0s)]
*  And I sit in there and it just [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9585.0s)]
*  is 185 degrees. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9587.0s)]
*  And your heart rate gets back to 147. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9589.0s)]
*  And just stays there when you're just sitting there. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9591.0s)]
*  You're sitting there suffering. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9593.0s)]
*  So you do that for 20 minutes. It's like 20 minutes of cardio. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9595.0s)]
*  But also all the heat shock benefits. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9597.0s)]
*  And when you come out of there, [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9599.0s)]
*  you feel fucking great. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9601.0s)]
*  You just feel ooh. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9603.0s)]
*  So wait a minute, so in the morning you should do the cold stuff [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9605.0s)]
*  and then like in the afternoon do the sauna. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9607.0s)]
*  The way I do it, it depends on how much time I have. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9609.0s)]
*  I like to do the sauna before I go to bed. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9611.0s)]
*  That's my favorite way because it makes me sleep good. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9613.0s)]
*  But I also like to do it at the end of a hard workout. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9615.0s)]
*  So I'll do the cold to start my workout. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9617.0s)]
*  That's the first thing I do. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9619.0s)]
*  And then I have to heat my body back up until I can really work out. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9621.0s)]
*  Then I work out. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9623.0s)]
*  And then when I'm done working out, [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9625.0s)]
*  then when I'm all sweaty, then I hop in the sauna. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9627.0s)]
*  I mean it makes sense. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9629.0s)]
*  Because if you do the cold after, it kind of defeats the purpose of the workout. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9631.0s)]
*  Yes, definitely for hypertrophy. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9633.0s)]
*  But for people who do cardio, especially if you're doing hard jiu jitsu, [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9635.0s)]
*  maybe a good move to do it afterwards, you could train more. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9637.0s)]
*  I know a lot of guys do that with cryo. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9639.0s)]
*  They like to do cryo. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9641.0s)]
*  Like Eddie Bravo said, when he had a hard workout, [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9643.0s)]
*  he would do it with a lot of people. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9645.0s)]
*  And he would do it with a lot of people. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9647.0s)]
*  So he would do it with a lot of people. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9649.0s)]
*  Eddie Bravo said, when he had that rematch with Hoyler Gracie, [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9651.0s)]
*  he said, there's no way I would have been able to train like that without cryo. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9653.0s)]
*  Because he was just doing cryo sessions after every workout. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9655.0s)]
*  That's where you wear the mittens? [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9657.0s)]
*  Yeah, you freeze your dick off like 250 degrees below zero for three minutes. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9659.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not built for that either. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9661.0s)]
*  I just want to do steroids. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9663.0s)]
*  That's all I want to do. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9665.0s)]
*  If I just get some steroids, I'm good to go. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9667.0s)]
*  You're not on TOT? [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9669.0s)]
*  No. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9671.0s)]
*  I need to. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9673.0s)]
*  I don't know. I just don't feel like paying for it. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9675.0s)]
*  Get your health, though. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9677.0s)]
*  It's money well spent. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9679.0s)]
*  Eventually I will. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9681.0s)]
*  When you guys are here, I've got to get you to Ways to Well. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9683.0s)]
*  Get you into Ways to Well. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9685.0s)]
*  They'll do an extensive blood panel on you [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9687.0s)]
*  and find out what your nutrient levels are. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9689.0s)]
*  They're very comprehensive. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9691.0s)]
*  That's why I wanted to know if you've got real good blood work done. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9693.0s)]
*  They'll give you a booklet. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9695.0s)]
*  They'll do an analysis of your blood work [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9697.0s)]
*  and all the different things they test for. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9699.0s)]
*  They test for a lot of shit. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9701.0s)]
*  They can pull out a lot of blood. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9703.0s)]
*  I've got a buddy at home. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9705.0s)]
*  It's the same type of spot. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9707.0s)]
*  They're actually meeting with your buddy. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9709.0s)]
*  That's the guy I texted you about. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9711.0s)]
*  They do a very similar thing. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9713.0s)]
*  Definitely you should do it. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9715.0s)]
*  It's good to know. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9717.0s)]
*  It's good to know what's going on. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9719.0s)]
*  I was low in DHEA. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9721.0s)]
*  I didn't realize how dehydrated I got from the sauna. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9723.0s)]
*  One time I went straight there [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9727.0s)]
*  to get my blood drawn after the sauna. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9729.0s)]
*  They're like, bro, you're fucking dehydrated. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9731.0s)]
*  You probably drink a lot of water. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9733.0s)]
*  I drink a shitload of water. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9735.0s)]
*  After that, I doubled and tripled up to the point [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9737.0s)]
*  where it was a problem during podcasts. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9739.0s)]
*  I'd have to piss so often. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9741.0s)]
*  I'd have to run up. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9743.0s)]
*  I'll lend you a piss jug. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9745.0s)]
*  I think I got one lying around in the house. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9747.0s)]
*  You should sell that on eBay. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9749.0s)]
*  It's probably worth money. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9751.0s)]
*  It was like one of them arrowhead jugs. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9753.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9755.0s)]
*  You know what's funny? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9757.0s)]
*  I had a habit of doing that forever. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9759.0s)]
*  I kept doing it when I was married. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9761.0s)]
*  I'd turn over. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9763.0s)]
*  So finally, my wife's like, look. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9765.0s)]
*  You can't have a bucket of piss next to the bed. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9769.0s)]
*  My wife, after a little bit, she goes, [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9772.0s)]
*  look, this is disgusting. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9774.0s)]
*  My mother-in-law was over cleaning with my wife. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9776.0s)]
*  She's like, I got to... [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9780.0s)]
*  That's not Snapple! Put that down! [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9782.0s)]
*  My mother-in-law had my Snapple bottle full of piss. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9785.0s)]
*  Oh, no! [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9789.0s)]
*  My wife got me civilized. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9791.0s)]
*  I'm not an animal. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9793.0s)]
*  I told you she's been good for you. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9795.0s)]
*  My wife, like Ray Longo said, [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9797.0s)]
*  she raised my stock. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9799.0s)]
*  I'm not an animal anymore. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9801.0s)]
*  You need a woman like that, right? [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9803.0s)]
*  For a guy like you? [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9805.0s)]
*  The right girl will bring you up. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9807.0s)]
*  The wrong one will ruin you. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9809.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9811.0s)]
*  I guess women will say that about men, too. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9813.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9815.0s)]
*  The right one is not the right one for everybody. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9817.0s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9819.0s)]
*  You got to find that chemistry. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9821.0s)]
*  You got to find yours. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9823.0s)]
*  And don't settle. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9825.0s)]
*  Don't you fucking settle. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9827.0s)]
*  Keep moving. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9829.0s)]
*  Throw that phone in the lake and keep moving. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9831.0s)]
*  You got to know when to abandon ship. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9833.0s)]
*  Abandon ship and light the boats on fire. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9835.0s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9837.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9839.0s)]
*  No, 100%, man. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9841.0s)]
*  I dodged some bullets, too. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9843.0s)]
*  You think about some paths you could have went down. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9845.0s)]
*  Fuck, man. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9847.0s)]
*  All sorts of ways in life. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9849.0s)]
*  That could have been the mother of my kids, holy fuck. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9851.0s)]
*  Also, other things. Just think about fights. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9853.0s)]
*  Just think about street fights you got in when you were a kid. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9855.0s)]
*  How many people do you know that got in street fights [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9857.0s)]
*  where somebody could have died and then all of a sudden you're in jail? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9859.0s)]
*  Yeah, no shit. Doing dumb shit. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9861.0s)]
*  You remember Kevin James? [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9863.0s)]
*  Kevin James worked as a bouncer with this guy in Long Island. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9865.0s)]
*  And this guy knocked some guy out. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9867.0s)]
*  The guy fell just like fucking Steve-O. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9869.0s)]
*  Hit his head, dead. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9871.0s)]
*  And then he goes to jail. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9873.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9875.0s)]
*  Happens all the time. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9877.0s)]
*  See, Matt, that's why I be keeping you out of trouble. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9879.0s)]
*  Every time we go out, Matt, I almost get in trouble. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9881.0s)]
*  I don't look for trouble, obviously. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9883.0s)]
*  Well, if they see your nails, they're like, there's no nails. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9885.0s)]
*  You gotta fuck off with that. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9887.0s)]
*  Why are you making it like I'm a fucking... [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9889.0s)]
*  This is what everybody's going to take out of this. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9891.0s)]
*  They're like, hey, fuck face, look at your nails. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9893.0s)]
*  They're all long, though. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9895.0s)]
*  I noticed it this morning. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9897.0s)]
*  I love that you're still rolling, though. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9899.0s)]
*  Even with your knee replacement. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9901.0s)]
*  Oh, the knee feels good. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9903.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9905.0s)]
*  Because I was worried. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9907.0s)]
*  When you hear about people getting knee replacements, [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9909.0s)]
*  I don't really hear too much about Jiu Jitsu guys doing that. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9911.0s)]
*  I was concerned, man. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9913.0s)]
*  The last... [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9915.0s)]
*  Me and you did the episode [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9917.0s)]
*  when you had to catch the ball and I was sitting out. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9919.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, in Denver. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9921.0s)]
*  We were looking for a fight. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9923.0s)]
*  In that episode, I don't like... [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9925.0s)]
*  The reason why I put off the knee so long, [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9927.0s)]
*  I had my knee surgery. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9929.0s)]
*  Is this the same knee that you had injured [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9931.0s)]
*  when you said you tore your meniscus before the caro fight? [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9933.0s)]
*  My meniscus? [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9935.0s)]
*  No, I think it's the other knee. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9937.0s)]
*  Believe it or not. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9939.0s)]
*  I was supposed to get both my knees done. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9941.0s)]
*  But I'm not getting the other one done right away [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9943.0s)]
*  because I have fucking... [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9945.0s)]
*  I can walk. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9947.0s)]
*  It passed the test of... [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9949.0s)]
*  For years, when I'd go to the Disney and Universal, [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9951.0s)]
*  I'd have to get a motorized cart. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9953.0s)]
*  I made it fun. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9955.0s)]
*  I'd walk some edibles and whee, I'm mipping around the butt. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9957.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9959.0s)]
*  The point was, it was... [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9961.0s)]
*  I had to make the best of it. Whee! [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9963.0s)]
*  I couldn't walk. I couldn't walk through the park. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9965.0s)]
*  So the last time we went with my family, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9967.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, this is... [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9969.0s)]
*  I know it sounds simple, but I'm like, [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9971.0s)]
*  oh, this is fucking great. I'm walking with my kids. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9973.0s)]
*  I got a drumstick now. Now I don't feel like a fatty [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9975.0s)]
*  with a big drumstick. Now I'm walking around with it. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9977.0s)]
*  No pain. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9979.0s)]
*  I could walk with my knee. No pain at all. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9981.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9983.0s)]
*  Does it feel like you, or does it feel like [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9985.0s)]
*  something moving with you? [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9987.0s)]
*  Dude, it feels... [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9989.0s)]
*  It feels fine. I mean... [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9991.0s)]
*  I feel, because it's titanium, if someone went to kick me, [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9993.0s)]
*  I could use that to fucking block it. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9995.0s)]
*  He told me that yesterday. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9997.0s)]
*  I could usually... I even asked him, I go... [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=9999.0s)]
*  I go, let's say if someone went to kick me, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10001.0s)]
*  I ask the doctor, I go, would it get on... [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10003.0s)]
*  Would it be able to get kicked out? [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10005.0s)]
*  They go, no, that shit's cemented in there. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10007.0s)]
*  That's not gonna fucking happen. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10009.0s)]
*  And they told you no [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10011.0s)]
*  are there any restrictions on any movements or anything? [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10013.0s)]
*  Well, before I went in, he said that [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10015.0s)]
*  it's like an 80% chance that you'll be able to do [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10017.0s)]
*  everything you want to do. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10019.0s)]
*  I guess they don't want to maybe get your hopes up too high. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10021.0s)]
*  Right, and you're different than most people. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10023.0s)]
*  And most people that get knee replacements are not elite athletes. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10025.0s)]
*  But you know what the problem is? [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10027.0s)]
*  I think they told me that [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10029.0s)]
*  most people when they go into... [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10031.0s)]
*  Dr. Amato, he's a Jiu Jitsu guy, [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10033.0s)]
*  he was my PT guy. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10035.0s)]
*  I'd like to give him a shout out, because he got me back. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10037.0s)]
*  And I felt good, comfortable with him, [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10039.0s)]
*  reassuring me, being a purple belt in Jiu Jitsu, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10041.0s)]
*  he knew what I had to do. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10043.0s)]
*  He goes, you'll be able to do everything. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10045.0s)]
*  Fucking everything. And he's right. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10047.0s)]
*  I'm able to do everything. He goes, Matt, the problem is [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10049.0s)]
*  when they do these, like, whatever, [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10051.0s)]
*  you ask people about, are they able to move their knee [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10053.0s)]
*  the way they were before, a lot of times when they [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10055.0s)]
*  go into the surgery, they can't bend that shit. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10057.0s)]
*  So I was already flexible. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10059.0s)]
*  So I kept everything. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10061.0s)]
*  So that's good. Like I could touch my knee, [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10063.0s)]
*  my foot close to my butt. [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10065.0s)]
*  Can you do triangles with it? Yeah, fuck yeah. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10067.0s)]
*  I can do triangles with it. Yeah, I can do triangles. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10069.0s)]
*  And they told you, like, essentially [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10071.0s)]
*  it's permanent? Like, is it [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10073.0s)]
*  for the rest of your life? Like, how long does it last? [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10075.0s)]
*  I think the [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10077.0s)]
*  thing was, the shelf life was, what was it, [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10079.0s)]
*  about 30 years? Something like that? 20 to 30 [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10081.0s)]
*  or something like that? And then what happens? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10083.0s)]
*  I think we've got to get a new one by then. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10085.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know, I didn't really ask [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10087.0s)]
*  about that. But what happened [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10089.0s)]
*  was, like, with my other [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10091.0s)]
*  like, you could see [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10093.0s)]
*  behind this, I was getting big. Oh, by the way, [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10095.0s)]
*  my socks, it's my family. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10097.0s)]
*  I love you, daddy. [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10099.0s)]
*  But I'm sorry. [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10101.0s)]
*  What I was getting was, [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10103.0s)]
*  that's called a Baker's cyst. [[02:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10105.0s)]
*  This is my knee that I didn't get done yet. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10107.0s)]
*  Holy shit, that's huge. So what happened is, when you have [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10109.0s)]
*  bone on bone, [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10111.0s)]
*  it gets like inflammation [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10113.0s)]
*  and fluid and it ends up going to the [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10115.0s)]
*  back of the knee. See this thing? [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10117.0s)]
*  That thing's all fluid. I have to [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10119.0s)]
*  get that drain, that bitch. And [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10121.0s)]
*  How often do you get it drained? [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10123.0s)]
*  They don't want you to do it too often [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10125.0s)]
*  because they put in a [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10127.0s)]
*  like, what is it, cortisone? [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10129.0s)]
*  And they say that'll [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10131.0s)]
*  fuck up the knee, but I have to get a new knee anyway. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10133.0s)]
*  So I don't give a fuck. So I [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10135.0s)]
*  shoot it up. But [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10137.0s)]
*  you know, but what happens is, [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10139.0s)]
*  it blows back up soon. You know what I mean? [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10141.0s)]
*  I would try to keep a tight sleeve on it, but [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10143.0s)]
*  it would just fill back up. They try to shoot it with [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10145.0s)]
*  the cortisone so it doesn't [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10147.0s)]
*  come back, but it comes back. So I got [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10149.0s)]
*  that thing drained several times. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10151.0s)]
*  Eventually you're going to have to get that one done. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10153.0s)]
*  Eventually I will. But until I can't [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10155.0s)]
*  walk, I'm walking normal. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10157.0s)]
*  You see me? Yeah. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10159.0s)]
*  Miss Bing is walking normal. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10161.0s)]
*  He's got both of his dogs. [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10163.0s)]
*  But I think they bother him sometimes. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10165.0s)]
*  Like he's standing [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10167.0s)]
*  too long. But he's still [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10169.0s)]
*  training and all that stuff. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10171.0s)]
*  He still kicks the bags and stuff. [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10173.0s)]
*  He's good with the... Kicked the bag. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10175.0s)]
*  The only thing I fucked up with, and I told you that earlier [[02:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10177.0s)]
*  off air, is that I tore my quad [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10179.0s)]
*  and that's a little annoying. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10181.0s)]
*  Because sometimes it will dip. I'll just [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10183.0s)]
*  fall. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10185.0s)]
*  I did it in the kitchen the other day. My wife said, what the fuck? [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10187.0s)]
*  Like 20% [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10189.0s)]
*  of it, in the front of it, [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10191.0s)]
*  if I bend my knee, sometimes it [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10193.0s)]
*  will continue to bend. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10195.0s)]
*  So I just got to be alert of that. I fucked [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10197.0s)]
*  up. You're supposed to step down with your [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10199.0s)]
*  bad leg off regular steps. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10201.0s)]
*  I did it from too high off a couch because [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10203.0s)]
*  I went to do those short jokes you [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10205.0s)]
*  constantly do. I was getting ready. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10207.0s)]
*  You must stop it by one time. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10209.0s)]
*  I saw it coming out of your mouth. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10211.0s)]
*  So I had [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10213.0s)]
*  to reach something. So when I went [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10215.0s)]
*  to step down, I did it with my bad leg and it [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10217.0s)]
*  fucking ripped. Boom! [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10219.0s)]
*  Straight down. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10221.0s)]
*  I just fucking... damn. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10223.0s)]
*  So... And you didn't... was there [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10225.0s)]
*  an option to get it surgically reattached? [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10227.0s)]
*  I went to my PT guy and he goes, [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10229.0s)]
*  oh you tore that thing. Because I was on meds. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10231.0s)]
*  I was on the pain [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10233.0s)]
*  stuff. I don't know what the fuck [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10235.0s)]
*  I was on. But... [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10237.0s)]
*  So maybe it helped with [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10239.0s)]
*  the pain, but it was fucking painful. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10241.0s)]
*  And then I noticed... I didn't know it was [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10243.0s)]
*  deformed. I didn't know what the fuck I did. And then he [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10245.0s)]
*  looked. He goes, look man. He goes, like if there's [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10247.0s)]
*  like a hundred fibers in your leg, you tore like 20 [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10249.0s)]
*  percent of them or something. So it's kind of like what [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10251.0s)]
*  I did to my bicep. But you [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10253.0s)]
*  know, it is what it is. I fucked that up. I can't go back in [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10255.0s)]
*  time and fix it. Could they have [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10257.0s)]
*  if you did it right away? I have no idea. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10259.0s)]
*  I have no idea. Have you ever heard of that? [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10261.0s)]
*  I never heard of it. I know they can do that with your bicep. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10263.0s)]
*  I mean, I had a buddy that had his quad [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10265.0s)]
*  detached and they [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10267.0s)]
*  reattached it and everything. I heard of a dude who got his [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10269.0s)]
*  quad detached from a leg kick. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10271.0s)]
*  This guy did it. Oh my God. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10273.0s)]
*  The leg kick was so severe that it [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10275.0s)]
*  sliced the quad. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10277.0s)]
*  God damn. Yeah, this dude did it [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10279.0s)]
*  shooting on somebody. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10281.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody got it. Fortunately he was [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10283.0s)]
*  on a mat. You know, at least he could have happened [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10285.0s)]
*  squatting or riding. He was [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10287.0s)]
*  an avid bike rider too. How many of those videos have you seen where [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10289.0s)]
*  guys' legs explode when they're doing deep squats? [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10291.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10293.0s)]
*  Man, I don't like that shit. Oh, it drives me nuts, man. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10295.0s)]
*  The way he's training, I got too much ADD [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10297.0s)]
*  for that. I'm afraid I'll [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10299.0s)]
*  like, you know what I mean? Like I could zone out in my jujitsu [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10301.0s)]
*  and I [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10303.0s)]
*  really think my ADD helped my fighting. It kept me in [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10305.0s)]

*  build with calisthenics. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10415.0s)]
*  You just gotta be willing to do some evil shit [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10419.0s)]
*  to yourself. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10421.0s)]
*  This is evil. That's so hard. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10423.0s)]

*  what you in the gym for? [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10437.0s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10439.0s)]
*  how much would that help your jujitsu? [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10441.0s)]
*  Oh, I think that's probably even more. Because [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10443.0s)]
*  it's like so many different movements [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10445.0s)]
*  all at once. Yeah, look at these guys. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10447.0s)]

*  George, I get a text from him. No [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10485.0s)]

*  Star Wars nerd than me. He throws [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10493.0s)]
*  he he's talking about the [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10495.0s)]
*  cartoons and everything. My brother Jamie's [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10497.0s)]
*  big in the Star Wars. Yeah. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10499.0s)]
*  He knows them all. The Mandalorian was fun. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10501.0s)]
*  George is big in the UFOs too. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10503.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Oh, the UFOs? Yes. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10505.0s)]
*  Very interesting. So what about that UFO or [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10507.0s)]
*  the little alien that was in Vegas [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10509.0s)]
*  couple weeks ago? The Vegas thing. Is that real or what? [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10511.0s)]
*  It was like eight foot tall, nine foot tall. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10513.0s)]
*  Hold on. What do you think? Most likely [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10515.0s)]
*  not a true story. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10517.0s)]
*  Most likely. But it might be. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10519.0s)]
*  So here's the thing. If an alien spacecraft [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10521.0s)]
*  did land in your backyard and a ten [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10523.0s)]
*  foot dude got out and you see him and you don't [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10525.0s)]
*  get your phone up in time because you're mesmerized [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10527.0s)]
*  and it just takes off like [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10529.0s)]
*  what happened? Is that [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10531.0s)]
*  real? Okay. Even if it is real, [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10533.0s)]
*  what are you going to tell people? Even if [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10535.0s)]
*  you tell people, no one's going to believe you [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10537.0s)]
*  so you're stuck in this spot. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10539.0s)]
*  Unless you have video evidence of it, [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10541.0s)]
*  I don't know. But I do know that [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10543.0s)]
*  George Knapp, who's like the [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10545.0s)]
*  he's like the most prominent investigative [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10547.0s)]
*  reporter in Las Vegas [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10549.0s)]
*  for UFOs. He's the guy that broke the [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10551.0s)]
*  Bob Lazar case back in [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10553.0s)]
*  the late 1980s. That was a guy who [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10555.0s)]
*  claimed to have back engineered UFOs [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10557.0s)]
*  and it's a very interesting story. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10559.0s)]
*  But anyway, he went to visit these people. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10561.0s)]
*  They made an appointment like on I think it was [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10563.0s)]
*  two different occasions. When he went to their house, they didn't [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10565.0s)]
*  answer the door. Oh, really? Yeah. So, but [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10567.0s)]
*  it also could be they don't want [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10569.0s)]
*  the smoke. They don't want that attention. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10571.0s)]
*  Imagine you're just a regular person. You're not making any money from this. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10573.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, everyone's calling you a liar. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10575.0s)]
*  And then everyone knows where your house is. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10577.0s)]
*  And then people come by, show me the backyard! [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10579.0s)]
*  Show me the backyard! [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10581.0s)]
*  It probably would have freaked them out. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10583.0s)]
*  There's probably a lot going on. On the subject, [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10585.0s)]
*  behind you, because I can't [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10587.0s)]
*  unlook it. Who is this [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10589.0s)]
*  individual getting something up there? I think it's supposed to be me. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10591.0s)]
*  I think it's supposed to be me getting sucked up into [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10593.0s)]
*  a spaceship. Somebody gave me this. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10595.0s)]
*  It's a gift. I don't think that's him. Oh! [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10597.0s)]
*  It's headphones! My bad. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10599.0s)]
*  I thought it was like a Mongolian dude or something. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10601.0s)]
*  Oh, the hair is like a ponytail. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10603.0s)]
*  That's what I swear. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10605.0s)]
*  I got the whole time. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10607.0s)]
*  Oh, now I get it. I think that's supposed to be [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10609.0s)]
*  me getting sucked up into this spaceship. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10611.0s)]
*  Now it makes all the sense. Yeah, this is a gift by [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10613.0s)]
*  Brigham, my friend Brigham. Oh, nice shit. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10615.0s)]
*  He gave me this when I first came here. And so [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10617.0s)]
*  it was so cool, we decided, there it is. You can see [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10619.0s)]
*  it on that image. But then we decided [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10621.0s)]
*  it was so cool, it would be cool behind me. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10623.0s)]
*  So it looks like [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10625.0s)]
*  it belongs here. Shit, man. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10627.0s)]
*  And the club, [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10629.0s)]
*  you having a lot of fun with the club? [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10631.0s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. So much fun. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10633.0s)]
*  That's so wild. And you got, [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10635.0s)]
*  I just know this because I was a huge [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10637.0s)]
*  fan of the [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10639.0s)]
*  Norm MacDonald podcast with Adam [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10641.0s)]
*  Eaget. Yeah. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10643.0s)]
*  They had such a great chemistry. Do you ever see [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10645.0s)]
*  his podcast? Adam's great. And he runs that show. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10647.0s)]
*  He's the telecord there. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10649.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the only reason I know that name [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10651.0s)]
*  is because they had such, do you guys [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10653.0s)]
*  ever see the old Norm MacDonald podcast? [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10655.0s)]
*  It was so, this is it. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10657.0s)]
*  Before it went on [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10659.0s)]
*  Netflix. The Netflix ones are right, [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10661.0s)]
*  but this was so funny. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10663.0s)]
*  And I thought he was a very funny guy. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10665.0s)]
*  I thought they had a great thing going on. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10667.0s)]
*  Adam's very funny. He could be [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10669.0s)]
*  a comic if he wanted to be a comic, but he's a great [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10671.0s)]
*  talent coordinator. He's just a great dude. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10673.0s)]
*  He's just a fun guy to have [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10675.0s)]
*  around. Norm MacDonald was like [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10677.0s)]
*  he was just such a funny [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10679.0s)]
*  comic. Oh my god. He was the [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10681.0s)]
*  best. He was the one guy that [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10683.0s)]
*  I continually just watch and not feel. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10685.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I watch stand up comedy, I [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10687.0s)]
*  get nervous for the stand up comedian. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10689.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10691.0s)]
*  Because you don't want him to bump. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10693.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what it is, but I never got nervous [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10695.0s)]
*  with that guy. Didn't you do it once? [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10697.0s)]
*  Didn't you do it once with Adam Hunter in the episode? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10699.0s)]
*  No, not with Adam Hunter. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10701.0s)]
*  He asked me to do that. He was [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10703.0s)]
*  hosting the show though. No, I think you're thinking [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10705.0s)]
*  if Eve Edwards did it. No, no, no, no, no. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10707.0s)]
*  Adam Hunter was actually the host. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10709.0s)]
*  Dana White looking for a [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10711.0s)]
*  fight. The LA episode, his first [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10713.0s)]
*  episode. Yeah, my first episode. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10715.0s)]
*  Nick the Tooth fucking walked off the show [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10717.0s)]
*  and we needed somebody. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10719.0s)]
*  With the 24 hours. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10721.0s)]
*  Superman. Yep. [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10723.0s)]
*  Nick the Tooth thought that everybody else [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10725.0s)]
*  wasn't really getting tased or something. Was there something crazy [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10727.0s)]
*  like that? Yeah, something like that. A hundred percent. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10729.0s)]
*  Nick the Tooth, when we were doing the show, [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10731.0s)]
*  I would get along with the Tooth. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10733.0s)]
*  He was a funny guy. He was a fun guy to hang with. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10735.0s)]
*  He was kind of goofy, but he was [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10737.0s)]
*  funny, you know. But then you'd go back [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10739.0s)]
*  and you'd watch the episode and see him talking to the camera [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10741.0s)]
*  saying all sorts of shit. [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10743.0s)]
*  So a couple of things happened. One, [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10745.0s)]
*  somebody told him, we all got [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10747.0s)]
*  locked hands together in one of the episodes. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10749.0s)]
*  Me, Dana, and Nick. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10751.0s)]
*  And they had us, [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10753.0s)]
*  they tased us. So we all got [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10755.0s)]
*  fucking tased. And he was the only [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10757.0s)]
*  one being like, stop! [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10759.0s)]
*  That kind of thing. Oh no. So he [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10761.0s)]
*  wanted to save face, I guess. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10763.0s)]
*  Somebody told him that [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10765.0s)]
*  oh, the way they did it, they really [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10767.0s)]
*  fucked you, man. You got more of the voltage [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10769.0s)]
*  than some bullshit. Which is [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10771.0s)]
*  obvious. Dude, we all got fucked up from that. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10773.0s)]
*  We all got. So [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10775.0s)]
*  that's one. And then another thing was [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10777.0s)]
*  him saying that we set him up with me and him [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10779.0s)]
*  doing a grappling match. [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10781.0s)]
*  Which was fucking the furthest thing [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10783.0s)]
*  from the truth. He was the one talking shit. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10785.0s)]
*  I remember when I first started shooting the show, I was [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10787.0s)]
*  a little chubbier. So I think he thought I was on [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10789.0s)]
*  the couch. And Nick the Tooth won [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10791.0s)]
*  some shit. He won some like the old man [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10793.0s)]
*  worlds and whatever it was. I think he just won [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10795.0s)]
*  something recently. Yeah, he's a talented jiu-jitsu guy. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10797.0s)]
*  He does like the barambolos and all that shit. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10799.0s)]
*  But back then, what was he? A purple belt? [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10801.0s)]
*  He was a brown belt. So I was [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10803.0s)]
*  watching after the first episode, you know, [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10805.0s)]
*  I was watching the thing. And all of a sudden [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10807.0s)]
*  I see him going, oh, Matt makes me look good. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10809.0s)]
*  He's bald. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10811.0s)]
*  He's always late. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10813.0s)]
*  All we got to do is settle the [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10815.0s)]
*  grappling. Now he said this on the show. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10817.0s)]
*  I remember. I remember being like just [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10819.0s)]
*  dumbfounded. I didn't know what the hell he was thinking of. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10821.0s)]
*  So when I see him the next time, we're on [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10823.0s)]
*  a Danish jet, we're doing the fucking [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10825.0s)]
*  Alaska episode. I go, [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10827.0s)]
*  dude, what the fuck was that? Settle what? [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10829.0s)]
*  So and he was right along with it. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10831.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, we got the tooth now. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10833.0s)]
*  And it's like, dude, I went with the best in the world. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10835.0s)]
*  What the fuck you talking about? [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10837.0s)]
*  But he was gung ho about it. Let's grapple. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10839.0s)]
*  Let's grapple. So we ended up doing [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10841.0s)]
*  the show. And then we [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10843.0s)]
*  were in a jiu-jitsu gym in Alaska. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10845.0s)]
*  So I go, hey, man. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10847.0s)]
*  Fucking, now listen, if anybody had anything to lose, [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10849.0s)]
*  imagine I slip and the motherfucker gets a barambolo [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10851.0s)]
*  on me and I would have something [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10853.0s)]
*  to lose, lose into this knucklehead. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10855.0s)]
*  But no, of course, I, you know, [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10857.0s)]
*  I had my way with him. So [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10859.0s)]
*  you know, afterwards, [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10861.0s)]
*  Dana goofed on him a bunch. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10863.0s)]
*  Dana goofed on him a bunch, you know. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10865.0s)]
*  But I got a text from him, right? [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10867.0s)]
*  And this is the first time I knew there was some kind of problem. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10869.0s)]
*  Hey, Matt, you know, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10871.0s)]
*  it was an honor, this and that. I just have to let [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10873.0s)]
*  you know that I can't let that [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10875.0s)]
*  footage be shown. That's what he said. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10877.0s)]
*  It looked bad for my instructors [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10879.0s)]
*  and this and that. I was wearing their rash guard. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10881.0s)]
*  So I call up, [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10883.0s)]
*  I go to Dana and I go, hey, man, I know [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10885.0s)]
*  you're friends with him. What kind of power does [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10887.0s)]
*  this guy have to say that this shit's not going to be [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10889.0s)]
*  on the fucking air? He goes, [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10891.0s)]
*  not only is that going to be fucking shown, [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10893.0s)]
*  wait till you listen to my fucking commentary. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10895.0s)]
*  Dana goes, not only is that [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10897.0s)]
*  going to be shown. So I go, hey, man. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10899.0s)]
*  So I think he thought he was being set up, [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10901.0s)]
*  but it was nothing like that at all. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10903.0s)]
*  So he was a little bit of a weird dude with that. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10905.0s)]
*  I seen him since and he was cool. [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10907.0s)]
*  He was a likable guy. He was a very likable guy. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10909.0s)]
*  But I think he was, some guys I think on the camera, [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10911.0s)]
*  I think they're a little insecure with how they are [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10913.0s)]
*  portrayed. But it was a weird [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10915.0s)]
*  thing because he was acting wacky, [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10917.0s)]
*  but then he's getting upset that he's being portrayed [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10919.0s)]
*  wacky. So it's like, what the fuck are you talking [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10921.0s)]
*  about? So then he ended up getting to [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10923.0s)]
*  like a fucking, a fucking [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10925.0s)]
*  pushing match with Dana or [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10927.0s)]
*  something at a concert. I think they were at Chili Peppers [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10929.0s)]
*  concert. And [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10931.0s)]
*  I think it was actually Joe Silber [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10933.0s)]
*  went up to him and asked him [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10935.0s)]
*  what was it like to roll with Matt? [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10937.0s)]
*  And he said, that fat fuck set me up. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10939.0s)]
*  I go, hey, wait a minute. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10941.0s)]
*  I go, whoa, what the fuck? [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10943.0s)]
*  I wasn't there. I heard about this. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10945.0s)]
*  So Dana called me. I was with [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10947.0s)]
*  my wife and she was with me. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10949.0s)]
*  We were celebrating our anniversary in Vegas [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10951.0s)]
*  and we were going to go from there to LA to shoot this [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10953.0s)]
*  episode. And then fucking [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10955.0s)]
*  Dana called me to the office [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10957.0s)]
*  and we were like, yo, we were [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10959.0s)]
*  left the show. What the fuck are we going to do? [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10961.0s)]
*  We were booked at that. Where did we do the [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10963.0s)]
*  Laugh Factory? Laugh Factory. Yeah. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10965.0s)]
*  So I'm not saying [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10967.0s)]
*  I'm not saying you're [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10969.0s)]
*  with all of me. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10971.0s)]
*  But there was one name [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10973.0s)]
*  that popped into my name. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10975.0s)]
*  The first name, I go to Dean, I go to [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10977.0s)]
*  fucking, I go, Dana, I go, yo, what about Dean Thomas? [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10979.0s)]
*  He goes, oh, [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10981.0s)]
*  he's like, there he is! [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10983.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, Dean! Yeah! [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10985.0s)]
*  How'd that go? Not bad. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10987.0s)]
*  Did you write your own material? I wrote my own material. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10989.0s)]
*  And then I have a whole other [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10991.0s)]
*  with Adam Hunter a few times. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10993.0s)]
*  I ain't going to lie, he used the N-word as a [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10995.0s)]
*  crutch a little bit. But that was [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10997.0s)]
*  only his first time. That was my first time. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=10999.0s)]
*  And then he got more comfortable with it. [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11001.0s)]
*  Look at Dana, chubby Dana. Dana's all [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11003.0s)]
*  skinny now. Isn't that wild to see? [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11005.0s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I was literally [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11007.0s)]
*  looking mad up there at Brian Cowell's in the audience. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11009.0s)]
*  I felt, that was fun though. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11011.0s)]
*  I'll tell you right now, I had an adrenaline, I felt [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11013.0s)]
*  so good. I told the people [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11015.0s)]
*  in the rafters too, I'll climb up there, bite your [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11017.0s)]
*  fucking neck! [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11019.0s)]
*  I like the layout! [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11021.0s)]
*  I can get that in you motherfuckers quick! [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11023.0s)]
*  But we had a good time, didn't we Dean? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11025.0s)]
*  That was awesome. That was so much fun, man. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11027.0s)]
*  Fun show you guys did. That was so much fun. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11029.0s)]
*  You guys did a lot of wild shit, right? [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11031.0s)]
*  What about the shark episode? [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11033.0s)]
*  That was a funny one. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11035.0s)]
*  Why would you agree to that? [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11037.0s)]
*  You swam with sharks, you got out as fast as you got in. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11039.0s)]
*  You know what's fucked up? Oh, I went back in. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11041.0s)]
*  You know what's fucked up about that? [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11043.0s)]
*  They are doing everything you're not supposed to do. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11045.0s)]
*  They're chumming up the water, they're on their side, [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11047.0s)]
*  acting like they're seals, [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11049.0s)]
*  wounded seals, [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11051.0s)]
*  to draw the sharks out while we [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11053.0s)]
*  were in the water. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11055.0s)]
*  Now look, we're in there, the best is the camera men [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11057.0s)]
*  on the other boat, right? [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11059.0s)]
*  Charlie told me after, he goes, yo, [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11061.0s)]
*  they said, some of the guys on the boat with them, [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11063.0s)]
*  they go, sooner or later something's going to go wrong. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11065.0s)]
*  These are producers, [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11067.0s)]
*  coming up with these ideas, right? [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11069.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? The chumming? That doesn't sound [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11071.0s)]
*  exciting. No, no, no, that's these guys. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11073.0s)]
*  Hey, again, that was Florida. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11075.0s)]
*  What the fuck, dude? [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11077.0s)]
*  Get me the fuck in there, dude. When I looked underneath, [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11079.0s)]
*  how many people could say, [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11081.0s)]
*  there was a cage, and they go, you don't want to go [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11083.0s)]
*  in the cage, the cage hurts anybody. Yeah, I was like, [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11085.0s)]
*  I want to go in the cage. You don't want to go in the cage? [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11087.0s)]
*  Why? That's what they said. They were trying to get it. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11089.0s)]
*  I think I'll go in the cage. I was like, [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11091.0s)]
*  why don't you want to go in the cage? He goes, oh, the cage hurts people. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11093.0s)]
*  I think these guys are just... Hurts people. Yeah, they were just [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11095.0s)]
*  fucking with us. To get us to do it. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11097.0s)]
*  Listen, just because you can do [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11099.0s)]
*  something doesn't mean, [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11101.0s)]
*  just because you could pay for an [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11103.0s)]
*  experience, doesn't mean you're not going to die. I think we found out [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11105.0s)]
*  about that recently. Yeah, exactly. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11107.0s)]
*  That fucking submarine thing. That's the press [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11109.0s)]
*  saying. That is so crazy. The inventor [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11111.0s)]
*  of the fucking submarine was on it when it imploded. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11113.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Yes. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11115.0s)]
*  The crazy thing is, the guy who invented it, [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11117.0s)]
*  they knew it happened and held it back for five days. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11119.0s)]
*  Why do you think they did that, Roland? [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11121.0s)]
*  Give me the conspiracy theory. Personally, [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11123.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm a good conspiracy theory guy. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11125.0s)]
*  I think there's so much drama going on [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11127.0s)]
*  with the president and his son. This was something [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11129.0s)]
*  to keep the headlines [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11131.0s)]
*  going for a few days, because that's right when he got indicted. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11133.0s)]
*  I mean, I have to go with the clush. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11135.0s)]
*  Guilty and shit. Interesting. We are so [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11137.0s)]
*  easily distracted. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11139.0s)]
*  That was a good one, though, too, for four days. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11141.0s)]
*  It was like, I hope they find them. They only have [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11143.0s)]
*  72 hours left. Yeah, that's true. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11145.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, they were dead. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11147.0s)]
*  They said they heard it, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11149.0s)]
*  because the government apparently... [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11151.0s)]
*  This is what's crazy. They had to sort of [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11153.0s)]
*  admit that they have a top secret acoustic [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11155.0s)]
*  surveillance system. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11157.0s)]
*  Why are you admitting that [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11159.0s)]
*  just because... [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11161.0s)]
*  Are you just admitting it just because [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11163.0s)]
*  you know that there was an implosion? [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11165.0s)]
*  Why would you admit that you have a top secret system? [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11167.0s)]
*  Now it's not top secret. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11169.0s)]
*  Now everybody fucking knows about it. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11171.0s)]
*  Maybe James Cameron did. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11173.0s)]
*  He was the one that said, I knew the Navy heard it. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11175.0s)]
*  They lost comms at the same time they heard [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11177.0s)]
*  the audible bang. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11179.0s)]
*  I'll tell you right now, I wouldn't have done it. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11181.0s)]
*  Look at that. A top secret military acoustic [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11183.0s)]
*  detection system. Not anymore. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11185.0s)]
*  Everybody knows now. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11187.0s)]
*  Everybody knows. The Titanic guy told everybody. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11189.0s)]
*  How crazy is that? He went what? [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11193.0s)]
*  Three times as deep as they did. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11195.0s)]
*  By himself. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11197.0s)]
*  The kind he was with you could pilot around. [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11199.0s)]
*  This one was like an elevator. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11201.0s)]
*  You had one button to go up. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11203.0s)]
*  And they were controlling it with a [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11205.0s)]
*  Logitech remote controller. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11207.0s)]
*  And there was lawsuits. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11209.0s)]
*  There's a lot of whistleblowers that were saying [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11211.0s)]
*  that that hull can't [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11213.0s)]
*  withstand that kind of depth. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11215.0s)]
*  They said the new material, they said the carbon fiber. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11217.0s)]
*  And they didn't even like the design. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11219.0s)]
*  The guy said at least if it was [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11221.0s)]
*  woven it might have worked. They said this was like [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11223.0s)]
*  almost like a spring. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11225.0s)]
*  It was wound. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11227.0s)]
*  The carbon fiber was. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11229.0s)]
*  Back to the shark thing. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11231.0s)]
*  Did you see out of Egypt [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11233.0s)]
*  that guy get beaten [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11235.0s)]
*  by the shark? [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11237.0s)]
*  That was a real life Jaws movie. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11239.0s)]
*  One point you see his feet up in the air. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11241.0s)]
*  It was in the background [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11243.0s)]
*  and he was trying to play like Stand By Me. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11245.0s)]
*  And it's like [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11247.0s)]
*  it is the most horrific thing. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11249.0s)]
*  If I seen that before I wouldn't have done the episode. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11251.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11253.0s)]
*  I looked down when we were in that water and I saw a [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11255.0s)]
*  fucking shark looking up at me. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11257.0s)]
*  I saw that too. I got the fuck out of there. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11259.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11261.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11263.0s)]
*  You're perpetuating the stereotype. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11265.0s)]
*  I don't care. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11267.0s)]
*  It's true. Brothers don't swim. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11269.0s)]
*  There was some people recently in Florida [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11271.0s)]
*  or in Hawaii rather where the husband and the wife [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11273.0s)]
*  were snorkeling and the husband [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11275.0s)]
*  gets out of the water and they're screaming [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11277.0s)]
*  get out of the water. It's because his wife [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11279.0s)]
*  was getting eaten. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11281.0s)]
*  There was a shark that was [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11283.0s)]
*  eating his wife while they were screaming at him to get [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11285.0s)]
*  out of the water. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11287.0s)]
*  Did he get out of the water? Tiger shark. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11289.0s)]
*  But they never found the wife. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11291.0s)]
*  They ate her whole body. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11293.0s)]
*  That happened. My friend Duncan was [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11295.0s)]
*  in Hawaii and that happened like the week [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11297.0s)]
*  before he was there. [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11299.0s)]
*  The week before or the week after, I forget which, but like [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11301.0s)]
*  real close where he was like he was in [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11303.0s)]
*  that fucking water. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11305.0s)]
*  I want to hear about balls dude. You [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11307.0s)]
*  can't swim and you jumped [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11309.0s)]
*  off a fucking cliff into water. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11311.0s)]
*  That's in Hawaii. Hawaii brought [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11313.0s)]
*  it back to me. Did you have [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11315.0s)]
*  life vest on? No. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11317.0s)]
*  You can't because you have to. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11319.0s)]
*  Because the impact, if you hit the water [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11321.0s)]
*  without that it will crush your chest. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11323.0s)]
*  Because we jumped off a cliff. So how the fuck [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11325.0s)]
*  did you get out? Me and you jumped off a cliff. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11327.0s)]
*  That was the episode that [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11329.0s)]
*  Dana didn't jump. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11331.0s)]
*  Did he? No. Dana didn't jump. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11333.0s)]
*  I know a guy who fucked his back [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11335.0s)]
*  up for life doing that. He landed [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11337.0s)]
*  bad. He landed bad. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11339.0s)]
*  Blew one of his discs completely apart. [[03:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11341.0s)]
*  How far is this? [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11343.0s)]
*  This is fun. Oh my god [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11345.0s)]
*  dude. This is fucking awesome though. Come on we have [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11347.0s)]
*  some nice memories. How far was this? [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11349.0s)]
*  How far was this jump? I don't know but I'm in better shape now [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11351.0s)]
*  with my shirt off. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11353.0s)]
*  If you want to see me take my shirt off now I'll show you. [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11355.0s)]
*  God damn. Look at this wayyyyy [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11357.0s)]
*  little chubby guy. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11359.0s)]
*  How many feet do you think that is? [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11363.0s)]
*  I don't know. That's pretty [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11365.0s)]
*  fucking high. But. Oh my [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11367.0s)]
*  god. Oof. Dana [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11369.0s)]
*  was up there? And Dana was [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11371.0s)]
*  up there until the sun went down. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11373.0s)]
*  No way. He never did it. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11375.0s)]
*  All these other people did it and he didn't do it. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11377.0s)]
*  Did anybody get hurt while you were there? [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11379.0s)]
*  No. It was like little kids doing it. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11381.0s)]
*  Dana's pride got hurt. Hello. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11383.0s)]
*  Fuck that. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11385.0s)]
*  Dana was like fuck that. And the best is [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11387.0s)]
*  he was up there for three hours. Really? [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11389.0s)]
*  And we're in the truck. Now first of all he was breaking your balls [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11391.0s)]
*  before that. Yeah. So then we get off that [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11393.0s)]
*  we're in the van on the way back. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11395.0s)]
*  Dana's a little down in his dumps [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11397.0s)]
*  and Dean's starting to be like [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11399.0s)]
*  well he took balls just to get up there. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11401.0s)]
*  I'm like BOOTIS BAD [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11403.0s)]
*  fucking give it to him Dean. Jesus [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11405.0s)]
*  that's so far. He was up there a long [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11407.0s)]
*  time. Two hours and thirty minutes. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11409.0s)]
*  Fuck that. Dana still [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11411.0s)]
*  didn't do it. They cut some shit from the episode. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11413.0s)]
*  I'm sitting there yelling. I go Scott Culkin [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11415.0s)]
*  would do it. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11417.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11419.0s)]
*  Imagine if he did. Holy shit. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11421.0s)]
*  He was up there until the fucking [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11423.0s)]
*  and he had to walk down [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11425.0s)]
*  the walk of shame. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11427.0s)]
*  Oh my god that's hilarious. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11429.0s)]
*  But just to give him a [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11431.0s)]
*  compliment so I don't get fired. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11433.0s)]
*  He did jump on a fucking [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11435.0s)]
*  ball. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11437.0s)]
*  No. Really? He rode a ball? [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11439.0s)]
*  Why? Why don't you guys call me first? [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11441.0s)]
*  I hosted Fear Factor. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11443.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what not to do. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11445.0s)]
*  That's one to not do. If you want to look at him riding a ball [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11447.0s)]
*  it's much better to jump [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11449.0s)]
*  on that cliff than to get on the back of a ball. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11451.0s)]
*  That is so much more dangerous. It's a legit ball. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11453.0s)]
*  Did he do that afterwards? [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11455.0s)]
*  So he felt bad. No he didn't. He did the ball before. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11457.0s)]
*  That's why. Maybe that's why he didn't jump [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11459.0s)]
*  on the water. Because he realized how rich. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11461.0s)]
*  He's like I'm rich as fuck. Why am I doing this? [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11463.0s)]
*  Watch this shit. Oh my god this is Dana? [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11465.0s)]
*  Yeah we both did it. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11467.0s)]
*  I landed on my foot. Look at this. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11469.0s)]
*  This is a real ball. And this thing almost got him. [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11471.0s)]
*  Look at when he lands. [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11473.0s)]
*  Look look look look look look. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11475.0s)]
*  That could have landed on him. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11477.0s)]
*  I'm so lucky. That's just luck. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11479.0s)]
*  That's just dumb luck. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11481.0s)]

*  to anything with this. My arm will just pull right out of the socket. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11509.0s)]
*  He just had slices [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11511.0s)]
*  all over his arm. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11513.0s)]
*  They just reconstructed him so many times. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11515.0s)]

*  I didn't ride the bull. I did the clown though. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11523.0s)]
*  You did the clown. That was even scarier. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgrbS9FdKvk&t=11527.0s)]
