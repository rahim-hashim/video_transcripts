# Joe Rogan Experience #2195 - Andrew Huberman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spq8UKib3Zw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  All right, we're good.
*  Mr. Huberman, how are you, sir?
*  Good to see you.
*  Good to see you.
*  So what were you just saying about dog breeds that, like we're talking about Carl, like
*  the little bulldog breeds have more mastiff than wolf?
*  Yeah, so.
*  So mastiff is a different thing?
*  Well, so.
*  Don't they all come from wolves?
*  Yeah, they all originate from wolves, but then dog selection has been twofold, mainly
*  for phenotype like morphology, the shape we call it, and then temperament, right?
*  So there's this chart, it might be a little hard to find online, about the dosing of wolf
*  versus mastiff genetics, essentially.
*  And there's a bunch of other things woven into dog genetics.
*  First of all, cool point, dogs are among, I don't know if they are the most, maybe whales
*  are the most, but they are among the greatest variation in body size within a given species.
*  You think of chihuahua and great guinea, and it looks like it's dosing of the genes controlling
*  IGF-1, which makes sense, growth hormone.
*  They're kind of wild, right?
*  Like we got some big humans and some smaller humans, but not like dogs.
*  Chihuahuas and then what are those enormous shepherd dogs?
*  Those, what are those ones, those insane dogs that used to fight off wolves?
*  What the fuck are those things called?
*  Those gigantic hairy things?
*  You know what I'm talking about?
*  We've talked about them before.
*  They're terrifying looking dogs.
*  Yeah I mean, just the-
*  What's it called?
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Oh yeah, those things.
*  What the fuck is that thing?
*  What is that called again?
*  Well we've seen it before.
*  Doesn't it say the name of the dog?
*  Well find the name of those dogs because there's, Brian Callan knows all this shit.
*  So I have a colleague at Stanford, Sue McConnell, who-
*  Jozo dogs?
*  No, that's not it.
*  There's a name for them though.
*  Oh, Tibetan Mastiff.
*  Tibetan Mastiff.
*  Yeah.
*  They're really furry and they're like 250 pounds.
*  Look at that puppy.
*  That's seven weeks old.
*  That's so crazy.
*  I wonder how many they have in the litter.
*  How could they have very many?
*  Yeah, it's gotta be just a few.
*  Poor mama.
*  So I have this colleague at Stanford, Sue McConnell.
*  She's won best in show at some of the big events for Pooleys.
*  She breeds horses and she's into that whole-
*  What's a Pooley?
*  The Pooleys are the ones that look like Rastafarian dogs.
*  You know, their eyes are covered.
*  They're amazing.
*  They're amazing.
*  And she had this chart on her door.
*  I was going to meet with her about something.
*  She handles a lot of undergraduate education at Stanford.
*  And I see this chart and the chart essentially shows
*  the dosing of kind of the original wolf line genes
*  versus more Mastiff heavy genetic background.
*  And there are a lot of breeds on this chart,
*  but it essentially shows up in the following way.
*  The dogs that are more sight and scent, right?
*  And with longer snouts.
*  Like a shepherd.
*  Like a shepherd have more heavy dosing
*  of the wolf gene still in them.
*  Then you get to the shorter snout,
*  kind of snub nose like the French bulldog,
*  the English bulldog and some Mastiff breeds, pugs, right?
*  And the amount of wolf in them is like nil to none.
*  And then what's happened-
*  But wait a minute, but they all start off as wolves.
*  So they have some genes that relate
*  to the wolf origin lineage, right?
*  But over time they've been bred,
*  for instance, the English bulldog.
*  But all dogs originally come from wolves.
*  Yes, that's my understanding as well.
*  Even Mastiffs.
*  That's right, that's my understanding.
*  But then as they were cross-bred with different dogs, right?
*  So for instance, like the English bulldog,
*  that line came from the crossing of essentially pug,
*  like short snout, right?
*  But with Mastiffs or with dogs
*  with heavy Mastiff genetic dosing, why?
*  Well, the idea was the short snout gives them a good lever
*  for holding onto things, right?
*  And the Mastiff genes lead to, and we know this for sure,
*  both of the droopiness of the face,
*  it also relates to less presence of pain receptors
*  in the front of the body.
*  Okay, so if you've ever had a bulldog
*  where you know their feet can be really sensitive,
*  but their face, you can hold onto those jowls.
*  My bulldog, Costello, would go picking up stuff at the beach
*  and he'd occasionally get a fish hook in his mouth
*  and it looked super painful and he's like, oh.
*  So not very many pain sensors in the face.
*  They have a disruption or mutation in the gene
*  that controls the elasticity of skin.
*  That's why they have the droopiness.
*  And they are brachycephalic, short snout.
*  That's why they're not very good breathers
*  and they essentially have sleep apnea.
*  That's why they have a bunch of rubs.
*  Okay. They snore like a motherfucker.
*  They do, so they do snore a lot.
*  I can attest. Like Carl does.
*  It's crazy.
*  And so what were dogs being selected for?
*  Well, unless you're showing dogs, dogs were selected
*  for the kind of work they were capable of doing.
*  Like sheep dogs are great herders, this kind of thing.
*  But when people essentially designed, bred up
*  and cross-bred to get the English bulldog
*  or the old English bulldog,
*  which doesn't have as much of an underwrite.
*  So I had an old English bulldog.
*  So whereas the English bulldog is elbows out.
*  So inward rotation, the thing we're all supposed to not do
*  and underwrite, the old English bulldog looks like this.
*  It looks more like a pit bull.
*  Looks more like a pit bull.
*  And they were originally used for bull baiting,
*  for grabbing onto the nose of the bull,
*  getting the bull super aggressive
*  and then being able to let go and get called off
*  and coming back to their protector.
*  And then basically then it was to rile up the bull
*  for bull fighting.
*  So you can still find some of this stuff online.
*  You can find some old descriptions,
*  in some cases, even some old videos.
*  But of course now bull baiting with dogs is not allowed.
*  Dog fighting, everybody looks down on.
*  But then if you start asking about the toy breeds,
*  what were the toy breeds,
*  quote unquote, designed for bred for?
*  They were basically designed to sit next to you.
*  Some of them will seek out,
*  like the terrier breeds will find vermin, right?
*  They'll go find rats.
*  They're really good ratters actually.
*  Jack Russell's are great.
*  Jack Russell's are great ratters.
*  The West Highland terriers, the Westies,
*  the Cairn terriers, they're always,
*  they're really great hunters for little things, right?
*  And the amazing thing is that
*  when you start looking at the different breeds,
*  it was basically human selecting
*  on the basis of mostly behavior and phenotype shape
*  and thinking, oh, like I want a smaller dog
*  that will just sit near me.
*  Or I want a small dog that will like kill rats
*  and sit near me.
*  No, I want a big dog that's gonna guard.
*  So you start breeding for pain tolerance.
*  I start breeding for loyalty and aggression.
*  And a guy that I think was on your podcast
*  a long time ago, Sam Sheridan.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, in a fighter's heart,
*  there's a great chapter where he talks about,
*  I think it's dog fighting in the Philippines.
*  And he talks about how brutal that sport is,
*  which indeed it is.
*  But he talks about the love between the owner and the dog
*  can predict, and of course the dog and the owner,
*  it's reciprocal, one presumes,
*  that the strength of that relationship
*  predicts how hard the dog will fight for the owner.
*  And he uses this as kind of a parallel construction
*  for why, and you tell me if this is true or not,
*  that many of the fatalities in boxing
*  were the consequence of, sure, 15 round
*  as opposed to 12 round fights,
*  but also when the corner man or the coach was the parent.
*  And so it gets into this very complicated psychology.
*  I actually think that's a really terrific book
*  because I think it speaks to a lot of
*  really interesting aspects of bonding between humans,
*  bonding in that case between animals and humans.
*  Of course, dog fighting,
*  I don't know if there are many things
*  that people look down upon
*  as much as they look down upon dog fighting,
*  but he speaks to the relationship
*  between the dog and the owner as a loving one,
*  which was super surprising to me.
*  Anyway, that's a bit of a tangent,
*  but I don't know, maybe it's possible to find that chart.
*  I don't want to send you on a ridiculous expedition,
*  but if you just say, so jeans, that's a simple one.
*  Okay, this one, the one I'm thinking about
*  is a vertical one that was in Science Magazine
*  or Scientific American, but it's wild.
*  Again, I don't want to send you on an expedition
*  that has us paused, but.
*  Yeah, sorry about that.
*  No worries, but it's just,
*  we get a rough understanding of it all.
*  Yeah, so now when I see like, okay, like a collie,
*  like I see a collie down there, I think long snouts,
*  so probably has a better nose than a mastiff breed.
*  You can ask an owner, how good is their vision?
*  Are they a sight hound or a scent hound?
*  And of course they're both, but some dogs,
*  like I'm really interested now in part because of you
*  and Kam Haines and others about dogs that hunt
*  or go on hunts, and like the coon hound breeds are amazing.
*  I've always wanted a red bone coon hound.
*  Their ears waft up smell.
*  That's why they're so long.
*  I didn't know that.
*  Yeah. I didn't know that.
*  Yeah, the reason why they have those long floppy ears
*  is as they're running, their ears are wafting up smell
*  and it gives them a better sense of the chase.
*  Oh, amazing.
*  I read this incredible description of why dog scent
*  and sense of smell is so much better than ours.
*  There's a guy named Noam Sobel who's been on my podcast,
*  he's over in Israel, who claims that human olfaction
*  is just as good as dog olfaction.
*  But how do they outdo us?
*  The frequency of sniffs and this is really cool.
*  You know those little notches on the side of the nose,
*  like our nostrils look more or less symmetric.
*  They have those little notches.
*  They create little vortices for the dog
*  so that the scents stick around.
*  They're actually getting longer exposure to a scent.
*  So when they're getting something like 10 or 20x
*  the exposure to the scent in the olfactory bulb
*  and are able to assess both directionality,
*  they can do right nostril, left nostril.
*  They can sense odor plumes to steer in one direction
*  or another.
*  But Noam has done these crazy experiments
*  when he was back at Berkeley,
*  where he had people's hands mitted, eyes covered
*  so they can't sense touch, they can't see,
*  everything's covered and they can follow a scent
*  of chocolate buried seven inches below the ground.
*  What? Yes.
*  And you can see this.
*  This you can find if you say tracking, sorry,
*  my goal wasn't to come here and send you on these.
*  These people have a nose like Ari Shaffir.
*  Oh boy.
*  Or Adrian Brody.
*  Oh my.
*  If you say kind of Berkeley chocolate tracking Sobel
*  or something like that, it should come up.
*  So he would do these aerial views of these people
*  tracking these scents on the ground.
*  And it turns out people are really good at this.
*  They can track a scent.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you- Sniffers show that humans can track scents
*  and that two nostrils are better than one.
*  Okay.
*  So if you, but if you go images, I think you'll probably-
*  Chocolate scent through the grass.
*  Yeah, if you go images, and then I'll lay off the Google.
*  They will track scents.
*  So if you go to images, damn it, and you just say Berkeley,
*  just say, there it is.
*  Right, so they compared the tracking of a scent hound,
*  of a blood hound to human tracking of a scent buried
*  in the case of the blood hound, it wasn't buried.
*  So that person, what do they have a mask on?
*  Yeah, they got a mask on,
*  their hands are covered with thick gloves.
*  They can only use, the only thing exposed
*  are their nostrils.
*  But that line, that yellow line is not a line
*  with a bunch of chocolate on it.
*  It's buried below the surface.
*  I always thought it was above.
*  And then when I talked to Nomi, he said, no, no,
*  they buried the chocolate scent.
*  And people were able to track it
*  like a hunting dog tracks a pheasant.
*  Well, how did they bury it if it's grass?
*  I think they cut a trench and then they covered it up.
*  Wow.
*  So he insists that this thing that you see
*  in all the textbooks, which is that humans have,
*  like one thousandth or something
*  of the number of olfactory receptors,
*  that's total bullshit.
*  Really? Total bullshit.
*  In fact, our friend, who by the way, wanted me to say,
*  hello, Rick Rubin, turned to a good friend of mine,
*  who's the chair of neurosurgery
*  of a major medical school department, not Stanford,
*  I promise, and said, what percentage of the things
*  in medical textbooks?
*  Okay, this is Rick asking, this chair of neurosurgery.
*  What percentage of things that you find
*  in medical textbooks, basic and advanced,
*  do you think are false based on your understanding
*  of what we actually know now
*  compared to when the textbooks were written?
*  And he said, 50%.
*  And then Rick said, yep.
*  And then Rick said, I was wide-eyed too.
*  And then Rick said, and what is the extent of impact
*  on treatment of patients modern day?
*  And his answer was one word, incalculable.
*  Oh my God, 50% strong.
*  50% in currently used medical textbooks,
*  meaning that the literature has been updated
*  with new understanding, new scientific papers,
*  but it has not yet been incorporated
*  into the medical education.
*  Let me say something,
*  because I know that bears have insane senses of smell
*  that are many times stronger than a bloodhound's,
*  and famously can smell people from 100, 200 yards away.
*  There's gotta be levels to it.
*  And I just can't imagine that a bloodhound
*  doesn't have a better sense of smell than a person.
*  Right, so they absolutely have a better sense of smell
*  under the definition that they use it,
*  they use the same number of receptors differently.
*  In other words, the resolution of your vision
*  and a mouse's vision is dramatically different.
*  The resolution of your vision is very sharp
*  at the fovea towards the center of your eye,
*  and actually towards the periphery,
*  anyone can just do this,
*  you wiggle your fingers out here in the periphery
*  and you can't see any detail, right?
*  As you move that forward, you can see detail.
*  So, and that's because the density of pixels, so to speak,
*  in the retina is much, much higher near the fovea,
*  near the center than it is at the periphery.
*  So what he's saying, what Noam Sobel's laboratory has found
*  and others have found is that the number of pixels,
*  the potential for olfactory resolution in humans
*  and in bloodhounds is essentially the same.
*  This is his argument.
*  But the bloodhounds sniff much more.
*  So it's the equivalent of having their eyes open much more,
*  right, in the exam, so to speak.
*  They have these vortices that are created
*  by the structure of their nose and nostrils.
*  So they have longer exposure.
*  And in the case of the bear, for instance,
*  I don't know how many olfactory receptors they have
*  relative to a human or a bloodhound,
*  but that the bear is likely spending a lot more time
*  and can pull more air, perhaps, I don't know,
*  but is using the mechanical aspects
*  of the olfactory system differently.
*  In fact, and here's, now I'm recalling the experiment
*  that led to this conclusion
*  that humans have exceptional olfaction,
*  which is that there's a particular compound
*  that when introduced to a swimming pool,
*  people can detect a difference in the smell of the water
*  at a dilution that is outrageously small.
*  Like skunk spray.
*  Like skunk spray.
*  Forgive me because I'm not remembering
*  the name of the chemical,
*  but he said you can essentially add a drop of this
*  to a swimming pool and then people can smell
*  the difference between the water.
*  And so his argument is not that humans are walking around
*  sensing all these smells consciously
*  as well as a bloodhound or as well as a bear,
*  but that we have a tremendous capacity for olfaction
*  that the chocolate tracking experiment exemplifies,
*  but it requires some removal of our most dominant sense,
*  vision, and hearing our second most dominant sense.
*  And in that case, tactile orientation as well.
*  And so the idea is that,
*  we have an amazing olfactory apparatus.
*  In fact, he makes the argument and there's evidence
*  for the fact that as soon as people meet,
*  and they've done these beautiful experiments,
*  people meet, they shake hands,
*  and the next thing they do, they tend to,
*  within about a minute, they wipe the scent
*  of the other person on their face, typically.
*  I guess I wasn't paying attention to this.
*  And they don't realize it?
*  People don't realize this.
*  They just do it subconsciously?
*  Yeah.
*  So, mercaptans.
*  Also known as theo, how do you say that?
*  Theoles?
*  Oh, where is it?
*  I'm getting the theo.
*  Sulfur containing organic compounds
*  with a strong unpleasant owner.
*  They are colorless and yellow as liquids.
*  It can be flammable.
*  Mercaptans are found in nature and in living organisms
*  as a waste product of metabolism and in oil and gas.
*  They are also present in certain foods,
*  such as some nuts and cheese
*  and in decaying organic matter and marshes.
*  Right, so we're probably sensitive
*  to the odors that matter.
*  That can kill us.
*  That can kill us.
*  Theo has this idea that I think
*  is starting to take hold in real data
*  that we are constantly sensing our own odor plumes.
*  That we smell ourselves a lot of times per day.
*  That's actually very normal behavior.
*  Right.
*  There are all sorts of ways people do that
*  that nobody talks about.
*  Yeah, you like to check a sniff.
*  People check their sniff.
*  And it's an indication of hormone status, immune status.
*  When you have babies or puppies,
*  you're looking at like, oh, is a good poop or a bad poop?
*  You're also paying it people,
*  some people will smell the poop.
*  I'm not a proponent of that.
*  But we're constantly sensing the scent and taste of,
*  for instance, our partner saliva, right?
*  Actually, an ex-girlfriend of mine wrote to me recently,
*  I don't know what this question represented,
*  but she said,
*  do you think that when you become unattracted to somebody,
*  the taste of their mouth becomes bad to you
*  or the other way around?
*  When you become unattracted?
*  Unattracted.
*  I guess she might've been dating somebody
*  and like maybe it had fallen out of favor
*  and she was kind of not attracted
*  and she was sort of noting that-
*  The taste of their mouth is-
*  Their mouth no longer,
*  like it tasted kind of aversive now as opposed to before.
*  I bet that's in your mind.
*  I bet you don't like them anymore.
*  Cause if you're really in love with someone,
*  you don't even care if they have bad breath.
*  You still wanna kiss them.
*  That's true too.
*  Cause you just love them, you don't care.
*  That's true too.
*  Yeah. That's true too.
*  You don't care if they smell, you don't care.
*  You just, you love them.
*  But if they're gross and then they smell,
*  you're like, ugh.
*  Right.
*  You fucking stinky asshole.
*  This is a mule deer skull.
*  So, you know, this is not as extreme as an elk,
*  but you get a look at the internal.
*  Okay.
*  If you look inside of that and you see-
*  Oh yeah.
*  Cause they can wind you from a hundred yards away easy.
*  So see this spongy stuff.
*  I don't know if they can see it on video.
*  There's this spongy stuff there.
*  That's something called the cribriform plate.
*  The cribriform plate is a bunch of Swiss cheese,
*  like thin bone and the olfactory neurons,
*  which basically sit like right behind your,
*  the back of your nostrils.
*  They send axons,
*  their little wire like connections back into the brain.
*  And when somebody gets hit hard on the head,
*  that cribriform plate shears it.
*  And that's why people become anosmic.
*  They lose their sense of smell.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that picture.
*  There it is.
*  Now what's amazing about the olfactory neurons
*  is that they are among the very few neurons
*  in the human and other mammalian nervous system
*  that regenerates throughout the lifespan.
*  So there's a little area of your hippocampus
*  where there's some neurons that everyone makes a big deal of
*  that frankly don't do a lot to regenerate
*  throughout the lifespan, so-called neurogenesis,
*  new neurons.
*  But the olfactory neurons,
*  even though they're central nervous system neurons,
*  just like your retinal neuron or your cerebral cortex,
*  they can regenerate throughout the entire lifespan.
*  And they do.
*  Every time somebody takes a head hit
*  or there's some shearing off of these axons, excuse me,
*  they regenerate.
*  Now under conditions like,
*  we saw this a lot during COVID
*  where people were complaining about loss of smell.
*  We see this when people age.
*  Some people are thinking that loss of smell
*  may be a correlate, not the cause, but obviously,
*  but a correlate of age-related cognitive decline,
*  dementia, and Alzheimer's, things like that.
*  There are a few things.
*  Actually, I think I recommended it
*  to a couple of friends of ours.
*  Now there's very little data on this,
*  but I will say, and I'll catch heat for this,
*  but these days I catch heat anyway, so I don't care.
*  There are good data, in my opinion, small amount of data,
*  but let's call it decent enough data to explore
*  that alpha lipoic acid at 600 milligrams per day
*  during the time when you're starting to lose your smell
*  might rescue some of that smell.
*  So if someone's getting COVID
*  and they start to lose their sense of smell,
*  Or any viral infection
*  where they are losing the sense of smell.
*  What other viral infections cause a loss of sense of smell?
*  Well, anything that clogs the sinuses, certainly,
*  but there are influenza viruses that do this.
*  Now I know as we're saying this, that some people are saying,
*  in fact, Noam Sobel told me that he felt that the data
*  about alpha lipoic acid were kind of on the weak side,
*  but when people are losing their sense of smell and taste,
*  it's really scary.
*  I mean, it's one of those things where, you know,
*  you kind of feel like so much of pleasure in life,
*  unbeknownst to us is-
*  Yeah, especially with food.
*  Oh, I'll never forget when I got a viral infection
*  and I took and I lost my sense of smell
*  and I ate a handful of blueberries, which I love,
*  and it just tasted like bags of water.
*  I was like, oh, goodness.
*  Like, I don't, there are worse things in life.
*  Was it COVID that you lost your smell with?
*  It was, it was.
*  And I did the smell training,
*  which has also been shown to work
*  because these olfactory neurons, this is amazing,
*  their survival is activity dependent.
*  They require electrical activity
*  driven by sniffing and smelling.
*  It is true that the behavioral tool of taking a lemon
*  and really just like getting it close to that nostril
*  and just really trying to get
*  whatever little whiff of lemon you can,
*  and then taking, you know, your coffee
*  and getting that little whiff of coffee,
*  whatever little remnants of smell that you can get in there
*  has been shown to improve the survival
*  and eventually the durability
*  of not just the olfactory neurons, but scent.
*  In other words, the behavioral training works.
*  There are, the alpha-lipoic acid thing is debated.
*  The thing about alpha-lipoic acid is diabetics
*  and people with blood sugar issues probably shouldn't take it.
*  They can kind of reduce blood sugar a little bit.
*  But when I had that happen, lost my sense of smell,
*  I was like, listen, I want my smell back.
*  So I took 600 milligrams of alpha-lipoic acid
*  and I was doing the scent training.
*  I was like sniffing lemons, sniffing coffee,
*  sniffing Parmesan cheese,
*  sniffing anything that was pungent that I could recognize.
*  And my smell came back in a couple of days.
*  But then again, I don't know,
*  cause I didn't run the control experiment,
*  whether or not it would have come back anyway.
*  Is it only positive smells?
*  Or what about if you use smelling salts
*  or something like really intense?
*  Well, smelling salts I've never used, but-
*  Uh-oh, well guess what?
*  Do we have some?
*  We've got some right here.
*  I'd be willing to try.
*  Are they legal?
*  Before I do something illegal?
*  Oh yeah, 100%.
*  All right.
*  Yeah, these are totally legal.
*  All right, I'll give it a shot.
*  These are the one, this is ah.
*  This is a Juju Mufu, who is a real athletic freak
*  who uses these.
*  I don't know him, but shout out to him
*  because this is the strongest shit we have ever tried.
*  I will just-
*  This one's sealed too.
*  So this is-
*  I'll just try a little bit.
*  Oh, you're gonna get all up in there.
*  Come on.
*  This is like the cold plunge.
*  I got a funny story about the cold plunge
*  to tell you later, but that relates to you.
*  But-
*  We'll get to that in a moment,
*  but you're about to get your mind blown here, son.
*  So this stuff is so strong that it's sealed in this bag.
*  Wait, is it gonna kill my olfactory neurons?
*  No, you'll be fine.
*  It's so strong that even though it's sealed in this bag,
*  I have to rip this bag open.
*  And-
*  Oh my.
*  God damn, my hands are slippery.
*  Got a knife?
*  Okay.
*  It's so strong that I've broken the seal of this bag.
*  Just slightly, look, it's still kind of sealed.
*  Look, you could smell it through the bag.
*  Well, let's try to know him.
*  Just give a sniff.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Right?
*  Okay.
*  This bag is still sealed.
*  I haven't even cut the bag yet.
*  So as somebody who had a laboratory
*  with chemicals in it for a long time,
*  now we run clinical trials on humans,
*  but so no more chemicals in my lab.
*  Okay, now take a sniff.
*  You learned to waft it.
*  You learned to-
*  The bottle.
*  The bottle is sealed.
*  Oh, it's not even out of the thing.
*  No.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  The bottle's still sealed.
*  Oh, this is just the beginning.
*  You know when you go to a park
*  and you go into a public bathroom
*  in a park that has a pool?
*  He's getting nervous.
*  Yeah, I'm getting nervous.
*  You know, I'm no Elon Musk,
*  but I saw what happens when people do substances on this.
*  That was legal in the state of California.
*  And I think everybody's getting a little out of hand.
*  Yeah, he got in trouble.
*  You're like, we're down here in Texas.
*  Okay, now again, this is totally illegal.
*  Now what you're gonna do here is take this.
*  Isn't it amazing that the word legal
*  when said fast sounds like illegal?
*  Yeah, legal.
*  And then you go, wait, what did you say?
*  It's totally illegal.
*  And vice versa, right?
*  Yeah.
*  So what do I do?
*  Unscrew the cap.
*  Oh look, it's my initials.
*  Ah.
*  Unscrew the cap.
*  All right.
*  Put it about six inches from your nose,
*  take a big sniff.
*  Get in there.
*  All right.
*  Yeah, baby.
*  Let's go.
*  Now imagine if you had COVID.
*  Wait, wait, wait, hold on,
*  let me just kind of experience that for a second.
*  Yeah, take it in.
*  Well, you know what's interesting?
*  Or it wouldn't be fair.
*  You know what's interesting?
*  Here we go.
*  Oh.
*  Oh.
*  Oh man.
*  The fresh ones are so powerful.
*  I can feel it in my eye because the sinuses run.
*  Oh, now imagine if you had COVID,
*  you could smell it over there, huh?
*  I imagine if you had COVID and you lost your sense of smell,
*  like this might be the key to getting it back.
*  As long as it's not killing olfactory neurons.
*  I don't think it's killing it.
*  You can smell everything after it.
*  I mean- That's true.
*  My own, I'm obviously biased.
*  So-
*  Because I like that thrill for whatever reason.
*  We haven't-
*  I enjoyed that.
*  Thank you.
*  We have in the green room of the mothership.
*  You prompted me to take several new experiences
*  that we can talk about.
*  But one other thing before I forget,
*  I know I go down these like nerdy rabbit holes here,
*  but when I did the smelling salts a moment ago,
*  I sniffed with both nostrils,
*  but it came in mainly through my left nostril.
*  Right.
*  And so I asked Noma Sobol,
*  what's the deal with this left nostril, right nostril stuff?
*  You know, you have the yogis,
*  the switching of the nostril things.
*  Here's what's wild.
*  This is so wild.
*  It turns out that every two hours or so,
*  the dominant breathing nostril switches.
*  Now- Really?
*  Now that could be interesting
*  or that could not be interesting, right?
*  There are a lot of things in biology that happen,
*  but like what is the meaning?
*  Turns out it's a direct reflection of a shift
*  in your so-called autonomic nervous system
*  from parasympathetic dominant to sympathetic dominant,
*  meaning from more relaxed to more alert.
*  And this is happening periodically throughout the day
*  like a seesaw, enduring sleep.
*  So this whole thing with the yogis of, you know,
*  breathe through one nostril or the other nostril,
*  look, the olfactory bulbs,
*  there's a lot of crossing over of information
*  at later stages and even some early stages
*  once the information gets to the brain.
*  So that whole thing is probably a little bit like weak sauce,
*  but this idea that you're breathing easier
*  through one nostril or the other
*  is reflecting an underlying brain state and body state.
*  That is absolutely true, he tells me.
*  Wow.
*  And the last thing is you said,
*  why would bears or bloodhounds have such better smell?
*  Well, in the case of a bear,
*  the size of the olfactory bulbs
*  and the amount of brain real estate
*  devoted to processing that information is much more.
*  So we have a huge visual cortex.
*  Most of our brain, frankly,
*  is devoted to vision and to movement.
*  Whereas, you know, the brain of,
*  let me think of like a turtle, it's mostly movement.
*  They have very little cerebral cortex.
*  Maybe that's not the best example,
*  but certainly in a scent hound,
*  the olfactory bulbs are much bigger
*  than they are in a sight hound.
*  And both of those have olfactory bulbs
*  that are much, much bigger than Jamie's bulldog over there.
*  Those guys sniff all the time,
*  but they're mostly snorting trying to get sense in.
*  Their sense of smell is much, much worse
*  than Marshall's, than your dog.
*  Because Marshall's a retriever.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That makes sense, because he can smell his ball.
*  Like if I throw his ball and he misses it,
*  he just starts doing a circle
*  and then he finds it with his smell, which is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Smells his ball, you know?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, incredible.
*  So what Noam is saying is not that humans have smell
*  that is as good, but that when you push the conditions,
*  you can reveal a heightened sense of smell
*  that most people don't think humans have.
*  Now, as I say this, there are a lot of people out there,
*  and it's usually women who are like,
*  oh no, I can smell everything.
*  I can smell the subtlest difference.
*  And so it may be something related to maternal behavior.
*  It might be something related to estrogen.
*  It might be something in the Y chromosome
*  that suppresses that.
*  We don't know.
*  But some people are very olfactory.
*  They can smell when somebody's not feeling right
*  or when they're not feeling right.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's absolutely the case
*  that we're constantly taking the chemicals off other people
*  through shaking hands, through hugging,
*  rubbing them on ourselves,
*  analyzing our own smells unconsciously.
*  I always say that I can smell bullshit.
*  You probably can.
*  But I don't know if I really can smell it,
*  but when someone's lying, I feel like there's a smell.
*  There could be the stress.
*  You know, we talk about stress as one thing,
*  but stress is the dosing of different levels of cortisol,
*  epinephrine, people that are pathological liars.
*  They can probably do it without evoking those things.
*  Then you have things like pupil size,
*  bigger the pupils, more arousal, right?
*  The more stressed somebody is.
*  We know this, right?
*  That's why if somebody takes a stimulant,
*  the pupils would get huge.
*  There's a thing that people do when they're full of shit
*  where they're anticipating your response
*  in a different way.
*  When someone's telling the truth,
*  if you tell me the truth,
*  you seem relaxed to my response.
*  Like you're telling, even if it's something
*  that you're not proud of, you're telling me the truth.
*  This is the thing.
*  When someone's lying, it's almost like they're waiting
*  to see how you buy it.
*  So it's like their defenses are up.
*  They're counterpunched quick.
*  Well, they're selling it.
*  They say it and they're like, does he buy it?
*  Like you feel the does he buy it
*  and like, ooh, you're full of shit.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Let me think about this.
*  So you are able to sense their anticipation
*  of your response.
*  It's like they've got queued up some counter,
*  some evaluating whether you're going yes, no, or maybe.
*  Yeah, but it's not reliable.
*  Like I just speak to be completely honest.
*  I've been bullshitted before,
*  but I think I'm better at it than most.
*  And I think maybe that's because I've had more conversations
*  with people than most people have,
*  but it's not a hundred percent.
*  Sometimes people are full of shit and you're not sure
*  or you have your defenses down.
*  I mean, I've been badly, badly manipulated before.
*  Yeah, it happens.
*  Yeah, especially if you like someone.
*  You know, that's part of the problem.
*  You don't want them to be full of shit.
*  Yeah, and some of the best manipulators,
*  certainly in my experience,
*  are people that have really figured out
*  the combination lock of the things
*  that I have felt deprived of and they come in.
*  And those tend to be unique things, right?
*  That you can't get out anywhere, you know?
*  And boy, somebody said to me recently,
*  like there are certain categories of humans
*  that I just, I can't be seduced by.
*  I'm not talking about just sexual seduction, right?
*  Right, right, right.
*  I'm saying it just can't be seduced by.
*  And then there are some people that just are able
*  to get past that force field.
*  And so I consider myself pretty good at threat sensing,
*  except in that domain, where like my threat sensing
*  is like the equivalent of a stuffed animal.
*  My friend Tony always says that erotic and psychotic
*  are so close to each other that, you know,
*  like it crosses over back and forth.
*  And I think there's something to that too,
*  that some of the craziest people
*  are also some of the sexiest people for some weird reason.
*  Like you wanna be with them,
*  even though you know they're dangerous,
*  like they're crazy.
*  Like there's some weird thing going on there.
*  Almost like you want wild kids,
*  because wild kids could survive better.
*  That's an interesting one.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that the,
*  well I'm listening to a really good book
*  that a really smart person suggested to me
*  called Five Types of People That Will Ruin Your Life.
*  And I only wish I had read it years ago.
*  And here's the main takeaway,
*  that there are about 10% of people out there,
*  and it cuts across all the standard labels
*  of like narcissists and borderline and all that.
*  Like they include some of that, but they depart from that.
*  And they just focus on what,
*  there's a guy who's a psychologist,
*  it's written by a guy who's a psychologist,
*  he's worked a lot on conflict resolution over the years,
*  courtroom type stuff, et cetera.
*  And he says, in this 10% of people,
*  they are high conflict people,
*  but within they like conflict, they feed off it.
*  They like drama, they like conflict, they like creating it.
*  But within that category, it's pretty evenly divided,
*  he claims between women and men.
*  And then there's a further division
*  where about half of them play passive and victim,
*  but are highly manipulative.
*  They use other people to try and basically harm.
*  And then the other 5% are very like aggressive and abrasive.
*  And so he has this great set of protocols,
*  I love protocols, that are essentially like,
*  don't move in with, marry or get engaged to,
*  or have a child with somebody in the first year.
*  And this cuts in both directions,
*  just don't make that agreement in year one.
*  As well as for any behavior that kind of cues those senses,
*  gets your spidey senses up, like you were describing,
*  ask yourself, would 90% or more of people
*  do that behavior?
*  And if it's a no, like you have to pause.
*  In other words, what he's saying in this book
*  is that most people are actually pretty healthy,
*  but that most of the woes of the world
*  are created by about 10% of people,
*  which he calls these high conflict people.
*  But they don't always come out high conflict,
*  like screaming and yelling.
*  They're often very tactical and manipulative
*  and very vindictive.
*  They'll leverage victimhood,
*  they'll leverage a lot of different things.
*  And again, cuts across men and women equally, he claims.
*  And again, I don't know the data behind this book,
*  but the book itself just feels like a very useful thing
*  that everybody should know about.
*  So I'm enjoying reading this book going,
*  oh my God, I wish I had this book years ago.
*  Plus realizing like, oh yeah, like we always hear this,
*  like most of our problems come from a very small set
*  of people and things.
*  And most of society's problems.
*  And so who are these people?
*  So we tend to call them narcissists or sociopaths
*  or psycho, you know, but those labels,
*  while very useful in the clinic,
*  I think have been overused in the general public.
*  And like, we're not clinicians,
*  we're not diagnosing anybody.
*  And so, but difficult people that can ruin your life,
*  abound, but it turns out it's only about 10%.
*  So, and it has some very specific protocols
*  of how to deal with the people who are more outwardly
*  aggressive versus play victim, et cetera.
*  Very useful book.
*  I think it's, yeah.
*  It sucks that you have to think that way though.
*  Can't you just enjoy someone?
*  Enjoy their company?
*  If they're in the 90%.
*  Yeah, but that's the problem.
*  You can zig when you should have zagged
*  and you run into a 10% or-
*  Take a year.
*  Yeah, but a year's a long time though.
*  Also people can learn like what you tolerate
*  and don't tolerate and hide certain types
*  of behavior from you.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, which can be a real issue.
*  Oh, I've definitely experienced that.
*  And it's, and again, I think we are often,
*  I mean, you mentioned that the relationship
*  between erotic and manipulative and crazy,
*  or just erotic and crazy.
*  I think there's also that when we finally receive
*  the sorts of, I don't know, love or affection,
*  it's not always sex.
*  It's not always sexual, right?
*  Like somebody like, I don't know, like rubbing your feet
*  or paying a little extra attention to what you say
*  or something, for some people, that's intoxicating.
*  It's a lot of it is paying attention to you.
*  A lot of it is like listening to what you have to say
*  or asking you questions about your thoughts
*  and your feelings, which a lot of people
*  are unaccustomed to.
*  And that's intoxicating to people.
*  Because a lot of people just want to talk about themselves.
*  So when someone wants to talk about you
*  and really is asking questions about your feelings,
*  that can kind of manipulate you in a weird way.
*  Yeah, it almost feels like a parental type of care
*  that we're probably wired to look for.
*  I mean, I always marvel at this
*  and also just kind of shake my head and go,
*  why, why did God design us this way?
*  But the circuitry in our brain
*  that creates infant child attachment
*  is the same circuitry that is repurposed
*  for all other relationships in adulthood.
*  It's not like you get your childhood attachment stuff
*  and then you go, okay, well, you're like 15, 16,
*  you're moving on in the world, you're hitting puberty,
*  you're starting to date a bit, whatever.
*  Now let's work with a different set of mechanics,
*  a different set of algorithms.
*  No, it's the same set of algorithms repurposed.
*  We know this based on the studies
*  of infant parent attachment and on the basis
*  or infant caretaker and on the basis
*  of studies of romantic love.
*  It's the same circuitry.
*  So you're using a set of algorithms and circuitry
*  that were designed for one thing in a very different context.
*  That's interesting and it's probably makes sense
*  why a lot of men with like very overbearing mothers
*  seek overbearing wives.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I've learned so much recently about just how it is
*  that we can lose our vision of other people.
*  And I think this thing that we hear like manipulation,
*  it often sounds like, oh, it's like really tactical
*  if someone's rubbing their hands.
*  I think the really tricky part about it is
*  I do think that most people in the world
*  are just like doing their best to feel safe,
*  to get their needs met.
*  I think there are very few evil people.
*  But in this sort of pattern
*  of repurposing childhood attachment patterns
*  and then people bringing that forward
*  into their adult attachment patterns,
*  I think what ends up happening is that,
*  people quote unquote, trying to get their needs met,
*  oftentimes like the worst ones,
*  sometimes it's called trauma bonding,
*  but they kind of go lock and key
*  or somebody identify somebody that's really healthy
*  and they're like, them, I'm going to latch onto them
*  because like they're healthy.
*  And you'd say, well, the healthy person
*  should be able to spot all the landmines.
*  But if somebody is able to really tap into like
*  something you didn't have
*  or something that just feels like oxygen, right?
*  Goodness gracious.
*  You could be the smartest, most well acclimated person
*  with the best parents or whatever upbringing,
*  which most people aren't,
*  but some people do have that
*  and still fall kind of into this fog
*  that is like, gosh, you want to be with this person,
*  but it doesn't feel good, that mishmash.
*  And I think the thing I've learned clearly
*  is that when you feel that trepidation, run, don't walk.
*  Like it's not like the gray zone is actually the thing
*  to just exit fast.
*  Gray doesn't mean like hover and check it out
*  and like run some experiments here.
*  A ticking bomb.
*  Get out.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Run.
*  Just run.
*  Yeah.
*  Just run.
*  It's also, I think there's some people
*  that are very sheltered
*  and they've been well taken care of
*  and they're not accustomed to manipulative people
*  and they're not accustomed to dangerous people.
*  And so they don't know, I've seen that before
*  both with people choosing the wrong friends
*  and people choosing the wrong partners.
*  Yeah, that certainly hasn't been my pattern.
*  Not that I had the hardest upbringing,
*  but it was, I always say easier than some harder than others,
*  but I always had great friends, great friendships,
*  but my threat sensing,
*  it wasn't always great in romantic relationships for sure.
*  I've also had some great relationships.
*  I think what tends to happen is that if we're very busy,
*  we have this tendency to be easily manipulated
*  by certain things that are unusual
*  that we just that really feel like extra oxygen to us
*  or just feel so nourishing.
*  And because I think people always
*  or will often default to sex.
*  Like it's all about sex.
*  Depending on who you are,
*  like sex is either more or less readily available to you.
*  Like I think that for some people it's nurturing,
*  like to a certain form of nurturing.
*  And then there's also this thing of
*  we know how to survive certain things
*  so they don't feel as dangerous.
*  So people who've had like very overbearing
*  or complicated childhoods or abusive childhoods,
*  sometimes they're set to perceive danger
*  at way too high a threshold.
*  Right. Right.
*  So their perception of what's dangerous
*  is like way too high.
*  And so they walk into even still dangerous situations,
*  but they don't think of them as dangerous.
*  And they're like, oh, I can navigate this.
*  They're good at navigating difficult people
*  or they're good at navigating borderline people
*  or something like that.
*  I think it's also exciting, which is part of the problem
*  is that people like excitement.
*  And if you have a boring life
*  and a life that doesn't have a lot of stimulation in it,
*  and then you find someone, even if they're bad for you,
*  but they're exciting, there's some conflict,
*  some something, there's fights and breakups
*  and then make-ups, which are exciting.
*  And so then you get locked into this stimulation pattern,
*  which is, or I've seen that multiple times with people.
*  It's a real problem.
*  Do you think it's more of a problem with people
*  that like excitement and adventure and are super curious,
*  but like excitement and adventure?
*  So I'm thinking comics.
*  I'm thinking people who like high intensity sports
*  that they seek relationships that are higher intensity
*  because I've received great advice from people like Rick
*  who've said, your relationship should be a sanctuary.
*  That should be where peace is.
*  And actually I don't pay a lot of attention to Instagram
*  kind of little mottos and things,
*  but someone sent me one that I was like, yes,
*  but feels so true, which is that men eventually settle
*  where they feel peace.
*  Yeah, I think that's probably the healthiest way to do it.
*  But I think people like, like I said,
*  I think people like stimulation.
*  And I don't think a lot of people are stimulated
*  by their day-to-day existence.
*  I think they're bored.
*  I think a lot of people are just like trudging along
*  every day.
*  And then when someone comes along
*  that makes you excited in your life,
*  someone who's just a little wild or a little crazier
*  or maybe some lady's got a bunch of tattoos,
*  like look at her, like, whoa.
*  People get excited by people
*  that are a little bit dangerous.
*  Yeah, it's this idea that anything could happen.
*  They could do anything.
*  They're risky people.
*  Someone's got tattoos on their hands.
*  Like Jesus, what is she doing?
*  Yeah, you and I both have a lot of tattoos,
*  but I've intentionally kept it off the hands
*  and neck and face. I thought about doing my hands.
*  But the face is a real problem.
*  Like that's a little wacky.
*  But I have a lot of friends.
*  Like Jelly Roll's a good friend of mine.
*  He's got tattoos all over his face.
*  Post Malone, good friend of mine.
*  I think if you're a musician.
*  He's got a bunch of written shit all over his face.
*  Yeah, I mean, they're the nicest people.
*  The thing about Jelly Roll and Post is like,
*  once you talk to them, once you're talking to them,
*  you don't see the tattoos anymore.
*  You just see the human.
*  It's just like them wearing a shirt.
*  It's like, no, it's nothing.
*  It's normal.
*  And things have changed a lot.
*  Like I was born in 75, right?
*  So I'm heading towards 50 quick.
*  Back then, tattoos on the face was crazy.
*  One of my childhood heroes,
*  and somehow by the grace of God,
*  he's become a close friend of mine.
*  Tim Armstrong, lead singer from Rancey,
*  has a tattoo of a spiderweb on his head
*  and a spider on his neck.
*  And I remember seeing him when I was a kid at a show
*  and being like, that dude's scary.
*  And Lars Fredricksson from Rancey says,
*  skunks on his forehead.
*  They're super nice guys.
*  Travis Barker's a super nice guy.
*  His whole head is fucking tattooed.
*  Yeah, Tim and Travis do transplants.
*  And you see those guys, you're like,
*  well, now I think it shifted a little bit.
*  But back then, I remember thinking like,
*  that's gnarly, that's a tough guy.
*  And certainly Lars is a tough guy, and Tim too.
*  But I remember seeing it,
*  like you only saw it on bikers and gnarly punk rockers.
*  People that had checked out of society completely.
*  Mohawk used to be, you're not getting a job.
*  A nose ring used to,
*  remember when a nose ring or an eyebrow ring,
*  you go into Starbucks
*  and the person would have it covered up.
*  Because they weren't allowed to have it.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Now I see medical students with eyebrow rings
*  and nose rings and stuff.
*  So things have definitely changed.
*  Yeah, we're a little bit more open-minded to decorations.
*  But it is a thing though,
*  that you're taking a giant ass chance
*  by tattooing your hands.
*  Well, a friend of mine who's admittedly
*  is a psychologist said,
*  tattoos are largely an expression
*  of what you feel on the inside put to the outside.
*  And I was like, that sounds good.
*  Yeah, it's like a-
*  Sort of, I don't know.
*  Just art.
*  I like art.
*  I like art on my walls.
*  I like art on my arms.
*  I like art.
*  There's some Rogan tattoos out there.
*  I saw Lex Friedman face tattoo.
*  There's a bunch of Lex Friedman face tattoos.
*  That's so good.
*  That's so good.
*  He just had a birthday.
*  Oh, you did too.
*  Happy birthday.
*  Thank you very much.
*  And Lex, happy birthday.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of,
*  that's the weirdest one is tattoos of people's faces
*  on your body forever.
*  And there's, I don't know how many of them are me.
*  There's thousands of them.
*  I mean, I used to post them on Instagram all the time,
*  but then I thought I was encouraging people
*  to get my face tattooed so that they can,
*  I'd put it up on my Instagram, but it's kind of crazy.
*  There might be some reward loop circuitry going on there.
*  100%.
*  Before I forget this, can I ask you this?
*  The people that are into this smelling salt stuff,
*  they're power lifters,
*  and they take a big sniff of that stuff
*  before they lift weights.
*  Why would that help them?
*  Adrenaline.
*  Adrenaline.
*  Yeah.
*  So a couple of more things about olfaction.
*  And by the way, I love this stuff.
*  This is so wild,
*  because it's the most primitive part
*  of our brain and nervous system.
*  We were chemical sensors before we were light sensors.
*  We were sensing chemical environments.
*  Is this a safe chemical environment?
*  And we evolved from that.
*  We know that, for instance,
*  memories that are associated with smell,
*  like the people will say,
*  the smell of my grandmother's kitchen,
*  or somebody's hands, my grandfather's hands,
*  those memories stick with us longer than anything,
*  because the olfactory bulb has a direct line
*  to a couple of structures in the brain.
*  So we have an olfactory bulb,
*  which is the main thing for smell.
*  Then there's something called the accessory olfactory bulb.
*  It sort of divides into primitive smells
*  that are like, aversive, getaway quick.
*  Those tend to go through a really fast line
*  through the olf accessory olfactory bulb.
*  Takes us straight to the amygdala,
*  to the piriform cortex that says,
*  move your body and face away from that.
*  Like I didn't sit there and on the smelling salt,
*  it's like, boom, getaway.
*  It's like a reflex.
*  It's like in fish,
*  there's this thing called the mouth neuron,
*  where you touch on one side of the body,
*  what does the fish do?
*  It goes the opposite direction.
*  Big, huge neuron, hardwired circuit.
*  Well, they have those lateral lines that detects sounds
*  and things and vibrations in the water.
*  They're sensing, electro sensing at a distance.
*  And these mouth neurons are incredible.
*  You touch, boom, the fish heads the opposite direction.
*  Doesn't go like, oh, are you another friendly fish?
*  You want to mate?
*  They go, I'm out of here.
*  Oh, and then they check you out.
*  Right?
*  And so it's a reflex for safety.
*  The olfactory system has these two pathways.
*  The olfactory bulb for kind of like,
*  oh, is this black rifle coffee?
*  And then there's the smelling salt one
*  that goes through the accessory olfactory bulb,
*  straight to the amygdala,
*  which is associated with threat detection and other things,
*  straight to the piriform cortex, and then to a motor circuit.
*  Boom, turn the head the other way, get out, exhale.
*  Don't inhale more.
*  Aversive, okay?
*  So the thing about smell is that, you know,
*  it's got these very hardwired components, okay?
*  And they're set up for either a pedative,
*  like, hmm, let me explore more, sniff in more,
*  versus as opposed to aversive behaviors,
*  like get me the hell away.
*  And these brain areas are among
*  the more ancient brain areas.
*  Now, when I say ancient,
*  people nowadays start picking apart at like,
*  well, it's not just limbic and cortex.
*  The cortex is part of limbic.
*  That's all true.
*  But if you look at our brains
*  and you look at the brains of like a turtle or even a snake,
*  all the stuff we're talking about right here are all,
*  they're not exactly the same, but they're all present.
*  When you get to humans,
*  what you really add is a lot of cerebral cortex
*  for the thinking and association stuff.
*  Like, you know, I've been here before,
*  so I'm a little bit less, you know,
*  like looking around as much as I did last time,
*  like things that, you know,
*  context-dependent learning, context-dependent stuff.
*  Whereas all the highly reflexive stuff
*  is going to be hardwired,
*  circuitry you find in every animal, every person.
*  And you need to divide things
*  into three different responses in humans, okay?
*  In order to survive.
*  Yum, I'm going to move toward it.
*  Yuck, I'm going to move away.
*  And meh.
*  There's basically only three motor responses to anything.
*  Yum, yuck, or meh.
*  Now there's a matter of degrees,
*  like you might see somebody you really like,
*  you want to, I don't know, Joey Diaz or something, you know?
*  You see him, like you want to run over, see him, right?
*  So there's an repetitive circuit moves you towards it.
*  See something that's a little odd, you might pause.
*  I don't know what that is.
*  Or something aversive,
*  like something happens in the parking lot,
*  and you're like, I'm getting the hell out of here.
*  So the brain, as complex as it is,
*  needs to divide things into one
*  of three different motor responses,
*  forward, pause, or retreat.
*  I was playing with Jamie's dog out there before.
*  I was like, I couldn't get him to back up.
*  So it's kind of cool about the bulldog.
*  You charge him and he just goes,
*  I'm like 20 times his size.
*  But he's just like.
*  Well, he's also never experienced anybody
*  being mean to him.
*  Yeah, how could you?
*  Except a few dogs, apparently.
*  But most of his experiences are play.
*  Like he knows he can just run up to you
*  and bite you and you play with him.
*  Right.
*  So you said about why the smelling salts and adrenaline.
*  So here's the deal.
*  When we have this aversive response,
*  the move away, the yuck response, get me away.
*  There's a parallel response in the brain and body
*  of the release of epinephrine, adrenaline.
*  It's the same thing.
*  Sorry for the dual naming.
*  Epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing?
*  Same thing.
*  Long, complicated, boring history
*  as to why it's named two things.
*  Nor adrenaline, nor epinephrine, same molecule.
*  So let's just call it adrenaline for sake of simplicity.
*  Adrenaline is released from the adrenals in the body
*  and it's released from a area in the brain
*  called the locus coeruleus,
*  which sends out a bunch of little wires, axons,
*  to sprinkler the brain with adrenaline.
*  And both systems work in parallel.
*  So when you smell something aversive, it goes, inhale.
*  Okay, olfactory, certain olfactory neurons,
*  cue that to the excessory olfactory bulb,
*  bam, straight to the amygdala.
*  Amygdala sends a signal,
*  down to the adrenals atop the kidneys.
*  They release adrenaline, sends a,
*  believe it or not, a signal up to locus coeruleus.
*  It sprinklers the brain with adrenaline.
*  And you just had within a couple hundred milliseconds,
*  you just got a parallel adrenaline response
*  in brain and body that allows you to do what more easily?
*  Move, to move.
*  Now you're ready for motion, you're ready for movement.
*  In fact, I'm sure if you put that
*  under the deepest sleeper's nose,
*  the middle of the night, they're going to wake up
*  like a gunshot went off.
*  They used to give it to boxers
*  when they got hurt in the corner,
*  they'd give them smelling salts and wake them up.
*  Yeah, because one of the best painkillers
*  is adrenaline.
*  That makes sense.
*  Because you've been hit hard before.
*  Isn't it amazing how little it hurts when it happens
*  and how much it hurts later?
*  Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  That's the thing that's weird about fights.
*  Like while they're happening,
*  your shins are getting battered, things getting hurt,
*  and you don't really feel much.
*  Yeah, adrenaline.
*  Unless you get kicked hard to the body.
*  The liver shots, doesn't matter
*  how much adrenaline you have pumping.
*  There's something about getting hit in the liver.
*  The liver, when you get hit like right here,
*  if you get kicked or punched right here,
*  it's a crazy feeling.
*  It just shuts everything off.
*  It's real weird.
*  Your body just shuts off.
*  I've seen these images of somebody just melt.
*  It looks like they melt.
*  And it looks like they take a few paces
*  and they're ready to counter punch or something,
*  and then it hits slowly.
*  I don't know.
*  Well, some shots go away.
*  So some pain, if you get punched in the gut
*  and you're tidying up in anticipation, it still hurts.
*  It hurts.
*  But then you move a little bit and then you're okay again.
*  But the liver is the opposite.
*  The liver, you get hit,
*  and then there's this sharp pain and a delay,
*  and then,
*  everything just shuts off.
*  It's very hard to fake that you're fine and move away.
*  You see telltale signs, one thing guys will do,
*  all the time when they get hit in the liver,
*  they drop their right arm down
*  and they pin it to their body.
*  So maybe they're fighting like this,
*  they're moving, they whacked in the liver,
*  and you see them do like that and they're still moving,
*  but they can't help it.
*  They have their arm,
*  because they know one more shot there and they're fucked.
*  So they barely can keep a poker face and move around,
*  but there's telltale signs that you see
*  that are just instinctive.
*  You see them just drop their hand.
*  And a lot of times guys will use that
*  to set them up with a head kick.
*  So like they'll hit you a bunch of,
*  a good example of that is Islam Makachev
*  and Alexander Volkanovsky.
*  He hit him with a left kick to the body
*  multiple times in that fight
*  and then fired off one to the head and knocked him out.
*  So it's like they're just hiding this.
*  It's like slow, deep pain.
*  You see the leg come up and it's very hard to recognize.
*  There's a kick called the question mark kick
*  and it's called the question mark kick
*  because in Taekwondo we used to call it
*  a fake front kick roundhouse kick.
*  And what it is is you're lifting the knee up
*  as if you're kicking to the body in a straight line
*  and then you whip it over and go like that
*  and turn it into a roundhouse kick.
*  Pull up Glaube Faitosa.
*  Glaube Faitosa was the best at it.
*  So much so that a lot of people started calling it
*  the Brazilian kick because this guy was a K-1 champion
*  who had the most flexible hips
*  and the craziest question mark kick.
*  And he would literally bring it up and down over the guard.
*  So your hands would be up this,
*  like you think your hands are protecting your head.
*  He would bring it up around like this
*  and drop it down on your head and knock people out.
*  It's so wild because to this day,
*  I don't know anybody who can kick as good as him
*  with that kick.
*  To this day he has the best highlight.
*  There's a lot of people that are really good at that kick.
*  But Glaube had a very unusual flexibility of his hips.
*  Watch this, look at this.
*  Well that's just a regular one,
*  but he's got some of them that go over the,
*  this is some of his highlights.
*  Look at that, see how it does that?
*  See how it just goes up and around?
*  It almost looks like his knee just kind of.
*  Yeah, watch this, watch this.
*  He's gonna do it in slow motion.
*  Watch the whip of it, look at that.
*  That's so crazy.
*  So you don't even know it's, look how he, just whip it down.
*  And it's just, there's a lot of people
*  that are good with that, but he was the best at it.
*  I mean, the best.
*  It was just weird to see how he could do it.
*  I'm always amazed how people can kick standing so closely.
*  Oh yeah, well Glaube was,
*  it's just flexibility of the hips.
*  It's leg dexterity.
*  But the way he could do it, man,
*  it's just the finest question mark kick of all time.
*  I mean, here's knocking out Semmy Schilt,
*  who is seven feet tall with it.
*  I mean, it was bizarre to watch that kind of flexibility.
*  And also bizarre that no one else seems to have really
*  kind of captured that technique as well as he did.
*  And Glaube used to fight, I mean, this was like,
*  hey, well there's Israel Adesanya, a really good one too.
*  And still has a really good one.
*  Look at this one, wow.
*  But that's a little bit more straightforward.
*  I mean, that's like straight to the chin
*  and it's a beautiful kick.
*  But the way Glaube used to do it,
*  it would go over the top and down.
*  See that?
*  Like that is so crazy.
*  I can't do that.
*  I've been throwing kicks my whole life.
*  I can't throw it like that.
*  I'm always watching their eyes and these fighters eyes.
*  It's amazing to me, like years ago,
*  I saw a Mayweather fight and it was obviously on pay-per-view
*  and he was getting paid for sure, right?
*  That was his thing.
*  But it was always amazing me in the slow-mo,
*  like where he would slip punches by like centimeters.
*  And they may think that like his depth perception
*  and the depth perception of fighters,
*  successful fighters must just be exquisite.
*  Because I mean, like slipping at that distance
*  with just a chin movement.
*  That's one thing, but it's also pattern recognition.
*  You've been doing it so many times
*  and you know.
*  So really good fighters, one of the things that you see
*  is they don't just charge out in the first round.
*  The first round is like a feeling out process.
*  So you're downloading a lot of data points.
*  You're downloading foot movement
*  and a lot of guys watch tape and they download it from that.
*  But then you don't really know
*  until you're in there with a person.
*  So they're downloading positions.
*  They're downloading what a guy does.
*  Like if you pivot to the left, does he move forward?
*  Does he move back?
*  Does he throw the left hook?
*  Does he throw the right hand?
*  What does he do?
*  And how good is he at closing distance?
*  Does he try to fire from where he's at
*  or does he skip forward and fire?
*  Does he give any telltale signs?
*  Does he telegraph?
*  So there's a lot of things that a fighter looks for.
*  Mayweather had some of the best counter punchers
*  in the history of the fucking sport.
*  He was so good at like staying in the pocket.
*  So he was an elusive guy.
*  There.
*  Yeah, insane.
*  Or there's he slipping.
*  Pattern recognition, pattern recognition.
*  So he knows that left hook is coming.
*  And so look how straight he throws that right hand.
*  See how straight he threw that?
*  So Canelo is throwing these big wide punches
*  and Floyd is just cutting them off at the path
*  and then moving his head out of the line
*  of those hooks that come his way.
*  So do you think it's conscious?
*  I'm obsessed with this notion of unconscious genius.
*  Like different domains of super high performance
*  where the people don't exactly know how they do it,
*  but they do it.
*  Well, you know how you do it,
*  but you've also done it so many times in the gym
*  and in fights that it's second nature.
*  So you're not thinking of it as you're doing it.
*  One of the things about countering people is,
*  and I used to, when I was in my prime,
*  when I was fighting all the time,
*  I would throw kicks and they would land
*  before I even knew I was gonna do it.
*  Because someone would do something
*  and as they would do something,
*  I instinctively knew because of pattern recognition,
*  there's gonna be an opening.
*  Like say if some guy lifts his left leg,
*  if he's standing with his left leg forward
*  and he lifts his left leg
*  and he's coming towards me with his left leg,
*  I know that he's balancing on that right leg
*  and that the left leg is coming this way.
*  And if I spin and catch him,
*  I can catch him as his momentum is going this way
*  and I'll catch him that way
*  and it'll double the power of the punch or the kick.
*  Did somebody teach it to you?
*  Cause there, there's like a conscious awareness
*  of how you do it.
*  I think this notion of pattern recognition,
*  it's interesting cause earlier we were talking
*  about pattern recognition for finding people who are lying.
*  You have this pattern recognition thing that,
*  you're not saying it's perfect,
*  but like you can sense something.
*  There's things that,
*  and so it's a combination of things
*  that we aren't always aware of.
*  That's the unconscious part of the unconscious genius thing
*  that I'm referring to.
*  And so there's this idea like our brains
*  are pattern recognition prediction machines.
*  And so do you think, like in other words, two questions.
*  Do you think Mayweather was ever pulled aside and said,
*  listen, pay attention to their left shoulder
*  and keep your eye on his right eye.
*  I'm just making-
*  100%.
*  Okay.
*  And were you ever told, hey, if his left leg comes up,
*  that means he's bouncing on his right.
*  So you need to prepare a counter attack or an attack.
*  So that's where drills come in.
*  Okay. So you do drills and you do drills constantly.
*  And one of the things that Mayweather's father
*  was a great fighter.
*  Mayweather's father fought Sugar Ray Leonard
*  back in the 1970s when Sugar Ray was in his prime
*  and gave him a hell of a fight.
*  And his brother or his uncle rather, his uncle Roger
*  was Roger Mayweather, the black mamba.
*  He was a great fighter.
*  So he grew up as a child around some of the best boxers
*  in the world.
*  And so he was constantly seeing the successful motions
*  that they did and constantly seeing them exploit weaknesses
*  in other fighters and then constantly sparring.
*  So in sparring, you're not just fighting
*  when you're sparring, but you're just sort of
*  downloading data.
*  You're downloading data points for a real fight.
*  And then you're doing drills where a guy will,
*  some guys they'll do it with mitts.
*  Well, they'll throw a hand at you
*  and they'll slip and encounter.
*  Here, let me show you this.
*  This is guy Ilya Toporya.
*  And Ilya Toporya is one of the absolute best fighters
*  in the world.
*  He's the current UFC featherweight champion.
*  And the dude is just fucking phenomenal.
*  But when you, one of the thing that's phenomenal
*  about him is his technique.
*  His technique is perfect.
*  There's like no fat in his technique.
*  There's no wasted movement.
*  So when an opportunity presents itself,
*  everything is so fast because the technique
*  is so streamlined.
*  But like look at how he hits the pads.
*  And when you watch how he hits the pads,
*  and Mayweather is a great example of that as well.
*  Did I send it to you?
*  No, didn't go through?
*  I totally sent it.
*  I sent it to you on a text message.
*  Really?
*  I sent it twice?
*  You got it?
*  Okay.
*  Ilya Toporya, like I said,
*  some of the best hands in the sport,
*  current UFC featherweight champion,
*  and knocked out Volkanovsky,
*  who was maybe the greatest of all time.
*  Watch him hit the punches.
*  Look at this.
*  See how he's moving his head when the guy throws punches?
*  Just like that.
*  And then he's like,
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  I'm gonna throw a punch.
*  Punches, just slipping, just slightly.
*  It's like total economy of movement.
*  And the speed, man.
*  The fucking speed of that.
*  Look at the hand.
*  Look at the hand speed.
*  Fucking incredible.
*  I mean, if you know how difficult that is to do
*  and do it that fast,
*  give me that sound again.
*  Let me hear this.
*  I mean, these are like five, six punches a second.
*  Yeah, it almost sounds like,
*  it almost looks like it's sped up
*  by one and a half times.
*  But it's not.
*  And just phenomenal technique.
*  But see how those punts,
*  it's like they're not even talking.
*  So when he's throwing the mitts at his head
*  to get him to duck,
*  there's no communication.
*  He just sees that hand coming towards him
*  and he's ducking.
*  He sees this hand coming towards him and he's ducking.
*  It's all like slight slips away
*  and it's slight motions,
*  which is all you need to get away from a punch, right?
*  You just, you don't wanna move too far.
*  You're wasting a lot of energy and you can't counter attack.
*  One of the best things about Floyd
*  and one of the most brilliant things about him,
*  he's one of the most elusive fighters of all time,
*  but he didn't move around.
*  He stood right in front of you
*  and you couldn't fucking hit him.
*  That's true mastery of space and true mastery of technique.
*  He was, in my opinion,
*  he's the best boxer that's ever lived.
*  Yeah, I mean, I'm not qualified to rank people,
*  but I watched when he was making that ascent towards,
*  it ended up being 50, you know?
*  He just fought last weekend, this weekend.
*  Yeah, he fought a match against John Gotti's grandson,
*  which is crazy.
*  That's scary for a lot of reasons.
*  Yeah, for a lot of reasons, right?
*  This is the second time they fought.
*  The first time they fought, it ended in a brawl.
*  Like a bunch of people jumped in the ring.
*  It was crazy because they stopped the fight
*  because they were talking too much shit to each other
*  and holding on to each other too much.
*  So the referee stopped the fight
*  for whatever reason, I don't know.
*  And then this fight was even crazy too,
*  because the first referee was terrible
*  and the referee said Floyd Mayweather
*  hit him behind the head.
*  Absolutely incorrect call.
*  Floyd threw a right hand and it caught him
*  on the side of the head and the referee claimed
*  that it was behind the head.
*  So Floyd fired the referee in the middle of the bout.
*  He stops the bout, he's like,
*  get the fuck out of here, get out of here.
*  Because he's the promoter also.
*  Well, I guess.
*  I mean, also it's Floyd Mayweather.
*  Like, what's the referee gonna do?
*  Fuck you, you know, I'm gonna stop the fight.
*  Also, they're in Mexico City, like you could get killed.
*  Like, just get out of the ring, buddy.
*  So Floyd throws this punch and he's 100% correct.
*  The punch landed at the side of the head,
*  it's a right hook, it's a perfect punch.
*  And the referee was saying, watch the back of the head.
*  He's like, what the fuck were you talking about?
*  That wasn't the back of the head.
*  And so he kicks the guy out
*  and they bring in a different referee
*  who finishes the fight.
*  It was insanity.
*  And Floyd won.
*  It was an exhibition.
*  It's kind of a bullshit money grab, honestly.
*  You see the punch?
*  That's the punch right there.
*  It's just a right hook.
*  See, same back of the head.
*  So Floyd's like, get the fuck out of here.
*  Just get out of here.
*  Fuck you, get out of here.
*  He's like, get the fuck out of here.
*  And if anybody's qualified to say get out of here,
*  it's fucking Floyd Mayweather, the best boxer of all time.
*  He's 100% correct.
*  That referee made a giant stupid error.
*  He's like, get out of here, get out of here.
*  He's like, get out of the fucking ring.
*  This is his domain.
*  Yeah, and he's right.
*  Everybody watching it is right.
*  No one thinks it's a bad punch.
*  So let's see it again.
*  We can see it one more time.
*  It's a counter right hand.
*  Let's do it.
*  We can see it in slow motion.
*  So he throws the punch, boom.
*  It's just a perfect right hook.
*  It's a perfect right hook.
*  What it does is a punch that goes over the top of the guard
*  and catches him in the exposed area of the head.
*  It's a perfect punch.
*  And for the referee to interfere there,
*  and also it's literally like someone
*  who probably doesn't know how to box at all,
*  telling the greatest boxer of all time
*  that what he's doing is wrong, which is just bananas.
*  So he got rid of the guy in the middle of the fight.
*  But he's still doing these bouts at 46 years old,
*  still boxing these young kids.
*  Again, John Gotti III, who is a very good
*  up and coming MMA fighter.
*  So he has all the weapons, takedowns, submissions,
*  kicks, all that jazz, but he's choosing to fight Floyd
*  in a boxing fight just for money,
*  just like Conor McGregor did.
*  It's really a trick.
*  He gets these people to box with him.
*  They have no business boxing with him.
*  And he's making millions and millions of dollars
*  doing this way after his competitive career is over.
*  Which is-
*  I guess he's earned that right.
*  Hey man, he's a genius.
*  He really is a genius.
*  He's a genius in figuring out a way to keep making money.
*  And one of the reasons why people watch him fight
*  is not because he's like Mike Tyson,
*  just goes out and destroys people.
*  They like watching him fight because they hate him.
*  Because he talks so much shit.
*  And he's like, look at my million dollar watch.
*  Look at my fucking jet.
*  Look at my house, look at this.
*  He's like constantly showing you all these things
*  that he has.
*  Like he'll lay out watches in a hotel bed.
*  Like this is a million dollars worth of watches.
*  This watch goes for $2 million.
*  And they're like, this is my small watch
*  that I take sometimes, but I want to show you.
*  When I show up, I bring out the big boy
*  and it brings out this watch that's covered in diamonds.
*  It's like fucking $5 million.
*  And so you hate him.
*  People hate him.
*  He creates envy.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, he creates envy and you want him to lose,
*  but he's not gonna, he's so good.
*  But the other thing is discipline, right?
*  He's not just this cocky guy
*  who's like really good at boxing.
*  He also has incredible discipline.
*  I've seen clips of him running in the middle of the night.
*  He would go to a nightclub with everybody else,
*  be drinking water.
*  Everybody's partying, having a good time.
*  Floyd would leave the nightclub at 2 a.m.,
*  have his bodyguards drive the car,
*  and he would run in front of the car for hours.
*  Run home, two o'clock in the morning.
*  Run five, six miles.
*  And did it all the time.
*  Just always did.
*  He was always fit, always in shape.
*  Never got fat, never got lazy.
*  Always was ready.
*  And so never really experienced decline.
*  And then decided at a certain point in time,
*  after the Conor McGregor fight, okay, I'm done.
*  Done.
*  Did it all.
*  Beat everybody.
*  Undefeated.
*  Bye.
*  And now he just has these demonstration fights
*  where they're weird little exhibitions
*  where he's just beating people up
*  that have no business in the ring with them.
*  And one of them, he was walking around
*  with a fucking a card, a ring card.
*  He took it from the ring card girl
*  and he started dancing around.
*  So he's like under no threat whatsoever.
*  He's enjoying life.
*  Well, people like to be angry.
*  I'm always calling to mind a study.
*  I'll keep this really brief,
*  but there's a famous study by a guy named Robert Heath,
*  who was a neurosurgeon,
*  and he put a bunch of stimulating electrodes
*  into the brain of some humans getting neurosurgery.
*  And he offered them the opportunity
*  to stimulate any area they wanted.
*  And he stimulates some areas and they'd feel happy
*  or giddy or drunk or sexual arousal or whatever.
*  You know, the one area that all,
*  there were only three subjects,
*  but for human neurosurgery,
*  that's not a terrible subject number.
*  The area that all three of them preferred vastly
*  over the other areas to be stimulated
*  evoked the sense of anger and frustration.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, people like to be angry.
*  Which is why Twitter is so popular.
*  Yeah.
*  And to some extent Instagram and I don't know.
*  Sure, but Twitter is the one the most
*  because it's mostly just talking or mostly just text.
*  Instagram is photographs.
*  And so you could just,
*  I don't comment on people's photos very, very rarely.
*  I might've commented on photos 12 times in my life.
*  You know, just a friend, like that's awesome, way to go.
*  Something nice.
*  But I don't even read comments.
*  But I look at pictures.
*  I go, oh, that's cool.
*  Oh, look at that video, that's fucking crazy.
*  I'll give it a little tap, double tap,
*  give you a little heart, give you a little love,
*  and then move on about my day.
*  But in Twitter, I'm constantly just engaging
*  with people's thoughts and arguments and debates.
*  And that's why I think Twitter's the most addictive
*  of all the social media platforms.
*  In terms of engagement, but not as addictive as TikTok
*  in terms of it compels you to continue to watch.
*  I wanna keep going with this, but I have to pee so bad.
*  I did the sauna before we got here
*  and I drank 64 liters of water.
*  Or 64 ounces rather.
*  All right, we'll be right back.
*  We were at people like to get angry.
*  And you were saying that you had another urge
*  to take another sniff for these smelling salts.
*  So I'm observing something interesting
*  about the smelling salts.
*  It's definitely like, brrack, hits hard.
*  And then you feel really good afterwards.
*  You can feel it in your body.
*  You can feel it in my body.
*  And then I noticed there's kind of a hunger for it.
*  Right, like another hit.
*  Yeah, like maybe in 20 minutes or so.
*  Just like a cocaine thing, allegedly.
*  I've never tried cocaine.
*  Me neither, good for you.
*  But that's what I hear.
*  Yeah, I wonder, I doubt that hits the dopamine circuit.
*  But, a little valuable science tidbit,
*  we hear so much about dopamine, adrenaline.
*  Look, there are three molecules.
*  They're called the catecholamines.
*  Dopamine, epinephrine, adrenaline,
*  and norepinephrine, noradrenaline.
*  And they are actually,
*  some are biochemical derivatives of others,
*  and they are cousins.
*  They work like a little clan of molecules
*  to raise alertness and focus and drive.
*  I think the great Robert Sapolsky said it best.
*  He said, dopamine is not about the pursuit of pleasure.
*  It's about the pleasure of pursuit.
*  That makes sense.
*  That's why he's Robert Sapolsky.
*  Talk about the journey.
*  That's right.
*  So you combine motivation with adrenaline,
*  which gets your body in a position to move better,
*  and noradrenaline, which kind of works in between those two.
*  It's a little more complicated and not worth going into.
*  But they work as kind of like a gang of three
*  to raise alertness, directional motivation, and go.
*  And so I wouldn't be surprised
*  if there was a little bit of a dopaminergic aspect
*  to those smelling salts.
*  I'd have to look it up and see.
*  But I certainly like it.
*  It feels good.
*  It feels good.
*  That sounds weird.
*  And that's why I've never tried cocaine or amphetamine.
*  Like I like upstates, as they call them.
*  Me too, same thing.
*  I've never tried Adderall either, but I've been tempted.
*  People tell me about them, like, Jesus.
*  I've never tried it.
*  You get organized.
*  I'm trying to think of it.
*  There was a chart out on Twitter,
*  we were just talking about Twitter,
*  where all the different nootropics,
*  or let's not call them smart drugs,
*  but things that can enhance alertness,
*  things like alpha GPC.
*  As you know, 600 milligrams alpha GPC.
*  I don't care who it is.
*  That's like, where's the double blind
*  placebo controlled study that shows it
*  raises alertness and focus?
*  Look, as much as I believe in science,
*  you don't need a double blind placebo controlled study
*  to know the swift kick in the shin hurts,
*  and that 600 milligrams of alpha GPC
*  is going to make you more alert.
*  Is it safe?
*  Well, we did double blind placebo controlled studies
*  for alpha brain.
*  Right, right.
*  And so they exist.
*  And certainly that's one that I would put
*  kind of high on the tier of things for,
*  if you want alertness and focus,
*  it's certainly more benign than a lot of prescription drugs
*  that create alertness.
*  But theanine is also really effective for that too.
*  And I don't know how many studies there are on that.
*  Not as many.
*  Theanine takes away the jitters,
*  like 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine
*  will take away the jitters associated with stimulants,
*  which is why it's now in a lot of energy drinks.
*  So you'll see alpha GPC, theanine, sometimes L-tyrosine,
*  which is a precursor to dopamine.
*  But there were a couple of things on that list,
*  including prescription drugs,
*  like modafinil, for instance,
*  which was originally designed
*  for the treatment of narcolepsy.
*  Was it designed for that,
*  or was it designed as a performance enhancing drug,
*  but they needed a way to prescribe it?
*  Both.
*  Yeah.
*  So for the treatment of narcolepsy,
*  it also has been shown to improve alertness
*  and cognitive function in sleep deprived individuals.
*  So you can imagine military finding that very useful.
*  That's new vigil and pro-vigil, right?
*  Correct.
*  I took that stuff for a while.
*  I was taking it.
*  And you know what I would really like to take it?
*  Say if I had a gig in San Diego,
*  and I was done with my gig at 11 o'clock,
*  I was like, I wanna go home.
*  I don't wanna stay in a hotel.
*  Fuck it, let me drive home.
*  And if I would drive home,
*  there'd be that risk of the sleep coming on
*  because there's a weird thing about being on the highway.
*  About those lines, they fucking hypnotize you.
*  It's really weird.
*  Oh yeah, and the...
*  Yeah, and so for anybody out here, listen to this,
*  because my manager told me this, it's really important.
*  If you think you're gonna fall asleep,
*  there's a great way to mitigate it that's pain-free.
*  Get a rag, like a washcloth, and some ice and some water,
*  and have like a little thing next to you
*  with a cold, wet rag, and just wipe that rag on your face.
*  And then you're good for like five more minutes.
*  Reach in there and start, oh man, I'm just gonna sleep again.
*  Wipe that rag on your face, you wake right up.
*  This is a great one. Pain-free.
*  This is a great one, and it fits right in
*  with what Matt Walker says to do the opposite to fall asleep,
*  where you wash your face with warm water,
*  take a hot shower.
*  I go in the sauna.
*  We're going in the sauna, everyone says,
*  well, you're heating up your body.
*  You need to cool down to fall asleep,
*  but you heat up the surface of your body,
*  and the medial preoptic area of your hypothalamus,
*  which is your brain's thermostat, says,
*  hey, the surface of the body is heating up.
*  What should I do?
*  Cool down my core temperature, and that puts you to sleep.
*  Would it be bad to do sauna and then cold plunge,
*  and then try to go to sleep?
*  I do that if I'm late in the day and I'm tired.
*  It's not a problem, but I end with kind of a warmish shower.
*  If I want to be alert, I end on cold.
*  If I want to go to sleep, I end with warm.
*  Which is why I start the day with cold, to wake up.
*  And when you get in the cold,
*  the surface of the body gets cold.
*  That's kind of a no-brainer.
*  And the core body temperature goes up
*  because the medial preoptic area,
*  your brain's thermostat says,
*  wait, the surface of the body is cooling down.
*  I'm going to heat up.
*  And waking up in the morning is largely the consequence
*  of body temperature going up.
*  So why do you wake up more quickly in the cold?
*  Well, body temperature goes up more quickly.
*  Also, big shot of adrenaline from cold water.
*  Nobody escapes the adrenaline from cold water,
*  at least upon getting in, as long as it's cold enough.
*  And last time you picked on me
*  about how warm I'm keeping my ice bath,
*  can't even be called an ice bath.
*  So my cold plunge is now set at mid-40s.
*  That's better.
*  Getting better.
*  But I still go into the sauna at 210, 220.
*  By the way, I don't know if I'm right.
*  I'm probably wrong.
*  My wife doesn't want, she wants to get a second cold plunge
*  because she doesn't like how cold mine is
*  because mine has ice in it.
*  Yeah, you're probably in the 30s.
*  Yeah, it's 34.
*  It's fucking cold as shit.
*  It's beast mode kind of.
*  I've got a new one that I got from Morosco.
*  We have two.
*  So we have one here at the gym that's a blue cube.
*  This one's insane because you can crank it
*  and you turn up the knob
*  and it'll be like a flowing raging river.
*  Well, and the flow breaks up the thermal layer
*  on the outside of your body.
*  When you're sitting in the cold plunge,
*  I always say those stoic things
*  where people are in the cold plunge, real still,
*  looking tough.
*  Tell that person to sift their arms around,
*  let that cold water get in your armpits.
*  Well, what's happening is you're breaking up
*  the thermal layer that keeps you a little bit warmer.
*  This is why we huddle in there
*  because it's not like you're making yourself,
*  it's not like you're wearing a jacket.
*  If you move or if the water is moving,
*  much more effective.
*  It's painful for me to just check my watch
*  to see how much time I got left.
*  It sucks.
*  Yeah, I have a system now.
*  If I count slowly to 10 two times,
*  so I count to 20 and I know exactly how long my breath is
*  for it to be three minutes.
*  I know how to do it.
*  So I do it now.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's a little cheating.
*  You know what I do?
*  Man, I can't believe I'm gonna admit this publicly.
*  You know what I do?
*  I got two little rubber duckies in there.
*  One's a tougher looking rubber ducky
*  and his name is Rogan.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  I shot a video of this.
*  I'll send it to you.
*  My producer's gonna kill me.
*  And then there's another one and that's Huberman
*  and it's you basically teasing me about what a wuss I am.
*  And I do that for the entire time I'm in the cold plunge.
*  So I forget that I'm in the cold plunge.
*  And then at the end you go, okay, you can get out now.
*  And I'm like, okay.
*  Well, here's what it is.
*  I don't know if the cold is any,
*  if it's any better to be 34 degrees
*  or if it's any better to be 45 degrees or 50 degrees.
*  But what I do know is that I don't like 34 degrees.
*  So that's why I do it.
*  Because if I feel like I can get away
*  with making it a little bit easier, I feel like a bitch.
*  So that's why I do it as cold as it can get
*  before it freezes solid,
*  which seems to be 34 degrees.
*  Well, this gets to something that I know we've talked
*  a little bit about before offline, not on microphone,
*  which is doing hard things translates to an ability
*  to do hard things and probably translates,
*  provided it doesn't kill you, to a longer life.
*  And you've explained that there's actually a part
*  of your brain that grows.
*  So there's a brain area that most neuroscientists
*  aren't aware of called the anterior mid cingulate cortex.
*  Scientists who are in the know, know about it.
*  I teach neuroanatomy and medical students at Stanford.
*  It's an area that we cover in passing,
*  but there are a lot of brain areas.
*  Can't get to everything.
*  But in the last couple of years,
*  there've been studies of this area,
*  the anterior mid cingulate cortex,
*  that make it super important for everybody to know about,
*  not just neuroscientists.
*  And here's the deal.
*  A colleague of mine at Stanford, Joe Parvizzi,
*  he's a neurosurgeon.
*  He's in there stimulating different brain areas,
*  including anterior mid cingulate cortex and areas near it,
*  in human patients while they're awake,
*  preparing them for neurosurgery for other reasons.
*  Stimulates anterior mid cingulate cortex.
*  And what do all people who have
*  their anterior mid cingulate cortex report?
*  They feel like there's something about to happen.
*  Something's kind of looming, a challenge, a storm.
*  Some will report it as a storm or a physical challenge,
*  but their overall sensation is one
*  that they want to lean into it.
*  They want to challenge it.
*  Now, this area's subsequently been imaged
*  in people who are successful dieters, it grows larger.
*  In people that fail at a dieting or nutrition program,
*  it gets smaller.
*  People that embrace a new form of exercise,
*  and here's the key point that they don't want to do,
*  this area gets bigger.
*  People that are just doing things that they enjoy doing
*  does not change in shape or size.
*  Now, here's where it gets even more interesting.
*  The anterior mid cingulate cortex is larger in volume
*  in a group of people called superagers, okay?
*  That's a bit of a misnomer because it implies
*  they age faster, they actually age more slowly
*  as it relates to cognitive decline.
*  The slope of cognitive decline is not as steep
*  in these people, meaning they're holding on
*  to cognitive abilities longer than other people
*  into older age.
*  And the universal quality among these superagers
*  is not just a larger anterior mid cingulate cortex,
*  but that they challenge themselves to do things
*  that are challenging and they kind of don't want to do
*  or really don't want to do.
*  So when we hear, oh, you know, people should do
*  crossword puzzles to maintain their memory,
*  probably good to keep some cognitive flexibility going.
*  But if you love crossword puzzles,
*  you're not going to grow your anterior mid cingulate cortex.
*  If you love 45 degrees in the cold plunge
*  after an hour long run in the hills, which I do,
*  probably not going to do much to grow this area.
*  If you really don't want to do something and you do it,
*  this area gets bigger.
*  And it's got inputs and outputs from all of these
*  different brain areas that make all of this make sense.
*  Like the dopamine system, like the learning and memory
*  system, like the areas of the brain that say,
*  no, I'm going to retreat from that, it's aversive.
*  But you push yourself to do something
*  that you don't want to do, this area gets bigger.
*  And the best part is it translates to an ability
*  to do harder things elsewhere.
*  This to me, I get obviously super excited about
*  because it's nested in human data and animal data
*  in real world examples of dieting and exercise
*  and aging and longevity and all of that.
*  And it speaks to much of what you've talked about
*  on this podcast for years and years, which is do hard things.
*  It will give you an ability to do other hard things.
*  But if you love doing dead lifts, honestly,
*  even sets to failure on those dead lifts, enjoy them,
*  benefit from them, all the wonderful things
*  that come with doing dead lifts, great.
*  But you should probably also do something
*  that you don't enjoy doing if you have an interest
*  in the kind of benefits that we're talking about.
*  Well, it completely makes sense that your brain
*  would have to develop an ability to continue
*  to do difficult things.
*  And that ability to not hesitate and push through,
*  the ability to not procrastinate and go forward.
*  And that that thing is probably like all things,
*  it's like cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance,
*  like you develop an ability to do more of it
*  because of that.
*  Because your brain recognizes this is something
*  that we're going to have to deal with,
*  let's figure out how to respond to this.
*  Right, and movement itself, like physical movement
*  or cognitive movement, if you're learning new things
*  like comedy, preparing new things or learning poetry
*  or drawing, like I used to draw a lot,
*  I've started drawing again,
*  carrying around this notebook everywhere.
*  I'm not going to show the drawings, they're just for me.
*  But pushing myself to do something that I enjoy,
*  but that like there's a barrier there.
*  Are you any good?
*  I mean, I do anatomical drawings.
*  Let me see what you got, I got a lot of dicks in there.
*  No.
*  It's like super bad.
*  Actually, I think here is-
*  Remember super bad?
*  This is one of my favorite scenes in a movie ever.
*  This is my journal book notes.
*  But I've actually, I used to post my drawings on Instagram,
*  that's how I started.
*  Really?
*  In 2019, I wasn't thinking about having a podcast,
*  I was just posting pictures of the retina.
*  Talking about the retina.
*  When did we meet?
*  So 2019, I started posting on Instagram,
*  2020, I came on this podcast for the first time.
*  Okay.
*  But you were in LA at that time.
*  Right, right.
*  And yeah, and then I went on Lex's podcast
*  a little bit later, and then he goes,
*  you should start a podcast.
*  So I started January 21.
*  Yeah, okay, so here's some of your-
*  They're not great, they're just for fun.
*  They're just for fun.
*  They're just for fun.
*  Not bad at all.
*  I like to use them to teach.
*  So they're not, listen, I'm no DaVinci, but-
*  That's pretty good, actually.
*  But the point, I'm obsessed with this thing
*  that somewhere between perfect accuracy
*  and total representation of biology,
*  like a brain or a set of cells,
*  and at the other end of the continuum, like ball and stick,
*  there's like a perfect sweet spot for teaching.
*  And so what I'm doing there is what I do in the classroom.
*  I go, okay, listen, we're gonna talk about
*  how muscle releases a microRNA that helps you burn fat.
*  And then I kind of remind people, like, there's fat.
*  So I don't want too much detail,
*  but I don't want too little detail either.
*  Dude, that's good.
*  Like the anatomy of the hand is dead on.
*  That's really good.
*  So I'm trying, I'm trying.
*  No, that's really good.
*  And of course, that's not anatomically correct.
*  Like the nerves don't spit out of the tip of the finger.
*  But when you're trying to teach-
*  Dude, that's good eye.
*  Yeah, that's really good.
*  Yeah, like I'm just trying, again,
*  I'm not trying to be DaVinci.
*  I just want people to learn the information.
*  So- One of my daughters is insanely good.
*  Oh yeah. Yeah.
*  Well, I wanted to be a comic book illustrator
*  when I was young.
*  And I always wonder like how much of talent
*  gets passed on to kids.
*  It's hard to separate nature and nurture there.
*  But honestly, I think there's something there.
*  There's something there.
*  There's something.
*  Because there's certain people that like,
*  if their parent was a singer, like, but then you go,
*  well, maybe they were singing around the house a lot
*  when they were growing up.
*  People are gonna think I'm weird for saying this,
*  but I don't care.
*  I am weird.
*  I'm gonna say it anyway.
*  Scholl's, the way he moves, like how lithe he is.
*  And his parents are like dancers and performers, right?
*  Right. Right.
*  Also, he's a good boxer.
*  Is he really? Yeah.
*  Like just his movements are so atypical.
*  And like he's like, it's like watching him is cool.
*  Like he looks cool the way he moves.
*  He's free. Yeah.
*  And there's a skateboarder named Jimmy Wilkins,
*  who's like breaking every barrier on skateboarding.
*  And he actually uses his knees to contact the board
*  and move the board while his hands are free.
*  And he's a smaller guy, real small, real lithe,
*  super loose ankles.
*  And I said to him, like, what do your parents do?
*  And he goes, my mom's a ballerina
*  and my dad's an orchestra conductor.
*  This guy's using his knees on the board.
*  So like he does everything, not everything,
*  but he does a lot of things hands-free at mock speed.
*  For people in skateboarding,
*  they probably just want to see flips and 900 varials.
*  And that stuff's cool.
*  But he makes everything look so good.
*  I mean, Jimmy, for those that are in the know,
*  Jimmy Wilkins is like the next,
*  like Tony will say, Tony Hawk,
*  everyone will say like watching Jimmy.
*  Look, see the whole thing here is that Jimmy's skateboarding
*  is like perfect poetry.
*  Like, so the reason,
*  so his back knee is often used to stabilize the board
*  because he's got that hip looseness
*  that you were talking about earlier.
*  And so his, yeah, he's doing great.
*  He won X Games last year, not this year.
*  This year he took third.
*  So those guys get banged up though.
*  Those guys get a lot of concussions.
*  Yeah, he's big on the nicotine.
*  I'm trying to get him to quit the nicotine.
*  So he, cause he loves the nicotine, but between-
*  Why are you getting him to quit?
*  Like, I don't have a problem with people taking nicotine.
*  Pouches?
*  But it is, it's a vasoconstrictor, raises blood pressure.
*  As long as you're healthy in other ways.
*  I just think that I see people go from like one pouch
*  to a canister a day.
*  Oh yeah.
*  It's just-
*  They ramp up the dosage too.
*  I like threes, like mild, three milligrams.
*  But Lucy sent me some that are twelves.
*  Jesus, Louisa's.
*  I can do like half a piece of Nicorette.
*  I put that, the 12 in my mouth for like 30 seconds
*  and my body's like, get it out of here.
*  That's a lot.
*  It seems like you're good at keeping things
*  in that useful, but not excessive domain.
*  Yes.
*  Well, I'm a control freak in that way.
*  I know I want to be in control.
*  I don't ever want to be out of control.
*  Like I've never been addicted to a sub,
*  other than coffee, I guess.
*  But I've taken time off of coffee too,
*  just cause I know that I like it too much.
*  But coffee doesn't overwhelm me, right?
*  So if I felt like coffee was overwhelming me,
*  or if it was difficult to acquire or illegal,
*  I probably would quit coffee.
*  A chuckle, but at the rate the world's going,
*  it's probably going to be illegal.
*  Well, it's always good.
*  The reason why coffee is legal
*  and is the reason why they created meth really,
*  because it's good for productivity.
*  Like coffee keeps you from getting tired.
*  It's good for productivity.
*  It's also enjoyable.
*  People like a nice warm liquid.
*  I love, and since I really got into coffee
*  from doing this podcast, really, I drink it black.
*  I like coffee.
*  I like the taste.
*  I look forward to it.
*  I have one every morning.
*  I look, I like it.
*  But if it-
*  I love it in the afternoon.
*  But if I thought it was fucking with my life,
*  100% I would quit.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, I've had times in my life
*  where I was drinking too much,
*  mostly cause of comedy, cause nights,
*  you're out with your boys and everybody wants to drink.
*  They're all drinking.
*  My friends are all drunks.
*  Like, like a good solid percentage.
*  Whitney doesn't drink.
*  No, Whitney does not drink,
*  but a good solid percentage of my friends drink a lot.
*  They drink all the time.
*  They drink at clubs.
*  Like Shane Gillis.
*  I tried to get Bert to quit.
*  Bert is not going to quit.
*  Well, he asked me to help him quit.
*  He doesn't mean that.
*  Otherwise I wouldn't.
*  He just wants you to talk to him.
*  Just talk about Bert.
*  I'll talk about him.
*  That's what he wants, but that's what he wants.
*  Let's talk about me.
*  Let's talk about me.
*  I see.
*  About how I have to quit.
*  Come on, talk to me about me.
*  Let's make it all about Bert.
*  That's what Bert likes.
*  Well, he was doing better with his health.
*  And then he posted that photo of himself in the wetsuit.
*  Come on, Bert.
*  Like get with it.
*  Did he get fat again?
*  He sent me a picture the other day.
*  He was all skinny.
*  Is he lying?
*  No, he's looking more like a melted candle.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  He got big at least to get jacked.
*  He started lifting weights.
*  I feel bad making fun of him,
*  but I'm not making fun of him.
*  I'm just worried.
*  As long as you're talking about him.
*  I'm just worried about his health.
*  Oh yeah, that's not good, Bert.
*  I'm worried about your health.
*  Well, the thing is Bert is on tour, right?
*  He's got painted toenails too.
*  What the fuck are you doing?
*  He's on tour.
*  So he's on this fully loaded tour.
*  He's doing all these arenas with all these friends.
*  And they're doing activities constantly.
*  They go to water parks.
*  I don't know if they go to water parks.
*  Shit like that.
*  Can you bring a kettlebell or something?
*  They do that too.
*  But he gets drunk every night.
*  And it's not just like a little bit of beer.
*  It's a lot of beer.
*  It's a lot of, they have a vodka company now.
*  That's not good.
*  Now they have their own vodka.
*  So he's drinking his own.
*  Everybody loves a young drunk,
*  but as time goes on, it does not look pretty.
*  Yes, but there's a curve when it comes back around again.
*  You see a 90 year old guy that's hammered.
*  That guy's fun.
*  Like then they're wild again.
*  A 90 year old guy with like a fucking straw hat on
*  and a gun.
*  He's drunk.
*  I must say.
*  Like Hannah Rice Thompson when he was before he died.
*  Oh man.
*  I must say I thoroughly enjoyed your live comedy.
*  Oh, thank you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  Watch it three times.
*  So that one was another example
*  of doing something I didn't want to do.
*  Cause they offered me to do it live.
*  And I was like, fuck that.
*  Like I want to be able to edit mistakes out.
*  I want to have, you know,
*  have four shows and pick the best one and do that.
*  I don't want to do it fucking live.
*  That's who fucking needs that pressure.
*  It was so good.
*  I watched the first one with my girlfriend.
*  We watched it as it was happening.
*  Then I watched it with my friend Tim out when he was out.
*  He's out on tour.
*  Like Green Day Rance,
*  all these 90s bands smashing pumpkins are out on tour.
*  Like stadiums with 90,000 people.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  I went out cause I'm like, you know, big rancid fan.
*  And I like the other guys too,
*  but I'm a big, big rancid fan.
*  I was like, holy cow.
*  Like people love this stuff again.
*  Anyway, we watched it again there.
*  And then I've watched it again.
*  I will say it felt very cathartic to me.
*  I don't know how it felt for you,
*  but it felt really cathartic.
*  Oh, the subject matter?
*  The subject matter.
*  And also like the next day was pure,
*  like delight and just baffled and shocked all
*  at the same time when on Twitter,
*  I see a clip taken completely out of context
*  about a bit about taking things out of context.
*  It's like life had like looped back on itself.
*  You were talking about things being taken out of context
*  and they were taking it out of context.
*  They had like cut it.
*  And I was like, wait, wait, wait.
*  I remember that very differently.
*  Cause I remember things that I hear pretty well.
*  And I was like, went back and I was like,
*  wait, he's talking about things being taken out of context
*  and they're taking it out of context.
*  Yeah, they don't care.
*  But there's always some people that are just,
*  this is not in good faith.
*  Everything they're doing is just trying to find something
*  wrong with everything you're doing.
*  And it's usually people that their life is a mess.
*  There's no one who does that,
*  who is a healthy accomplished person
*  who has great relationships in their life
*  and is doing really well at some skill or chosen profession
*  that they enjoy very much.
*  They're not fulfilled.
*  Or people are trying to politicize something.
*  Yeah.
*  Or they're trying to get clicks off your name.
*  There's a lot of that for sure.
*  So there's a business in that.
*  And then there's also people that are doing,
*  like MSNBC did this recently.
*  And there's, this has gotten so popular
*  that my fucking stepdad contacted me
*  to tell me he's happy that I'm suing MSNBC.
*  I'm like, I'm not suing MSNBC.
*  But this is what MSNBC did.
*  They took a clip of me talking about Tulsi Gabbard
*  and they edited it up and made it look like
*  I was saying great things about Kamala Harris.
*  Wait, what?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you and I have been mashed up on other stuff
*  and AI and I don't want to, like you said,
*  we don't want to draw attention
*  that they got taken off the internet, thank goodness.
*  But it was bullshit.
*  It was like, it was AI and mashup.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of AI ads with us.
*  They did that about politics.
*  Yes, they did it about politics,
*  but they didn't do it like AI.
*  They just deceptively edited the things that I was saying,
*  took it completely out of context
*  where I was talking about,
*  first of all, I was talking about Tulsi Gabbard.
*  And then I was talking about that the media
*  behind Kamala Harris, all this surge
*  and all these people deciding that she's good, she could win.
*  And they put the two of those together
*  and made it seem like I was praising Kamala Harris
*  and saying a bunch of things that aren't even true about her.
*  Like I was talking about Tulsi Gabbard
*  being a congresswoman for eight years
*  and about how she served overseas.
*  Two deployments in medical units
*  dealing with people who were blown up from the war.
*  That's not something Kamala Harris did.
*  It's something Tulsi Gabbard did.
*  I was just saying things about her
*  and they put it out there as a clip of me
*  praising Kamala Harris.
*  But they don't care about the truth.
*  They just want a narrative to get out there
*  amongst enough people.
*  Because most people are just surface readers.
*  They read a headline, and I'd be guilty of that many times.
*  You read a headline, oh, I know what that is.
*  And then you shut your laptop.
*  I got it now.
*  I got the whole...
*  So if you read an article that says,
*  Andrew Schultz is a liar.
*  Oh, he's a liar.
*  I heard he's a liar.
*  And then you just start repeating he's a liar.
*  It doesn't have to be real.
*  And so all they have to do with...
*  How many people are actually gonna watch my Netflix special?
*  Well, it's a lot,
*  but compared to the amount of people in the country,
*  not a lot.
*  Small percentage.
*  So all you have to do is take something out of context
*  from someone who's never gonna watch it in the first place,
*  put it in front of them.
*  Oh, that piece of shit.
*  I can't believe he said that,
*  even though I'm literally talking about things
*  being taken out of context.
*  The part about this is so frustrating to me
*  is that at some point, especially as a scientist,
*  that's data selection.
*  But if you look at data
*  and you look at scientific experimentation,
*  it starts with a question.
*  You generate a hypothesis.
*  You collect data.
*  You publish the results,
*  and you get to state your conclusions.
*  Now let's talk about what you're talking about.
*  In the world of science,
*  I don't think there's a lot of outright data fraud,
*  but a lot of experiments that don't work,
*  people come up with excuses to eliminate those data.
*  But there is some data fraud, right?
*  Oh, there certainly is some data fraud.
*  The amyloid plaques thing with Alzheimer's.
*  There's certainly some data fraud,
*  and there's a range of underlying reasons.
*  One of the more common reasons that people don't talk about,
*  which is something to really strongly inoculate
*  in laboratories against,
*  is when a laboratory is known for doing very, very good work,
*  oftentimes the graduate students and postdocs
*  that go there feel like they need
*  to give the boss the result.
*  So sometimes it's unbeknownst to the person running the lab.
*  There've been a lot of cases in recent years
*  of papers being discovered as having major issues,
*  and that's like, well, do you go after the lab head,
*  or do you go after the person who did it?
*  Lab heads are responsible for everything in their lab.
*  AI is helping with this,
*  because you can scan data and look at things.
*  But ambition is a dangerous thing
*  if somebody puts ambition ahead of accuracy.
*  Sure. Okay.
*  So there's that kind of thing.
*  And then there's outright data fraud.
*  I mean, there was this nanotechnologist guy
*  from some years back,
*  I think his last name was Shone,
*  who had like 20 papers in Science and Nature in two years.
*  And it turns out he wasn't even bothering to,
*  he was fabricating data.
*  The papers were all retracted.
*  And I don't know what he's doing now,
*  but the noise plots,
*  the random noise plots in these papers
*  were the way he got caught.
*  What it turned out is that,
*  I mean, I'm juggling because it's like,
*  he was so lazy, ambitious, but so lazy,
*  that he didn't even bother to use new random noise plots
*  from one paper to the next.
*  So somebody said, wait, random, random should be random.
*  Why is it the same in these two papers?
*  Boom. And then the whole thing unraveled.
*  Eventually. Wow, so lazy.
*  So he was particularly ambitious, lazy,
*  and that was outright fraud.
*  There are all sorts of other cases and things like that.
*  And there's people who make their sport to talk about.
*  Most scientists are trying to get the correct answers.
*  I do believe that.
*  Most scientists have good faith.
*  They're trying to get the answer,
*  but it's hard, science is hard.
*  Now, what you're talking about,
*  to me sounds like people deliberately grabbing
*  from the palette of paints,
*  that is the words that are spoken
*  by anybody on the internet,
*  especially people with podcasts,
*  you or me or anybody else,
*  and then literally cutting and pasting things together
*  to create a story, which is fiction.
*  Do you know who Pink Trip is?
*  No. You don't know Pink Trip?
*  Pink Trip is hilarious.
*  He's a guy on the internet who takes clips of podcasts
*  and creates narratives of things
*  that are totally not happening.
*  Oh yeah, I've seen some of you-
*  There's one recently, me and Tucker Carlson
*  are having an argument.
*  I haven't seen that one.
*  It's good.
*  Somebody sent it to me.
*  Who fucking sent it?
*  Let's see if we can find it.
*  I remember one of you and Elon, several perhaps.
*  Yeah, so I know that-
*  So Pink Trip is-
*  Is it called Pink Trips?
*  No, it's a dude.
*  Oh, okay.
*  His name is Pink, so here it is, Pink Trip.
*  So it's visible.
*  What? No.
*  Space is real.
*  Are you joking?
*  You're a science denier.
*  What?
*  Stop.
*  The bodies of science have bestowed the truth.
*  If you ignore it-
*  If I get another fucking lecture from you,
*  I'm gonna go crazy.
*  When did you start having this opinion?
*  Shut the fuck up, bitch.
*  You're a fucking idiot.
*  Don't do that anymore.
*  What are you gonna do about it, bitch?
*  What are you gonna do about it?
*  You are literally powerless.
*  I'm just gonna do whatever I want.
*  You could get your ass kicked.
*  Are you threatening me?
*  Yeah.
*  I think you are a far right, white supremacist, racist.
*  You're like my dog.
*  Does it ever occur to you that you're disgusting?
*  Just like vulgar, just like a pig.
*  If I were to sort of narrow down my bigotries,
*  it's like people like you,
*  I just think you're disgusting.
*  So these are actual spoken words, clued together.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  About completely different things.
*  It's really masterful.
*  Do you wanna die?
*  Watch.
*  If I take a nine millimeter rounder,
*  seven six two by 39 and shoot you,
*  can you catch the bullet?
*  You can't do that.
*  What are you gonna do about it?
*  I got a bigger one.
*  Why would you hide that?
*  That's just wrong.
*  That's not fair.
*  Isn't that funny?
*  But this is funny, right?
*  He does that with a lot of stuff,
*  like people pretending to be in love with him.
*  He makes it like there's a romance between me
*  and different people.
*  But that's funny.
*  That's art, right?
*  He's making a story that doesn't exist.
*  It's really funny, right?
*  But there's people that do it just to either,
*  in this case, it was to promote Kamala Harris
*  to get the passive listener,
*  the people that are the casual to go,
*  oh wow, Joe Rogan likes Kamala Harris.
*  I heard you're endorsing
*  and not endorsing all sorts of people.
*  Yeah, I can't even say I like somebody
*  without it being an endorsement and people getting mad.
*  But I think the MAGA people are happy now
*  that Robert F. Kennedy is now with Trump.
*  They've unified the belts.
*  Yeah, I think we're in a very weird time with the media.
*  And I think truth is super important.
*  And I think someone that's willing
*  to do something like that,
*  that's a real offense.
*  It's a real offense.
*  It's not a small thing.
*  It's a real lie.
*  And it's a lie that changes other people's opinion.
*  You take what's perceived to be an influential person
*  and you distort their views in either a way to shame them,
*  make them look bad or to promote someone else.
*  That's a real lie.
*  That's a dangerous lie.
*  It's a real offense.
*  And I think that there's no laws against that right now,
*  except libel law.
*  I mean, you could take someone to court, I guess.
*  But it's a real gross lie.
*  And it's used right now to manipulate public opinion.
*  Yeah, completely out of context in the example you gave.
*  And certainly I'm familiar with examples
*  where context is completely cut off
*  at the point where it leads to a false conclusion.
*  Oh, sure.
*  Like where the story is completely different.
*  The reason I gave the counter example of science
*  when you're trained as a scientist,
*  you're trained to try and parse what's real
*  and what's not real and give the best version of that
*  that you can.
*  And then you are allowed to state your conclusions.
*  But I have a question.
*  At what point do you think the general public
*  will come to understand that this is the way
*  that a lot of things that they see out there
*  are constructed to some degree or another
*  and stop actually believing it?
*  It depends on who the public is.
*  This is the issue right now with boomers, right?
*  Old liberals in particular,
*  all they do is watch the news and read the newspaper.
*  And whatever's printed, they believe.
*  And it's very difficult to get them to consider like,
*  hey, maybe someone's lying.
*  Maybe there's propaganda campaigns.
*  Maybe there's like this widespread media narrative
*  that they're pushing because corporations are behind it
*  and advertising is behind it.
*  And they're figuring out a way
*  to manipulate the public opinion on things.
*  It's very hard to get old boomers to believe that
*  because they're old, okay?
*  So they're set in their ways.
*  Their mind has formed around, you know, I am a liberal.
*  I am a Democrat.
*  I've been a Democrat my whole life.
*  This is how I feel about these issues.
*  This is my community.
*  This is my tribe.
*  These are my people.
*  And the news says this and I'm with them and oh, great.
*  We're up in the polls now.
*  And for them, it's like they're on a team.
*  They might as well be the dolphins versus the Raiders.
*  It's the same kind of mentality in their head.
*  And they don't want to be challenged.
*  That little part of their brain that exists
*  when you challenge yourself
*  and do things you don't want to do,
*  that bitch is shriveled up to almost nothing.
*  And they're real boring
*  and their lives are entirely excited by political discourse.
*  Do you think it's all boomers?
*  Yeah, it's mostly boomers.
*  I think young people are way less likely
*  to buy into bullshit now.
*  There's young people that are ideologically captured
*  for sure.
*  You see that both with right-wing people
*  and with left-wing people.
*  Sorry, I mean, do you think that all boomers believe
*  in the traditional media like this?
*  It's mostly because they grew up with it.
*  They're the ones.
*  The kids today, they don't buy it at all.
*  Like Gen Z kids and whatever the fuck they are.
*  What's the newest?
*  What's the latest?
*  Whatever these kids are.
*  These young kids coming up today,
*  like people in their 20s, they don't believe it at all.
*  Well, I'll tell you, you know,
*  I'll non-reluctantly tell you, you know, my dad and I,
*  over the years, like we had some early issues
*  and we resolved them and we're good now.
*  But when some not so kind press came out about me,
*  they interviewed a lot of people.
*  They interviewed a lot of people from my high school class
*  and friends and coworkers,
*  and then cherry picked for the story they wanted to create.
*  But they talked to my dad, okay?
*  And I would not put my dad into the political camp
*  that you described or any camp really.
*  But he's a first generation immigrant,
*  moved here from Argentina,
*  did his PhD under a scholarship from the Navy.
*  You know, it was like a story of an immigrant
*  who came here and became a scientist.
*  It was-
*  Yeah, there wasn't a lot of science to do in Argentina.
*  There's not a lot of funding for it, right?
*  So came here, I would say that when they reached out to him,
*  he was like, oh yeah, reporter was super nice.
*  You know, they asked me all these questions.
*  And then he called me.
*  He was like, I'm shocked.
*  I didn't say that.
*  That was completely flipped and twisted.
*  You know, and I said-
*  You gotta record those kinds of conversations.
*  And I said, it's okay.
*  You know, it's okay.
*  In fact, and that changed his perception.
*  I can't speak for him,
*  but based on conversations we've had since,
*  changed his perception.
*  He was like, I can't believe this,
*  that they would sort of leverage this for a false narrative.
*  You're allowed to do it for whatever reason.
*  You know, I have a friend who used to work at New York Times
*  and said they were encouraged to do it.
*  They were encouraged to just try to take someone down.
*  Like that was the whole idea of a piece.
*  Yeah, well, that was made clear by the fact
*  that many people reached out.
*  Like I had the best conversation with this person
*  or my former, when I was a kid, I grew up skateboarding
*  and I rode for this brand, you know, Thunder and Spitfire.
*  And my team manager was interviewed.
*  And then he called me afterwards and he said,
*  yeah, it was kind of weird.
*  Like I kept telling them the story that, you know,
*  that they had heard about you on podcasts over and over.
*  And they kept poking and probing, trying to get me.
*  And he said, that's what happened.
*  Andrew called me that day and said, help me.
*  I need to get out of this place, et cetera, et cetera.
*  And he was like, I don't get it.
*  And I was like, listen, Shruggie,
*  that's what we call them, Steve Ruggie.
*  I go, listen, like, thanks for talking to her,
*  but you know, it's just the way it works.
*  It's not about-
*  Like they weren't really interested in the truth.
*  They were interested in pulling out certain language.
*  An ex-girlfriend of mine said the same thing.
*  Like I talked to her and I told her like,
*  what a great relationship we had.
*  And then like what she printed kind of alluded
*  to something kind of slightly different.
*  And I just said, listen, you know, thanks for talking to me.
*  You know, like the goal is to collect a bunch of data.
*  Like this is where I compare it to science, my domain.
*  Take a bunch of data, cherry pick only the things
*  that could work if those only were true.
*  And some of them are just outright lies.
*  And then publish that, that is data fraud.
*  Like pharmaceutical studies.
*  Like many, like many.
*  And at the same time, you know,
*  like we're enjoying nicotine here or you are,
*  because I will say I'm not in defense
*  of the pharmaceutical industry, nor am I on attack of them.
*  But there are certain things that, you know,
*  push through traditional science.
*  You get great information about dosage and safety.
*  Look at Ozempic, right?
*  I get asked about this all the time.
*  I don't know how this became politicized.
*  I will say, if you do things to offset the muscle loss
*  for certain people, reducing their appetite with it
*  might be a useful tool.
*  It's expensive, is their dependence.
*  Those are important issues.
*  But we learned one thing for sure
*  from Ozempic, Monjaro, et cetera.
*  The main cause of the obesity crisis
*  is people eat too many calories.
*  On average about 3,500 calories per day
*  and they don't move enough.
*  They don't exercise enough.
*  And then we can get into what they eat, et cetera.
*  You know, we'd have a discussion about seed oils
*  if we really want to cause some friction.
*  I don't like seed oils.
*  I don't eat them,
*  but I'm not aware of any randomized control trial
*  that says that they're bad.
*  I just don't like them.
*  I like olive oil and butter,
*  and I like cooking beef and beef fat.
*  Tastes better and I feel better.
*  I feel better.
*  And that's enough of a reason for me.
*  But isn't there some science
*  about why they're bad for you?
*  So there's this whole thing about ratios of omega-3s
*  versus the omega-6s,
*  and you get a lot of omega-6s with the seed oils.
*  I think olive oil is good for us.
*  I think I will conclude that.
*  I think drinking less alcohol or no alcohol is good for you.
*  I think I'm of the belief
*  that high quality meat is good for you.
*  I'm also of the belief
*  that fruits and vegetables are good for you.
*  Like I think all the data point to these things.
*  I think that there isn't an abundance of data yet
*  that says seed oils are bad.
*  And I think Lane Norton would support that statement.
*  And he's kind of my go-to
*  in terms of what the randomized control trials say, right?
*  But in my experience,
*  I feel better when I'm not eating them.
*  So I choose personally not to eat them.
*  And frankly, there may be something to it, right?
*  I mean, now we're hearing all about microplastics.
*  We're hearing about all that.
*  But when it comes to the GLP-1 agonists, right?
*  I spent a lot of time on this, done two podcasts or more,
*  one with an expert, one solo, et cetera.
*  You know, of all the peptides that broke through,
*  you know, we've talked about peptides,
*  we've talked about more.
*  There's this one peptide, glucagon-like peptide one,
*  that when raised to levels about a thousand fold
*  over normal levels,
*  leads to massive suppression of appetite
*  and people lose weight.
*  Which for some people is an emergency situation.
*  They're really fat and there's nothing they can do
*  to lose the weight and they're getting sicker and sicker.
*  My hope would just be that those people
*  would also try and eat correctly and exercise.
*  And so the debate has become, is it good for you?
*  Is it bad?
*  Well, there's muscle loss.
*  So offset the muscle loss.
*  But let's be realistic.
*  Most people won't offset the muscle loss.
*  Right, if you could do both, it'd be better.
*  Yeah, or come off the ozepic bunjaro eventually
*  by replacing your behaviors.
*  It's hard to move when you're,
*  I've never been big and overweight,
*  but the way that Goggins talks about it,
*  it's gotta be uncomfortable.
*  When you're feeling kind of just not great,
*  just to move, you can get injured easily.
*  I would say one of the best ways to get
*  and stay in great shape your whole life is yes,
*  exercise, eat right, et cetera,
*  but also don't get badly hurt.
*  That's a huge one that nobody talks about.
*  And the number one way in my opinion to get badly hurt
*  is do a workout that a friend suggests
*  without at 10 out of 10.
*  Well, especially with heavy stuff.
*  Right, or go to one of these bootcamp things like,
*  I want to sweat a lot.
*  You go in, you do a bunch of circuit training for an hour
*  and two days later, your shoulders like, oh boy.
*  So you got to build up to that kind of stuff.
*  So, I think there are a lot of themes here,
*  but I'm not opposed to certain pharmaceuticals.
*  I think certain people need drugs for ADHD, a lot don't.
*  And dose response curves and lethal dose analysis
*  and that kind of stuff is super valuable.
*  What I don't like, because I don't think it's necessary
*  is when people default to the most expensive side effect,
*  risky kind of reflexive option,
*  because I think that the basics, sunlight, exercise,
*  cardio and weight training.
*  I mean, we're in a, like these things work.
*  They work so well.
*  They've always worked well and they'll always work well.
*  And I also think there's great data emerging
*  that they transform mental health.
*  I mean, the data on resistance training
*  two or three times a week and mental health is striking.
*  I mean, compare that to what people get from certain SSRIs
*  and you're like, for goodness sake, 45, 60 minutes a week,
*  lift some heavy objects.
*  You feel better.
*  And it literally has better statistical results
*  than SSRIs, which is pretty nuts.
*  And I know you've talked about this recently
*  and I'm kind of like hitting a bunch of things here,
*  but I think a lot about this relationship
*  between traditional science, FDA, NIH.
*  I reviewed grants for the NIH for years
*  until very recently I was a regular study section member.
*  I understand the process.
*  I understand the limitations and the benefits.
*  And I also understand that like in the cases recently
*  where the FDA decided to not approve MDMA
*  for the treatment of PTSD, you go like, whoa,
*  what's it going to take?
*  I think, you know, I had a lot of feelings
*  about that ruling.
*  I think it's unfortunate given the really strong data
*  that support the use of MDMA for the treatment of PTSD.
*  I mean, more than 60%, you know, successful in air quotes,
*  plus some people just go into total remission,
*  but the hazards are there.
*  And if there aren't safeguards in place
*  for the practitioner patient relationship,
*  which is one of the major concerns, if those aren't there,
*  well, then it's never going to be legalized.
*  So what is the hazard of the participant
*  with the person that's helping them?
*  So there were two major issues plus some others,
*  but the ones that I'm most aware of
*  is that lack of an adequate control group.
*  People don't know if they got the drug or they didn't.
*  And then the other one is during the course of the trials,
*  there were some issues that came up about
*  improprieties between practitioners and patients.
*  Oh, like sexual stuff?
*  My understanding is that there were certain things
*  may have arisen that kind of like pricked up,
*  you know, people's ears.
*  But the major issue was this,
*  is a person who's under the influence of MDMA
*  in a position to advocate for what they need
*  during the course of the session, right?
*  Like are they in a quote unquote truly safe space?
*  But the same thing could be said of psilocybin trials.
*  So the solution there is my understanding
*  is that you have two therapists there.
*  It's not one therapist, one patient, two therapists.
*  That there are safeguards in place.
*  The same way that, you know,
*  when somebody, a brain surgeon does a brain surgery,
*  there's an anesthesiologist there and multiple nurses
*  and staff to get things and hemostats.
*  So I think that there needs to be,
*  I think a next phase evolution
*  of the way that we think about things like
*  MDMA assisted treatment for PTSD.
*  Cause I do think by my read of the data
*  and I've looked closely at these data,
*  despite a few retractions,
*  there's still a body of data that really point to
*  how powerfully helpful it can be for certain people
*  under the right conditions.
*  It's just striking.
*  And there's a tremendous amount of anecdotal data.
*  Just people who haven't been in a study,
*  but talk about the benefits that they've had from it
*  and how much it's, especially war veterans
*  with both psilocybin and MDMA.
*  And Ibogaine, the work that Veterans Solutions is doing
*  with a guy at Stanford, Nolan Williams
*  in our department of psychiatry.
*  He's been doing brain imaging before and after Ibogaine
*  with the veterans that are taking Ibogaine followed by DMT.
*  And those are looking very, very interesting.
*  To me, it's also the kind of emotional loading
*  of things like MDMA.
*  When we call it MDMA, if I tell you,
*  this is MDMA, this is a drug that raises serotonin
*  dramatically, raises dopamine dramatically,
*  opens neuroplasticity and allows people
*  to rewire their brains, if adequately supported,
*  to feel relief, if not remission from PTSD.
*  You'd say, awesome.
*  How do we move this forward safely?
*  But if I start using words like ecstasy,
*  I start using, now I call it what it really is,
*  MDMA, methylene dioxide, methamphetamine.
*  You hear methamphetamine, you hear ecstasy.
*  You start hearing a bunch of stuff
*  that starts shifting your brain towards,
*  okay, this is like a party drug, they wanna use it.
*  Same thing was said about cannabis.
*  I've done multiple episodes about cannabis.
*  I'm not anti-cannabis.
*  I think there's case studies where, excuse me,
*  that's a specific thing in science, use cases where,
*  or examples where people with a propensity for psychosis
*  should probably not be doing high THC cannabis.
*  I learned something really interesting,
*  by the way, about this.
*  We brought on an expert, brought on in part
*  where there was a little bit of a Twitter battle.
*  I put out a solo episode about cannabis years ago.
*  No one had a problem with it, put a clip on X.
*  Whoa, people came at me like crazy, like crazy.
*  So I invited one of the main academics
*  in that area onto my podcast.
*  He eventually agreed.
*  What was his disagreement with?
*  He didn't like a bunch of things I said,
*  but mainly three statements.
*  One was that I said that there was evidence,
*  because there is a published paper, must say this,
*  there is a published paper looking at the differences
*  in subjective effects that people experience
*  with sativa versus indica strains.
*  And he said, there's no evidence
*  that there's a different experience
*  from sativa versus indica strains.
*  That's just all bud tender lore.
*  You shouldn't be saying this.
*  He doesn't smoke weed.
*  That's just not true.
*  So I said, wait, here's the paper.
*  Here's the paper.
*  Then there were a couple other things.
*  One is I said-
*  Did he agree once he read the paper?
*  He said he would like to see more evidence.
*  When he came on, he was very gracious,
*  offered a lot of useful knowledge,
*  but he really didn't counter with that much.
*  There were some issues around CB,
*  about CBD biology versus THC.
*  What is his field of expertise?
*  He works on animal models, but focuses on cannabis biology.
*  And so he's very knowledgeable.
*  And I don't think he's anti-cannabis at all,
*  but he was checking me on some things that he felt that I-
*  Maybe he does smoke weed.
*  Yeah, he's from Canada.
*  He's a very nice guy.
*  He was checking me on some things that he felt
*  I had not gotten correctly
*  or that weren't adequately supported.
*  So my response was, I did this publicly,
*  come on the podcast.
*  Like, I'm not afraid to talk science.
*  That's what I do.
*  Like, let's go.
*  And not in a combative way.
*  He agreed to come on the podcast.
*  We had a great discussion.
*  And one of the things that he said was
*  the whole idea that there's so much more THC in weed now
*  that's leading to all these problems.
*  Like the weed of today is not the weed of yesterday.
*  He said when people inhale,
*  they take it by vape or they smoke it or whatever.
*  His words are that there's far fewer cases
*  of people taking in more.
*  They're able to reach that point that they want to be at
*  without going too far.
*  However, even though it's higher potency,
*  however, when people take it by edible,
*  there are cases where people get to genuinely freak out
*  in psychotic episodes
*  because they're taking in far too much too quickly
*  because you can eat the edible quickly.
*  They're not layering in until they hit that plane
*  that they want to be at.
*  That's also the conversion to 11 hydroxy metabolite.
*  That's five times more psychoactive than THC.
*  I used to do a joke about it that lets you talk to dolphins.
*  It's a true story about edibles and dolphin experience.
*  So he wasn't anti-cannabis.
*  And in fact, I think it was a case where
*  maybe this brings us back to Twitter
*  where Twitter was a very valuable tool.
*  So I put out something.
*  I was going off the literature that I cited.
*  He said, no, no, no, no, listen, there's some issues here.
*  You should adjust this.
*  We brought him on the podcast.
*  He was reluctant to come on the podcast.
*  He thought I was going to set him up for a fall.
*  We've never done that.
*  He comes on the podcast, got the information out there.
*  And then it all just kind of went to
*  like a quiet simmer or nothing.
*  And in the end, I think that's the way
*  that all of this stuff should be handled.
*  Whether or not you're talking about one medical treatment
*  or another is, and this is the way you've done it.
*  And this is the example you've laid out for me
*  and for others, right?
*  Which is talk about both sides.
*  Talk to vegans, talk to carnivores, talk to omnivores,
*  talk to people who are pro-cannabis anti
*  and worried about psychosis and not.
*  Talk to people that are really pro MDMA
*  for the treatment of PTSD.
*  Talk to people who are very reluctant.
*  I think only there can we get the overlap
*  in the Venn diagram about what the agreements are
*  and what the disagreements are and move forward.
*  And this is-
*  Especially long form, because then you get to understand
*  how a person thinks about things,
*  not just the subject at hand, but maybe other things.
*  You get to hear their speech patterns
*  and their thinking patterns.
*  And I think direct experience is real.
*  Cam Haynes pointed this out recently,
*  and I'm not saying this to focus the positive energy on us,
*  but it will invariably do that or inevitably do that.
*  Excuse me.
*  Which is, he said, it's kind of interesting
*  that all of the top podcasters really fit.
*  All the people that are really into their health, right?
*  Like you and there's David's out there, influencers.
*  He was saying there's a health component
*  or a fitness component.
*  Not always, but I think most of them.
*  I think he may have said all of them.
*  He may have said many of them.
*  But Chris Williams and Lex,
*  there's a tendency to merge intellectual discourse
*  with physical.
*  And I think that's a unique theme of podcasting also,
*  at least of certain, let's just say what it is,
*  a lot of the top podcasts,
*  that's a pretty consistent theme
*  for the female podcasters too.
*  Whitney works out, those are podcasts.
*  There's a kind of merging of those things.
*  And I think that when it comes to the discussion
*  about anything about health,
*  it also is beneficial if people are engaging
*  in healthy behaviors, right?
*  Or if they've tried things, like they're trying to be fit.
*  I see Rhonda posting pictures of herself deadlifting now.
*  And like Peter's talking about his workouts
*  and he's a physician, he's an MD.
*  So I think it's not sufficient to just study something,
*  to just look at the data in papers.
*  I think it really helps if you're able to get
*  in close contact with the things that you're hearing about.
*  But also it helps me to know whether or not
*  you have any discipline.
*  So there's people that think about a certain thing
*  because it comforts their own thoughts
*  about their decisions that they've made.
*  And there's certain rationales that people make.
*  They rationalize certain aspects of their life
*  and certain things that are going on in society
*  to sort of make up for the fact that they haven't done
*  the work that they probably should have done
*  in the first place.
*  So when I see a guy that's built like Chris or Lex
*  or someone who I know or yourself
*  that I know stays very physically fit
*  and takes care of their health,
*  then I have more respect for them.
*  Because I go, okay, I have more respect
*  for this person's opinion because this person
*  is doing difficult things on a regular basis
*  and confronting their own hesitations,
*  their whatever procrastination, discipline issues,
*  and the physical ability to put in work
*  which requires mental strength.
*  And for the longest time, for whatever strange reason,
*  people have had this mutually exclusive notion
*  that a person who is physically fit is probably stupid
*  and a person who doesn't care about their body
*  and only concentrates on the mind,
*  for some reason that is admired,
*  that this person has no ego at all and doesn't care.
*  But that I think that person's a fool
*  because you don't have as much energy to think
*  because your physical body that you have,
*  you've let decay to this terrible point
*  where your posture's down.
*  I've had some unfortunate conversations
*  with older intellectuals that don't take care of themselves.
*  And you realize that at a certain point
*  they've gotten lazy physically
*  and they don't have the energy to engage.
*  And so they just repeat things that they've said
*  over and over and over again.
*  And when you ask them to think on the spot,
*  they almost don't have the will to do it anymore.
*  It sucks.
*  Yeah, it does suck.
*  And there's a direct correlation between this ability
*  to continue moving your body and your intellectual ability.
*  I mean, you have to still go and learn and read
*  and acquire knowledge and try hard things.
*  You just can't just work out.
*  But I can think of a number of key examples
*  that are historical.
*  The greatest neurobiologist of all time,
*  supernatural levels of ability was a guy named Ramon y Cajal
*  won the Nobel Prize in 1906.
*  He was the one who first defined the synapse, et cetera.
*  He carried an iron umbrella to work.
*  He lifted weights.
*  Oliver Sacks, one of the greatest neurologists
*  and writers of our time, passed away in 2015,
*  had a 600 pound squat.
*  Okay. Jesus.
*  Yeah, he had the state power,
*  a state powerlifting record at one point.
*  Just a beast of a guy who was also a neurologist
*  and wrote all these beautiful books
*  about how the mind works.
*  The man who mistook his wife for a hat.
*  He was behind the movie, awakenings, et cetera, et cetera.
*  Don Kennedy, former president of Stanford,
*  ran into his late seventies.
*  And then after that had a hip replacement
*  and then was doing other stuff.
*  So Richard Axel was a Nobel Prize from Columbia University.
*  First person to find ways to introduce genes
*  to novel genes to cells.
*  Played racquetball.
*  I don't know if he's still playing racquetball.
*  I'll name one more.
*  These are incredible people.
*  Like the guy who essentially defined the understanding
*  of the visual system and neuroplasticity.
*  My scientific great grandfather,
*  there's David Hubel and Torrance and Riesel.
*  Torrance and just turned something like 95 or something.
*  Maybe it's 93.
*  He still runs.
*  He runs slowly, but he still goes, and he is mentally sharp.
*  So this is not an accident.
*  This is not just a correlation.
*  This is the anterior mid-singulate cortex in action.
*  And of course cancer, a bus or a bullet
*  can still take you out.
*  But assuming you make it into your 60s, 70s, 80s,
*  movement, movement, movement is the way
*  to stay mentally strong and to continue
*  to have the capacity to learn.
*  I mean, just to kind of weave these two things.
*  If we're talking about MDMA, psilocybin,
*  or some other agent that raises serotonin and dopamine,
*  or we're talking about movement,
*  all we're really talking about
*  are ways to increase these neuromodulators
*  like dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, epinephrine.
*  And they create the opportunity for neuroplasticity.
*  They don't create plasticity on their own.
*  They create a milieu that's very much like the young brain
*  where it's like, okay, what's new here?
*  This is why adrenaline is such a powerful tool
*  for plasticity.
*  Probably, I'm not going to suggest people
*  use smelling salts to try and do better on their exams.
*  There are other ways to do better on their exams.
*  I probably will take another one.
*  Okay.
*  I can tell you were thinking about it.
*  All right.
*  Get in there, sir.
*  Take a step.
*  I almost.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And now to the right.
*  No, let's go.
*  Because we alternated, remember the alternate.
*  Let me see if I alternated.
*  I don't remember which one got me the first time.
*  It was left before, it's definitely right.
*  Oh, man.
*  Makes your eyes water a little bit,
*  but boy, it does shock your system.
*  Wow.
*  That little adrenaline I could lift more.
*  Well, I told myself I wasn't going to cry on this podcast
*  because I cried on a podcast recently of mine.
*  We kept it in, but now I'm crying,
*  these are tears of related to the smell.
*  Yeah, this is tears, just sort of chemicals
*  rotting your brain.
*  You're supposed to not do that more than twice a day,
*  but we've done it many times.
*  So it's just this thing, neuroplasticity,
*  like does it really?
*  That's from your sinuses.
*  By the way, it's like.
*  You have some skulls around here.
*  Like the sinuses run from here and through to the,
*  that's why when you get a sinus infection,
*  you're clear here.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So, but neuroplasticity is the most impressive feature
*  of the human brain.
*  It can rewire itself, but when you're a kid,
*  you rewire in response to a passive experience,
*  for better or worse.
*  As an adult, you can rewire your brain,
*  but you have to create the milieu,
*  the environment that the brain wants to rewire itself.
*  So these neuromodulators like adrenaline or dopamine
*  or serotonin, they need to be spiked.
*  And nicotine, what you're now taking in another one,
*  is we know comes, does many things in the brain and body,
*  but God, that stuff's strong.
*  Yeah, man.
*  There's a brain area called nucleus basalis,
*  which sits in the base of the brain,
*  and it can serve as a spotlight
*  by releasing acetylcholine onto what?
*  Onto nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in certain circuits
*  and provide focus.
*  So that's what nicotine's doing,
*  unless you take so much of it every day,
*  that those, your kind of baseline levels of acetylcholine
*  either drop or become kind of regulated
*  to the point where you're not getting
*  that spotlighting anymore,
*  which is why people then are taking more and more.
*  But as our, you know, your former guest
*  and my colleague, Dr. Analemki has said,
*  the worst thing you can do
*  when you're in a trough of dopamine
*  is try and boost dopamine again.
*  You just got to wait for it to come back.
*  So if people want nicotine to continue to work,
*  they should use it sporadically,
*  or when they feel like it's not working anymore,
*  take a break.
*  That's what McKenna used to say about cannabis.
*  McKenna, who would, Terrence McKenna,
*  would freely admit that he had a problem with cannabis,
*  because he was like a daily cannabis user.
*  But he said the real way to take it,
*  he said, is to take a long time off,
*  a long time off,
*  so that your body's completely desensitized to it,
*  and then take as much as you can stand in like one dose.
*  Like that's, he was interested in it as a psychedelic.
*  You know, especially if you do that in edible form,
*  it just, it is a very, very potent psychedelic.
*  But there is that concern,
*  and I think this is a very important thing to bring up.
*  It's not benign, and certainly not to everybody.
*  Nicotine.
*  Marijuana.
*  Oh.
*  Everybody has a different reaction to it.
*  And some people have a terrible reaction to it.
*  Psychosis.
*  Yes, and I don't understand it because I don't get it.
*  It doesn't happen to me,
*  but I also know that it's real,
*  and to deny it as a zealot,
*  and to say, oh, marijuana's just great,
*  everybody should be high.
*  Like, no, no, no, everybody shouldn't eat peanuts either.
*  You know, some people have a weird reaction to things,
*  and there's a certain, I mean,
*  Alex Berenson wrote that book,
*  Tell Your Parents, or Tell Your Children?
*  Tell Your Children.
*  It's all about that.
*  About, there needs to be some recognition,
*  but there's a certain percentage of people
*  that have a tendency towards schizophrenia,
*  or maybe psychotic breaks,
*  and they can get triggered by high doses of cannabis.
*  For sure.
*  No question.
*  I know people that it's happened to.
*  Yeah, and I covered that in my solo episode on cannabis.
*  Then this person, this researcher from Canada,
*  I don't think he's pro or anti-cannabis,
*  but had differing views, came on my podcast, and then-
*  What's his name?
*  Matt Hill.
*  And he's a respected researcher in this area,
*  and I thought his stance was very nuanced.
*  And then after he came on the podcast,
*  other people, not Berenson necessarily,
*  although I haven't checked my DMs that closely,
*  contacted me and said, no, I have counters to that guy,
*  which just told me everything I already know,
*  which is that science is a field
*  with people with differing opinions, right?
*  Which is good.
*  Which is great.
*  I mean, you don't have a field
*  until you have differing opinions.
*  You don't want to be the only person working on something.
*  You want that.
*  It's something that you can tell I get really impassioned,
*  smelling salts or no, about this,
*  because somehow in the media version of,
*  is cannabis good, is cannabis bad?
*  And honestly, the political aspects to it,
*  like I wasn't tracking the fact that cannabis
*  was just about to be approved for more legalization
*  right about the time that that clip got amplified.
*  But I wasn't saying it should or shouldn't.
*  I'm just giving you the information,
*  same as I did for alcohol.
*  Right.
*  I would love to put this to rest once and for all.
*  Every couple of weeks or months,
*  you're going to see media outlets say,
*  some drinking is good for you.
*  Others will say, some drinking, any drink is bad for you.
*  Here's the deal.
*  Zero is better than any.
*  A little bit's probably fine,
*  especially if you do other things to offset the sleep loss
*  and microbiome stuff.
*  If you're going to drink,
*  probably should be doing other healthy behaviors
*  anyway.
*  No one's saying it's terrible.
*  I'll have a drink every once in a while.
*  I'm not an alcoholic.
*  If you're a non-alcoholic adult, one or two,
*  I love like a good white tequila with soda and lime.
*  So good.
*  But I don't really like alcohol enough
*  to be able to comment past that.
*  But, and I haven't had a drink in years,
*  but the reality is that one study after another saying,
*  moderate drinking is good for you.
*  No drinking is better for you.
*  Cancer is, this is never going to stop.
*  It's a field.
*  Now we have enough data, people can make their decision.
*  Everyone knows sleep is important.
*  There's no field to be had except to how to figure out
*  to get sleep better, in my opinion.
*  Sleep deprivation's bad,
*  but you're not going to get dementia
*  or die from a couple bad nights sleep.
*  That's also true.
*  So it's almost like the way things have split politically
*  has become the way that health information has split.
*  And I'm fighting tooth and nail,
*  and I know you are and other people are as well,
*  to try and continue to shine light
*  on the field that is psychedelics,
*  the field that includes cannabis,
*  the field that includes things like weight loss,
*  no Zempik, but also exercise and all the other good things.
*  And somehow, and maybe you can tell me,
*  because I'm new to the more, to the media thing,
*  newer than you, certainly.
*  For some reason, people don't like that.
*  It's like the brain needs like a black and white thing.
*  It's like they can't seem to just deal with the fact
*  that like, look, you'll find evidence for
*  and evidence against you.
*  You just got to make the best decision for you.
*  Well, there's also people that write articles
*  with a specific narrative because they're gamifying
*  the social media algorithms, they're gamifying clickbait.
*  So it's business.
*  Gamifying clickbait is real.
*  I mean, it's a, unfortunately,
*  one of the things that happened in journalism
*  is people stopped buying newspapers.
*  And when people stop buying newspapers,
*  the only way someone can,
*  you can get someone to go to your website
*  and click on a link,
*  so you have to have some sort of inflammatory headline,
*  something that excites you, something that angers you,
*  something that like, gives you some information,
*  some secret information that wasn't available before.
*  Oh, let me click on that.
*  I didn't know that.
*  But science to me is about facts.
*  And I totally agree.
*  I just, you know, I think that Rick Rubin,
*  I seem to, he seems to come to mind a lot to me today.
*  But, you know, he once said to me,
*  we're in discussion, I discovered a bunch of lies
*  in somebody's life.
*  And I was like, oh my God.
*  And he just said, very calmly, he said,
*  look, it's all lies.
*  And I'm like, what do you mean?
*  I'm like, that's the problem.
*  I'm realizing it's all lies.
*  And he said, listen, it's all lies, back to nature.
*  That's the only truth.
*  And I'm like, yeah, that's why I became a scientist.
*  And then he said, oh wait, end professional wrestling.
*  Cause everyone knows that's made up.
*  So it's real.
*  And I actually went to the AEW with Rick.
*  It was wild.
*  And by the way-
*  He loves that shit.
*  Well, they're jumping around in the ring
*  and they'll stop every once in a while and look and go,
*  hey, Rick Rubin, like it's wild.
*  Like he's that much of a fixture.
*  It's so great.
*  He's there with his red light,
*  with his red lens glasses and the whole thing.
*  He does the sunlight.
*  He's gotten much healthier.
*  He looks great.
*  He takes really great care of himself.
*  But I think he's right.
*  I think nature has a truth.
*  It has an order to it.
*  Science's job is to try and unveil that truth
*  to the best of our abilities.
*  But wrestling, admittedly, everyone agrees it's made up.
*  So at least we agree on that.
*  Whereas I think so much of what we've been talking
*  about today is like the media,
*  like at what point do we realize there are portions
*  that are true, there are portions that are made up.
*  Well, they're making themselves obsolete.
*  And this is what I believe.
*  I believe that human beings should be able
*  to differ on opinions.
*  But I should know that you're being honest
*  and you're telling the truth.
*  So as soon as you write something that I know is biased
*  and twisted and you've distorted things
*  and taking things out of context,
*  well, I know that you're not in the truth game.
*  So your opinion's nonsense.
*  Whatever you say is horse shit.
*  I wanna talk to someone that's trying to figure out
*  what's right and what's wrong.
*  Not someone who's trying to win.
*  And everybody's trying to win.
*  This is a real problem.
*  It's a real problem.
*  It's win the discussion.
*  They attach whatever the discussion is,
*  whether it's weightlifting is more important than cardio
*  or you should be a vegan versus you should be a carnivore.
*  They attach whatever this argument is
*  to their own sense of self-worth.
*  And it's very important to them
*  that they counter your arguments
*  and win this little chess match.
*  And that's what it is.
*  They're playing a little game.
*  I play games.
*  So I don't like playing games when I talk to people.
*  I like playing pool.
*  The game is like making people laugh.
*  The game is jujitsu.
*  How do I get your back?
*  These are games I like.
*  I like games.
*  So when I communicate, I don't like games.
*  But I recognize that especially earlier in my life
*  before I started recognizing patterns in podcasts.
*  What don't I like when people are talking?
*  I don't like when someone's biased.
*  I don't like when someone is talking over people.
*  I don't like when someone's misrepresenting someone's words
*  or someone's trying to win
*  rather than considering what the other person's saying.
*  So when someone's considering what the other person's saying,
*  then you get this beautiful sort of sharing of ideas
*  without ego.
*  And the real problem is the ego.
*  The ego getting attached to winning a conversation
*  and being correct.
*  Yeah, well yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  And they get in this fucking frenzy
*  where they can't even communicate anymore.
*  And they're completely attached and married to their ideas.
*  The best thing, the best advice I can give people on this
*  is don't be attached to your ideas.
*  They're just ideas.
*  Examine why you believe them.
*  There's many times in my life
*  where someone has hit me with some facts
*  and I've thought about my ego.
*  Oh, you know why I believe that?
*  This is why, because I thought this.
*  And then I was saying, well, if you believe that,
*  then this has to be untrue.
*  And I'm like, I don't want to say that.
*  So I've attached myself to this thing.
*  And now I've connected my,
*  and when I'm engaging with someone,
*  I'm not just engaging in this pure intellectual sharing
*  of ideas and a discussion of merit.
*  I'm now in a win-lose situation.
*  I'm trying to win.
*  I could win by deception.
*  And you see people do that all the time.
*  And it's so gross when you catch people
*  doing that on a podcast.
*  When you realize like,
*  you're not even considering these other possibilities,
*  because you're dismissing them without any consideration,
*  because you just want to achieve a goal of victory.
*  You just want to play checkmate.
*  And that's all they're doing.
*  And that's why the media is going to make themselves obsolete
*  because that's not happening in podcasts.
*  In the best podcasts, whether it's Chris Williamson,
*  whether it's Lex Friedman,
*  the best podcasts are a true conversation.
*  And I want to know why you think the way you think.
*  And when I get that in my head, I can consider it.
*  And then I can say, well, this is why
*  I don't think that's true.
*  Because I think this way, this is my perspective.
*  I might be wrong, I might be right.
*  Who knows?
*  But this is just how I feel.
*  When you can do that and learn how to do that,
*  and it took me a while to learn how to do that,
*  it makes all conversations better.
*  It makes all friendships better.
*  You get to really understand why a person,
*  maybe you and a buddy had a disagreement about something.
*  You say, well, what did you think?
*  I thought you were going to do that.
*  I'm like, I never said I was going to do that.
*  Why would I do that?
*  I thought you were going to do that.
*  But we didn't talk about that, did we?
*  No.
*  So you're mad at something
*  that you didn't even talk to me about.
*  And you thought that I should have just known.
*  Come on, man.
*  That's crazy.
*  You're just attributing all these negative things
*  to a person, and then you can work things out.
*  You can talk about things,
*  as long as the person's not bullshitting you.
*  As soon as you've got people in your life
*  that are bullshitting you, it's like,
*  oh, you're not even having real conversations.
*  You're playing a stupid game of tic-tac-toe all day long
*  with your friends.
*  When your friends can open up to you,
*  and this is one of the reasons why people like sharing
*  embarrassing information with friends,
*  because I know I can trust you.
*  I can tell you the stupid fucking thing that I did.
*  And you go, oh my God, I did that too.
*  You're like, ah!
*  And then you, no.
*  But when a person goes, well, I would never fucking do that.
*  I ought to figure that out long time ago.
*  I wouldn't have done it that way.
*  Like, oh, well, that guy's a dick.
*  He's not willing to be vulnerable with me,
*  because he always wants to be socially a step up.
*  He wants his status to be in a position of,
*  this is the guy that doesn't make those mistakes,
*  which is crazy.
*  That's crazy, especially among friends.
*  I've always been blessed that there's been very,
*  if any, hierarchy of my friends.
*  We knew who was better at certain things than others.
*  This should never be, we're just human beings.
*  There are people that are way better at certain things
*  than I am, that I'm friends with.
*  And that's how it should be.
*  There's people that I'm friends with
*  that are way smarter than me, you included.
*  And it's okay.
*  No, I'm not smart, it's just different form of intelligence.
*  And I'm not just saying that.
*  With each passing year,
*  and I've looked forward to approaching 50,
*  because I'm like, now I can say things
*  like with each passing year, or by this stage.
*  Yeah.
*  But I also realized the other day,
*  I lived a long period of my life
*  where I didn't really have a sense
*  of the fact that I would die.
*  I'd watched the Steve Jobs commencement speech at Stanford
*  where he talked, 2005, where he talks about this notion
*  that we're going to die is so critical.
*  And I couldn't get in touch with it.
*  Recently, I'm like, oh, like time's going to come up.
*  Every time I go down for a meditation,
*  I do this like non-sleep deep rest, yoga, knee-dra-media,
*  I like go do the long exhale.
*  I'm like, someday it's going to just be last exhale.
*  And I'm not looking forward to dying.
*  Lord knows I'm not looking forward to dying.
*  But I realized, I'm like, this is great.
*  It's very freeing,
*  because I had this realization the other day
*  in a meditation, no psychedelics involved in this one.
*  And I realized like, I can continue
*  to just be curious and explore.
*  And like, I think it's that ego detachment,
*  a little slice of that.
*  Like, this is bad, this is good.
*  I'm learning from this, this was good, this was hard.
*  I learned a lot from that.
*  I learned what I needed to change from that
*  and just be moving forward.
*  It's this removing this thing of like,
*  like you said, like this game all day long of like,
*  not that I was in that mode or I didn't think I was,
*  but this need to win, right?
*  It's sort of like being an explorer.
*  I'm a brain explorer.
*  I've been a brain explorer for a long time.
*  I love biology, love animals.
*  Like I'm an explorer.
*  And I think the definition of curiosity to me
*  is that you're not attached to the outcome.
*  You just want to know what's real.
*  Right, but too many people are attached to the outcome.
*  And I think that's a tremendous trap.
*  And that's why I wanted to talk about it,
*  because it's something that I had to learn,
*  because I was always attached to winning an argument.
*  If I got into a discussion, a disagreement with someone,
*  I was always attached to being the one who was correct.
*  When did that fall away for you?
*  At what, you're about-
*  57.
*  All right, so you're-
*  It's, you know, I've gotten way better at it over time.
*  I don't, I wouldn't want to like sit and figure out
*  when I figured it out,
*  but I figured steps of it out along the way.
*  You know, I remember being 21
*  and watching a comedian go on stage,
*  and I wanted him to bomb.
*  And I realized that that was a terrible weakness.
*  And I was embarrassed that I had that feeling.
*  So interesting.
*  I will say, we know how we feel about people
*  when we see them succeed.
*  Because I think there's this natural reflex,
*  like when you hear like,
*  oh, that really shitty person that you knew in school,
*  like they got pancreatic cancer,
*  everyone just goes, oh, like that sucks, that sucks.
*  But when you hear, hey, you know that person
*  that you used to really dislike
*  or that you had friction with,
*  and like, they just like IPO'd, like they're doing great.
*  You know, you know immediately,
*  do I like that person or not?
*  Right, right, right.
*  Because if you're happy for them, presumably you like them.
*  Right, yeah.
*  Rarely is it neutral either.
*  I mean, I can't think of anyone
*  that I'm like don't want to see succeed
*  except maybe a few individuals I think are actually evil,
*  but those are extremely rare.
*  But I think it sounds like you're also a competitive person.
*  I didn't do a lot of competitive sports.
*  I'm very curious about this.
*  Like I'm competitive with myself,
*  but like you did combat sport.
*  Yeah. Right?
*  I did skateboarding, played a little soccer,
*  did some swimming, running, weightlifting.
*  You know, like your brain was weaned
*  in fighting a lot of the time.
*  Well, it was also how I developed as a child.
*  I mean, I went from all my puberty years competing.
*  So that like from 15 on,
*  that's literally what I did all day long.
*  And your goal is to knock the other guy out.
*  Yeah, it's a fucked up way to develop your mind.
*  If you do develop like this insane kind of hyper competitive
*  because it's the consequences are so grave.
*  You know, I would say about MMA
*  that it's high level problem solving
*  with dire physical consequences.
*  And that's really what it is.
*  It's high level problem solving.
*  You're literally doing combat, hand to hand combat
*  with your body with someone who's an expert at it,
*  which is so crazy.
*  Like, so you're fighting a black belt is so crazy.
*  This is a person who's dedicated their life
*  to kicking people into the shadow realm.
*  And you're deciding to try to kick them first
*  before they kick you, which is just nuts.
*  It's a nutty way to live.
*  But the negative aspects of it
*  are you develop this hyper competitiveness
*  because you're also developing at an accelerated rate
*  when you're a teenager.
*  All right, so when I was a teenager, I had no bills.
*  I had no problems.
*  I lived at home.
*  I didn't have any real like an adult type stress,
*  family to feed, dealing with the community, work problems.
*  I had nothing.
*  So my entire focus was just on this one thing,
*  martial arts, and you can get way better when you're a kid.
*  It's like this neuroplasticity involved.
*  Until 25, your brain is a plasticity machine.
*  Yeah.
*  It's there to map according to your experience.
*  I mean, like literally coming into the world,
*  baby's flopping, like, you know, like little bug,
*  move, move, move, move.
*  Neuronal connections are being removed
*  by the thousands, tens of thousands by the day
*  so that you get fine-tuned movement.
*  It's like you're a plasticity machine.
*  And then you're thinking and your notions about boys
*  and girls and teachers and parents
*  and good things and bad things and what that means
*  and what that means and who's a hero and who's a villain.
*  Like the brain is just placing things
*  into boxes and symbols.
*  It's like, it's an unbelievable phenomenon.
*  And it's happening when you're a teenager,
*  then you throw hormones into the mix.
*  People often don't talk about this.
*  Then you add hormones and now you're adding the drive
*  that is hormones related to like really hardwired,
*  evolutionarily selected things like reproduction, fighting.
*  Right? We all have brain circuits for fighting.
*  There's a brain area.
*  David Anderson's laboratory at Caltech has studied this.
*  I think we've talked about before.
*  You stimulate this little region
*  of the ventromedial hypothalamus, the specific neurons,
*  and the animals will mate.
*  They'll mount or the females will go into lordosis.
*  They'll arch their back to expose their genitals.
*  You stimulate other neurons in that exact same area,
*  ventromedial hypothalamus.
*  You know what happens?
*  They go into a rage.
*  They want to rip apart the other animal.
*  There are videos of this online.
*  You can put the mouse in there
*  with a plastic glove filled with air,
*  stimulate these neurons
*  and the animal will just attack that thing.
*  Wow.
*  And then you stop the stimulation
*  and the animal just stops.
*  Wow, little robots.
*  Our brains have these circuits.
*  As Jung said, we have all things inside of us.
*  The extent to which we learn to suppress or exacerbate
*  depends on experience, its nature and nurture.
*  But we come into this world hardwired with the capacity
*  for most any of these behaviors to emerge.
*  Your daughter fortunately got very good at drawing, right?
*  That probably is handed off through some slight genetic bias
*  handed on through you and your partner, your wife,
*  to create a slight bias towards looking at the world
*  in a particular way, an artistic sense,
*  something about aesthetics,
*  pay attention to curved corners versus square corners,
*  whatever it is.
*  But what we do feeds back on that circuit.
*  So if you draw more, you get better at drawing.
*  This is the nature.
*  That's a big thing.
*  She draws all day long.
*  And she's been doing it since she was really little,
*  but also like going back to Floyd Mayweather,
*  Floyd Mayweather started boxing when he was a little kid.
*  And there's a thing about striking,
*  and it's not a hard, fast rule
*  because there's some freaks out there,
*  some athletic freaks,
*  and there's some people that come from other sports
*  that have incredible speed and dexterity
*  and an understanding of their body
*  that allows them to pick up striking better than other.
*  But there's something about people that learn
*  when they're young that are always better than everybody.
*  No matter how good you are,
*  there's certain guys like Anderson Silva,
*  or there's certain fighters that learn at a young age,
*  and you just can't fuck with them.
*  They're just too good.
*  Their nervous system was shaped in fighting,
*  the same way Tiger Woods's nervous system
*  was shaped golfing.
*  That's why when Floyd sees those punches coming,
*  he knows all he has to do is this,
*  and it's just going to just barely touch his chin,
*  and then he fires back.
*  Like he knows, he's been in those patterns
*  for his whole life, and his body evolved.
*  It literally developed in those patterns.
*  This is why when people say like, what should I do?
*  I always think, like, I don't know what people should do,
*  and I took a formal education path eventually,
*  but if we look back to the things that really delighted us
*  and that we naturally oriented towards when we were young,
*  there's often information there.
*  For me, it was animals and fish tanks and biology.
*  I wanted to understand things, right?
*  And parse things through an understanding of some structure
*  because the world just, that's what it pulled out of me.
*  My dad's a scientist, so it's probably some genetic thing
*  and probably some nurture stuff as well.
*  I went up, I'm a big track and field fan,
*  and went up to the Olympic track and field trials
*  in Eugene, Oregon.
*  I love the town of Eugene.
*  I go to every trials I can for the last,
*  gosh, four Olympic trials.
*  And earlier that summer,
*  I ran into a guy named Cole Hawker.
*  This is shorter guy for a runner.
*  He runs the 1500, so it's about a mile, right?
*  And he took the first position there,
*  so he went off to Paris and he came from,
*  it's an amazing race.
*  If you didn't watch the 1500 race
*  at this year's Paris Olympics, it's amazing.
*  If you need, if anyone needs motivation,
*  you should get it from the inside is my belief,
*  but if you need to look outside, which we all occasionally do,
*  check out this race.
*  Cole comes from like fourth or fifth position
*  against the world record holder.
*  He's shorter, he doesn't have the stride
*  that these other guys have, and they box him in,
*  and he goes out and around and beats them all,
*  takes the gold.
*  It's one of these like pre-fontaine moments, right?
*  Now here's what's crazy and relates to what you're saying.
*  He's posting on Instagram afterwards.
*  I happen to know him a little bit.
*  Cam and I went and watched the trials together,
*  which is a real pleasure.
*  And Cam's like a legend.
*  These Olympic gold medal winners were coming up to him,
*  running, we got great seats, right?
*  And I gifted him a seat
*  because I'm very grateful to Cam for, okay, here's Cole,
*  Cole's a USA in fifth position.
*  I don't know where this is in that there's a fairly long race.
*  So there he is going on the outside.
*  No, so you might want to just go a little further
*  because this is a lot.
*  This is the guy with the man bun,
*  because now he has a flap.
*  He's the man with the man bun,
*  but he's man with a capital M-A-N, I'll tell you, you'll see.
*  Super nice guy too.
*  So this guy from Norway, Inger Bredsen,
*  he and his brothers have like a reality TV show.
*  They're like famous over there.
*  He's world record holder, also great runner, but cocky.
*  He's like talking a lot before us.
*  So check this out.
*  So I don't know how far along we have to go before.
*  Damn, they're running fast as fuck for a mile.
*  That's so crazy that they get run at that speed.
*  Right, final lap.
*  So watch this.
*  So he breaks from fifth position
*  after they box him in to win.
*  Wow. I don't know if you caught that,
*  but basically he's fifth position.
*  So he kicks at the end and takes it all at the end
*  against the world record holder.
*  Now here's where it gets even.
*  Oh, here we go.
*  He just skipped back.
*  He was just way back there.
*  Yeah, so he's way back.
*  And then they box him in later and he wins.
*  How, what do you mean by box him in?
*  So you'll see.
*  So you'll see what happens.
*  So it seems like he's going on the outside now.
*  Right, so he wants, he knows he's got a great kick.
*  So it's like calculating when to go 100%.
*  So Inger Bredsen went out really fast in this race,
*  fast pace.
*  So now he's trying to come around, right?
*  So now watch this.
*  So now he's trying to, this is the box in, you'll see.
*  He's trying to take the inside track.
*  And these two guys don't want him to do that.
*  Exactly.
*  He actually touches Inger Bredsen.
*  He actually touches him on his back hip
*  with the outside of his arm.
*  It's weird there's no rule.
*  There it is.
*  He sees if there's space.
*  Inger Bredsen's not going to let him in.
*  And so he goes, you know what?
*  How about this instead?
*  How about I come out?
*  He doesn't come, sorry.
*  He stayed inside track and he breaks through.
*  So it's just like, they try to keep you from,
*  you can kind of fit two people in the lane
*  and they try to keep you from doing that.
*  Yeah, they boxed him in.
*  They boxed him in.
*  Here's what's wild.
*  So afterwards there's a bunch of posting on Instagram.
*  Then they show a picture of Cole Hocker
*  when he's like eight years old holding a medal
*  where he was running the 1500
*  and he's doing like four minutes and change.
*  That's a mile.
*  He's a miler as a kid running four and some change
*  as a little kid.
*  That's crazy.
*  So this brings it back to your point,
*  which is like nowadays we're seeing the selection
*  of people who are probably have a genetic bias
*  towards something, a love of it like running, right?
*  Plus immense amounts of experience
*  and their nervous system, like he was shaped myeling.
*  That's a nervous system that miles.
*  I'll tell you, you can also walk and talk and eat
*  because I've met him, but that's a nervous system
*  that was shaped around running the 1500 mile.
*  So when you see it, they're like the top, top, top one percent.
*  It's so different than like my field
*  where you can't go to graduate school
*  to get a training in neuroscience
*  until you're in your twenties, unless you're a phenom.
*  So you can't go to school for this.
*  And so I think when people look at what they naturally
*  oriented to when they were young and they stayed with that,
*  that's the thing that you had a, maybe a genetic,
*  probably a genetic leaning towards.
*  Do you think there'll be maybe a shift today
*  because there's so much more material
*  that's available to young people?
*  Like if somebody has an interest in science,
*  neuroscience today.
*  Absolutely.
*  I think because of the online learning platforms,
*  I think of because of, I even liked the sport that I grew up
*  unfortunately wasn't very good at, or maybe fortunately,
*  who knows, I was skateboarding, right?
*  So many of my friends went on to start companies,
*  became pro skateboarders.
*  A lot of them didn't, but I didn't have a propensity for it.
*  Kept getting hurt, broke my foot three times.
*  I was like so frustrated.
*  It was unbelievable.
*  So I went in a different direction.
*  Went in the science direction.
*  Turned out to be my thing.
*  But now the little kids, literally little kids,
*  boys and girls, like this girl, Reese Nelson,
*  she skates with power on vert.
*  Not like a little kid going,
*  she's got power and technical.
*  And guys like Tony Hawk are like, whoa.
*  It's because they have all this exposure to 900s
*  and tricks and ramps.
*  And there's just way more people feeding the pool
*  of potential professional skateboarders.
*  So when you look at the Olympics or the X Games now,
*  you're getting a much greater selection
*  of the huge pool, bigger sample size feeding into it.
*  You're getting the genetic gifts.
*  Her mom travels with her everywhere.
*  She dedicates near 100% of her time to this.
*  So it's a lot of what you were saying,
*  like we're selecting earlier.
*  We're pulling from a larger pool.
*  So you're going to get the genetic freaks.
*  The pole vaulter guy keeps winning world records
*  or beating his own world record.
*  I saw him get at the worlds at Eugene
*  the last about two years ago.
*  Broke the world record.
*  He keeps beating the world record.
*  This guy's been pole vaulting his whole life.
*  He's been pulling for the whole kid.
*  So the earlier you get them,
*  the more the nervous system can be shaped that way.
*  Well, this is a problem that I see in combat sports
*  because in combat sports,
*  you have guys who have a championship mentality.
*  They could have been a champion,
*  but they didn't start early enough.
*  And even though they have this extraordinary mind,
*  so do the people that started when they were four.
*  This idea that you're tough
*  or you're the only one that's tough,
*  that's an egocentric idea that a lot of men have.
*  And it's a very bizarre conversation to have with these men.
*  I don't think he's tough.
*  I think if the going gets tough,
*  I'm like, you're never going to find out
*  that going gets tough.
*  He's going to fuck you up.
*  It's not even going to be hard for him.
*  You don't even understand what you're saying.
*  But there's the mind, the ego plays this,
*  cruel trick on you that doesn't allow you
*  to accurately assess your abilities.
*  So you have this bizarre notion
*  that you are exceptional for no reason whatsoever.
*  And there's a lot of men have that.
*  A lot of men have that bizarre thing.
*  The problem with if you have an incredible drive,
*  an incredible discipline,
*  but you didn't start striking until you're 26.
*  If you have a tie boxing fight against like a guy,
*  there's a guy right now who's one of the best in the world.
*  His name is Ta Wen Chai.
*  And he has this insane left kick.
*  He's like so left kick dominant.
*  Like most of his game is his left kick,
*  but it's so goddamn good.
*  He just slams it into the guy's arms,
*  slams into the guy's legs.
*  And he has this snake like movement of his ability
*  to just slide out of the way and then counter
*  and then slam you with a hard left low kick.
*  He's terrifying.
*  And I don't care how tough you are.
*  You don't have that ability.
*  And you probably are never gonna get there.
*  Like the margins, the differences of tenths of a second,
*  hundreds of a second here and there.
*  He's so good.
*  You're not gonna catch him.
*  So even if you're the baddest fucking dude in the world,
*  in your mind, this is Ta Wen Chai.
*  Let me hear some of this.
*  But go for the beginning.
*  Go to the beginning so you can hear the volume
*  of him hitting the pads.
*  This is not what you're looking for exactly.
*  This is like a highlight reel.
*  Yeah, but it's fine.
*  Go to the beginning where he hits the pads.
*  Oh, it's just good.
*  He's gonna music over it.
*  Oh, okay.
*  It's just music over.
*  But this guy is fucking nasty,
*  but he's all left kick.
*  Like it's like 80% of his game, man.
*  It's crazy how much of his game.
*  I mean, he can do everything.
*  The guy does everything.
*  But his left kick is so fucking powerful
*  that every time it hits you, your power bar goes down.
*  If he hits your arms, if he hits your body,
*  it's just like all left kick, bang, bang, bang.
*  And it's so smooth.
*  He's so good, man.
*  He's so good.
*  So if you're a guy and you're some badass Navy SEAL dude
*  and you're 30 years old and you make it to the Muay Thai gym
*  and you decide, hey, I'm only 30, I'm gonna fight pro.
*  You don't have enough time.
*  There's not enough time in the world
*  for you to get to where he's at
*  and he's gonna get better quicker.
*  Yeah, that guy's brain has a circuit.
*  I'm willing to wage my entire career on this.
*  That is a left kick circuit.
*  The same way that a tool like a bow
*  is designed for a specific thing,
*  that circuit is like left kick.
*  Bruce Lee had a saying that don't fear a man
*  who knows 10,000 kicks.
*  Fear a man who's practiced one kick 10,000 times.
*  There's a thing about a guy who's got this one thing
*  that's so like, Ryan Garcia has this nasty left hook.
*  It's the- That's kids super fast.
*  It's a crazy left hook.
*  It's so goddamn good.
*  It's so much better than most people's
*  that everybody who fights him doesn't understand
*  what he can do until he does it to you.
*  Just whips. Fast, powerful.
*  Fast, powerful, distance management,
*  angles that it comes from, it comes up, it comes around.
*  It just hits you faster than you know
*  it's supposed to get there.
*  It's so much quicker and has so much pop on it.
*  It's so dangerous.
*  And he fought Devin Haney,
*  who is one of the best pure boxers in the sport.
*  He's so good.
*  But he just didn't have the understanding yet
*  that a guy can whip that left hook so fast
*  and catch him and fuck him up in these weird angles.
*  It's, I don't wanna-
*  Watch this dude's left hook.
*  There's his liver shot right here.
*  There's his liver shot.
*  That's it.
*  Melted.
*  He melts a lot of guys, that liver shot.
*  See if you could just see,
*  give me a highlight of Ryan Garcia's knockouts.
*  He's got one of the,
*  I'm sure there's some of those online,
*  but it's all left hook.
*  Like he's got a right hand,
*  but so left hook dominant
*  and it's so much better than most weapons.
*  He's got a nasty left jab too,
*  but it's just,
*  he's got distance management and timing
*  and just the ability to just uncork a shot.
*  Like right there.
*  Ooh, fade away left hook.
*  He can out time it.
*  Oh, it's just-
*  Well, his speed is just different than other guys.
*  So you don't know that he can,
*  like look at that.
*  My goodness.
*  Look, he's a fade away left hook.
*  It's so perfect.
*  And when he connects,
*  everybody goes night night.
*  It's really extraordinary.
*  And it's extraordinary
*  because it's that one weapon that's so good.
*  And when he fought Devin Haney,
*  he was like,
*  Devin Haney's like,
*  he's only a left hook.
*  Whatever.
*  That's like saying,
*  Talenshah only has a left kick.
*  It's so good.
*  Only a left hook that wins.
*  A left hook that's so much better than everybody else's.
*  He's got a right hand too,
*  but that left hook is just freakish.
*  It's freakish.
*  Bink, right there.
*  So if we look at this through the lens of nervous systems,
*  I know that there've been conversations
*  that you've had here and elsewhere,
*  like would a crocodile versus a gorilla,
*  these kinds of crazy things.
*  We don't need to reignite that.
*  But I think when we're at the discussion
*  around true peak performance,
*  like somebody grew up running miles,
*  who grew up throwing left hooks,
*  who grew up slipping punches.
*  Yes, they're both homo sapiens.
*  They're both humans,
*  but you're talking about two different animals.
*  When you're talking about the person
*  that got into in their 20s and 30s,
*  versus the person that started off young,
*  you're talking about two different nervous systems.
*  If we were to look at their brains
*  under magnetic resonance imaging,
*  you'd see a lot of things that are similar.
*  The breathing centers,
*  the stuff that controls the heart rate.
*  Everything is mostly in the same place,
*  but I'd be willing to bet everything
*  that you look at Ryan Garcia's brain
*  and you go, that left hook,
*  if you were able to throw the left hook in the thing,
*  you see it light up,
*  you'd be like, wow, either more efficient,
*  maybe more space allocated to it,
*  maybe less space,
*  but the speed of transmission is just faster.
*  You're talking about a different nervous system,
*  which is just a different way of saying a different person,
*  but it's more meaningful in my view,
*  because what you're talking about
*  is cars with extra cylinders.
*  You're talking about a race between two different vehicles.
*  And so I think if somebody is very educated
*  in the fight game or is educated in any domain,
*  they're able to see that difference
*  and give people really good advice.
*  Whereas with the person themselves, they can't see that.
*  It's like, well, he looked the same.
*  He trains, I train, I train harder, I'm driven.
*  It's like, no, it's not the same.
*  And I think that's why to me,
*  something like a Cole Hawker win over a world record holder
*  is impressed as is the other stuff we were just watching,
*  incredibly impressive because you say,
*  well, he's in fifth position and he's got a shorter stride
*  and the other guy's got all this world record stuff
*  under his belt and he's done great as well.
*  I think he won the 5,000,
*  Inger Britson won the 5,000.
*  But Cole just like pulls something out.
*  Like they're very close in terms of their abilities.
*  They're roughly the same species, right?
*  In the context that we're talking about.
*  And then somehow through sheer will is able to out-kick him.
*  Sheer will, numbers, there's a lot of things going on.
*  Like what kind of conditioning he went through
*  as opposed to the other guy, like what edge he got.
*  And he's from Kentucky.
*  I've never been to, I've been to Louisville once,
*  but someone told me, I don't know if this is true or not,
*  but they're more, if you looked at the number of medals
*  from people from Kentucky,
*  it's almost like in a complete country.
*  Really?
*  I don't know what's going on in Kentucky.
*  Was there a great program there or something?
*  No, not just in track and field,
*  like across the summer Olympics.
*  If you look at the number of like American
*  versus Chinese medals, it's like tears out.
*  But then you go like Kentucky was a pretty good
*  quote unquote country.
*  Well, wasn't Muhammad Ali from Louisville?
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There you go.
*  There's something about people from Kentucky
*  are doing very well in the Olympics.
*  How are they in neuroscience?
*  I have a friend who just retired as chair
*  of the neurobiology department.
*  It's actually neuroanatomy.
*  There my friend, Bill Guido at University of Louisville.
*  Isn't it unfortunate though,
*  that like Kentucky's not associated
*  with intellectual prowess?
*  Not so much, but it's a great department.
*  You're trying to be defensive.
*  No, no, no, Bill Guido is a great,
*  he ran a great department there.
*  I'm sure someone else has taken over.
*  Great chicken, great fried chicken.
*  Maureen McCall does great vision research there.
*  So I, one of the great things about being a scientist was,
*  you know, my lab now is run at a much smaller scale and,
*  you know, but for years I just traveled the country,
*  these places I would never think to go to, right?
*  I had a great Argentine meal in Louisville.
*  I went to St. Louis.
*  I had one of the best meals of my life.
*  I don't think I'd ever go to St. Louis,
*  but I was visiting WashU, you know?
*  And then there are certain cities
*  that you hear terrible things about and they're true.
*  One of the greatest school players
*  in the history of the world came from Paducah, Kentucky.
*  Guy's name was Buddy Hall, the rifleman.
*  Like to this day, one of the all time grades.
*  And great horses.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, great horses.
*  Yeah, great horses.
*  Like I've been learning more about horses
*  because it's like dog selection and horse selection
*  is that, I mean, the genetic breeding
*  and the selection of horses for particular traits,
*  like this whole warm blood thing.
*  I don't know much about it, not enough to comment on it,
*  but these people have been around horses their whole lives.
*  A stud horse is worth millions of dollars, right?
*  And they know that that full, that's the one.
*  And they put tons of money on it.
*  Like there you have this unconscious genius
*  based on all this life experience.
*  Right, so it's almost like they're selecting the same way.
*  Like someone, if you wanted to build a Floyd Mayweather,
*  you would select, great father was a great boxer,
*  uncle's a great boxer, boxing's the family,
*  starts up young, he's got great genetics, the whole deal.
*  Or the Williams sisters, like that movie,
*  the King James movie.
*  Or Tiger Woods.
*  Yeah, or Tiger Woods.
*  Or the kids that I grew up with skateboarding,
*  like there's this kid, Guy Mariano,
*  I knew him when he was a little kid, he would waddle.
*  The board felt like looked bigger than him.
*  And now grown up, he's so good.
*  He's kind of in my generation,
*  so he's kind of like in the late forties thing.
*  He still just kills.
*  Cause he developed his body.
*  He grew up with it.
*  Went through all the trials and tribulations,
*  and this has been public.
*  Had his issues, then got sober and came back to skateboarding
*  and just skateboarded the year for thrash,
*  which is a huge deal.
*  You just see like the young Danny Way.
*  Tony Hawk grew up skateboarding.
*  His body, his nervous system is skateboarding.
*  And I love this aspect to people in sport,
*  cause we see it.
*  But I think, I remember listening to like,
*  and hearing conversations like this and thinking,
*  yeah, but like, if you're not into that, where is it?
*  And this is where, man,
*  I just keep thinking about all the time, but forgive me.
*  Rick has always said,
*  the key to being really great at something
*  is to just be you.
*  And I'm like, that sounds like about as mystical
*  wrapped in a riddle as it possibly be.
*  I can hear it in his voice when he said it.
*  But what he's saying is, what he's saying,
*  and I finally got it.
*  It's like, what are the things
*  that really pull that energy out of you?
*  What did that when you were young?
*  And if you're fortunate enough to get into something young,
*  that's a beautiful thing.
*  And Rick's superpower is his ability to get close to things,
*  people, music, et cetera, and feel it.
*  He can feel that thing.
*  And he encourages them to do more of that thing
*  as opposed to the thing they think they should do.
*  And then what's also remarkable about him
*  is he's able to disengage and just be Rick again.
*  Like he has this like empathy,
*  but it doesn't like take him over.
*  It's so wild, the guy that grew up in music
*  and did all the things he did for music,
*  he's never had a sip of alcohol or done a drug.
*  How many people who hang around musicians
*  pull that off?
*  Well, he's just a fascinating guy, period.
*  But I think what he's locked onto
*  is getting out of your own way.
*  And there's a lot of self chatter that comes in
*  whenever you're creating something,
*  where instead of engaging with the idea,
*  you're thinking about how can I make this better for me?
*  What would people like more?
*  What would get a better response?
*  And you lose the magic.
*  The magic is in the individual thought.
*  100%.
*  All right, so I go over there to spend time with him.
*  He's out of the US right now.
*  And it was the weirdest visit ever.
*  I go over to visit Rick and we'd tread water in the morning
*  and we'd listen to this podcast,
*  a history of a hundred songs,
*  a hundred rock and roll songs by Andrew Hickey.
*  It's sort of like Cuberman Lab podcast, but rock and roll.
*  Like super nerdy, long, drawn out.
*  There are a few podcasts like that,
*  like Founders Podcasts, I love that one.
*  Mine is like super nerdy, right?
*  About a given topic.
*  So we would do that and then we would just like sit around.
*  And I'm like, what are you gonna do?
*  He's like, well, let's just like sit.
*  And we would just sit with eyes closed.
*  And I was like, all right.
*  And we have lunch and then he was like,
*  let's just sit.
*  And then at one point I'm like, Rick, what are we doing?
*  And he's like, well, when you keep your body still
*  and your mind is really active, amazing ideas come forward.
*  And that's when I was like, oh my goodness.
*  Cause my first guest on my podcast
*  was a guy named Carl Dysroth.
*  He's the world's best bioengineer.
*  He's a psychiatrist.
*  He reads five kids, he's a phenom.
*  He'll probably win a Nobel Prize.
*  And he told me his practice of coming up with ideas
*  is after his kids are asleep at night,
*  sits down and he keeps his body completely still
*  and he forces himself to think in complete sentences,
*  keep his mind super active.
*  And I was like, wow.
*  And it turns out that if you look historically,
*  a number of scientists have talked about this,
*  a number of creatives have talked about this.
*  And then I don't have any studies to support this,
*  but then I realized what is the state of our brain
*  or time when the brain is very active
*  and our body is still and our mind is coming up
*  with all sorts of ideas, it's rapid eye movement sleep.
*  We're paralyzed during rapid eye movement sleep.
*  We have sleep atonia.
*  And everybody knows based on dream studies
*  and studies of creativity
*  that during rapid eye movement sleep is two things happen.
*  There's a removal of some of the emotional load
*  of previous days experiences,
*  which is why rapid eye movement sleep is so critical
*  for emotion regulation afterwards
*  and for the regulating depression and things like that.
*  But also we come up with new configurations.
*  And so Carl Deisseroth, Einstein, there are reports of this,
*  of him walking and then closing his eyes and stopping
*  and describing his mind moving forward
*  while his body was still, very kind of subjective.
*  Rick has this practice.
*  And I thought to myself, like, wow.
*  So I've started trying to do a sort of meditation
*  where I forced myself to be very bodily still
*  with my mind very active.
*  I can't, you know, I just started this.
*  Kind of interesting in light of creativity.
*  But the other thing,
*  and this goes to what you were saying before,
*  you know, Rick came up through punk rock,
*  punk rock and hip hop, right?
*  And I love punk rock music, grew up on it.
*  That era in their eighties, punk rock in New York is amazing.
*  But the whole thing like Beastie Boys,
*  he was close with the Ramones, Joe Strummer, all this,
*  and then hip hop.
*  What he understands, and I can't speak for him,
*  but what he understands is that there's this energy
*  in an early field, let's say of music,
*  where they're not thinking about making money doing it.
*  Like NWA, those guys were just being themselves
*  when they were making music, right?
*  I watched that movie, The Defiant Ones,
*  about Dre and I think it's Jimmy Iovine about beats.
*  But it's really about the energy of early hip hop.
*  And then they talk about Eminem and a bunch of other things.
*  Or you watch, Rick and I at night,
*  we'd watch Ramones documentaries or Clash documentaries.
*  And it's like, it's the energy of something that's new
*  where people are just being themselves,
*  and they're not thinking about making a ton of money
*  on a record.
*  A really great producer comes in and captures that energy
*  and rolls it forward.
*  And usually what ends up happening is then
*  the general public falls in love with it.
*  And then a bunch of things happen to those people.
*  And then whatever dysfunction exists in their world
*  gets amplified, and then we hear about it.
*  There's kind of a consistent theme over and over.
*  But it's like, and then one of the things that came up
*  when I was visiting Rick is I was like,
*  I feel like I came up through skateboarding,
*  punk rock music, I'm not a musician,
*  that incredible energy, I don't know much about hip hop.
*  I was like, science had that
*  when I first got into neuroscience.
*  No one talked about neuroscience,
*  it didn't even have a name.
*  We're just like brain explorers, cutting up brains,
*  figuring out what to do,
*  trying to figure out what these structures did
*  and all this stuff.
*  And then podcasting.
*  It's like, I really feel like the podcasters,
*  at least some of us, right?
*  It's like punk rock, it's like hip hop,
*  because we're not thinking about,
*  I wasn't just sit down and start my podcast,
*  I'm gonna start the Cumberman Lab podcast.
*  I was like, I've just got all this stuff in me
*  that I wanna tell people,
*  because I think it's super cool.
*  And a lot of it I think might also be really useful to them.
*  So when Rick, or Lex is just being Lex,
*  and Chris Williamson is just being Chris Williamson,
*  or Whitney Cummings is just being Whitney Cummings.
*  So when a podcast works,
*  I think it's because you're just being you.
*  And it seems so obvious, it's kind of almost trite,
*  but Rick is like, exactly.
*  And the biggest mistake is to take the feedback,
*  the comments, whatever, the hit pieces, whatever,
*  and to change who you are.
*  Now, there is sometimes useful information
*  that comes back to us in ways we could do better in life,
*  and certainly I am doing that.
*  But the point is, at its essence,
*  it's like the thing that makes podcasting beautiful to me
*  is that I think we're right now,
*  thanks in large part to you
*  and some of the other early entrants,
*  guys that paved the way,
*  is that it's a real thing.
*  It's a real discussion.
*  Like there's no script,
*  we didn't talk about what we're gonna talk about before.
*  Whereas when you go out there
*  and you see these like highly overproduced
*  or like media infused podcasts,
*  like it's not like real.
*  It's not real, it's like got an angle,
*  they have a story they wanna tell.
*  It's not independent anymore, it became produced.
*  Right, and let's be real honest,
*  if you look, you are consistently,
*  this podcast is consistently miles and miles
*  ahead of everybody else
*  in terms of the amount of consumption of it.
*  Why?
*  Because it's a place where people immediately
*  and consistently go, oh, it's like Joe's just being Joe.
*  It's just like a real thing.
*  And when I say a real thing, this is what Rick means,
*  like people just being themselves,
*  which like your loves, the things that bother you.
*  Like, and so I think that podcasting to me,
*  it's like skateboarding, it's like punk rock,
*  it's like hip hop, it's like a sport, it's like an art.
*  Like if you watch the movie, one of my favorite movies,
*  the Basquiat movie, right, with Benicio Del Toro
*  and Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walker and David Bowie.
*  Like, why was he so amazing?
*  Is because Jean-Michel Basquiat was just being himself
*  until the fame got to him, an article got written
*  about how he was Warhol's lap dog, they called him
*  or something like that.
*  And you can see him obsessing about it.
*  And there's this amazing riff.
*  If people haven't seen it, they should just look up
*  on YouTube, like how long does it take to get famous
*  from the movie Basquiat?
*  And it's Benicio Del Toro who plays the young Vincent Gallo
*  telling him, here's what happens when you get famous.
*  And it's an amazing clip because it explains the arc
*  of fame and people becoming famous for being themselves
*  and then doing the things that they think they should do
*  to stay popular and it destroys the whole thing.
*  And so Rick's message is, like Rick's talent is
*  to like feel real energy.
*  He can tell what's real and what's fake.
*  That's why he likes wrestling.
*  He knows it's fake.
*  And then feel that and encourage somebody to do more
*  of that, less of other stuff.
*  He's a creativity guru.
*  He's a creativity guru.
*  Then step back.
*  But the message he just keeps saying,
*  and most of our conversations end with him just saying like,
*  yeah, man, just continue to be you.
*  You, curious, adventure, whatever makes Andrew Andrew.
*  I know what those things are.
*  It's not about me.
*  This is really about, hopefully, like people hear it.
*  Like Rick is saying in that book and in all his messages,
*  like we all have some little spark or gift
*  or genetic bias towards something.
*  And if you feed that, like, and it's a benevolent thing,
*  you become that, it's like, it stays real.
*  The moment-
*  Well, you also show a path to other people, right?
*  When you can actually just be yourself,
*  people realize, maybe I can be myself too.
*  Right.
*  You know, like, and it resonates.
*  And people love that.
*  It resonates. And people love that.
*  Like, again, I don't know hip hop that well,
*  but like, you don't have to see Eminem very many times
*  or watch Eight Mile more than a couple of times
*  or listen to his music and understand,
*  like, there's an energy there.
*  It's not manufactured.
*  That's him.
*  People love that.
*  They love authenticity.
*  That's why they love old dirty bastard.
*  You know who that guy was?
*  Yeah.
*  It's me.
*  Well, like, I'm a huge Joe Strummer fan.
*  And I remember asking Rick, I was like,
*  hey, like, what do you think it was about Strummer?
*  The Clash roamed around for like five years.
*  He was like, come and gone, right?
*  And he said, very Rick, he goes,
*  you know, there's something about Joe
*  where everything he said,
*  he brought his entire life experience to that.
*  And I'm like, well, that's about as mystical as it gets.
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  And he's like, he just was purely himself that day
*  with no concern about how you would perceive him.
*  He wasn't trying to impress you or look punk
*  or not look punk.
*  He just, you know, like-
*  He just was.
*  Strummer fell in love with hip hop.
*  He'd bring out hip hop artists and the punks would boo,
*  which is when he realized punks aren't even punk.
*  You know, like, like they're there.
*  And so there's something so beautiful
*  about the energy of something really pure.
*  Like a Ryan Garcia left hook.
*  It's this, or early BC boys, right?
*  Or later BC, whatever, or a podcast.
*  And my work now is so much about like you said,
*  like don't read the comments, shut out the noise.
*  You know, like Lex wants to go into the darkness
*  and the light.
*  He like wants it.
*  He needs it.
*  Yeah, but that's always why he's down the dumps too.
*  Always telling him,
*  you're taking in too much negativity, bro.
*  I know, but I feel like if he didn't do that,
*  it would be as weird as him not wearing that suit.
*  Maybe, maybe.
*  If he didn't drink, he wouldn't be Mike, you know?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe Mike shouldn't be drinking every day.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like-
*  They're destructive aspects.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't go too far, right?
*  Like there's a great quote in the Oliver Sacks book.
*  They said, he said he had a teacher that said,
*  Oliver will go far provided he does not go too far.
*  And I saw that, I read that right about the point
*  that I recently saw the documentary,
*  Road Runner about Bourdain.
*  And I actually had a chance to sit down
*  and talk to Morgan Neville who made that movie.
*  And I didn't know much about him,
*  but like what I saw there was just like an adventure,
*  like a super curious person, an adventure,
*  and a punk rocker.
*  Like he was from that era of like Ramones.
*  Like it was like, and it was just a spectacular,
*  like I don't know why I didn't know more about him.
*  I should have, cause we have, there's kind of overlap
*  in interest sets around like the, you know,
*  New York punk rock that era that I've always been fascinated
*  by a few years behind there.
*  But I was like, wow, like I just saw like a con,
*  like genuine curiosity in people and things.
*  And then I realized like the food part
*  was kind of incidental.
*  It was like the person, it was just being him.
*  And that's why I think so many people loved him
*  is because he was just being him.
*  And I don't know any more about it,
*  but like, I feel like people just being themselves
*  is like the ultimate in personal development.
*  Yeah, he was also brilliant as a writer
*  and he would write all of his own narratives.
*  All the narration was all his writing
*  and he was just so good at it.
*  So good at expressing his joy for different cultures
*  and trying out their cuisine and what he admired
*  about them as human beings and about their spirit.
*  He loved people.
*  He loved people, he loved being around people.
*  He did not love being famous though, man.
*  That guy got fucked up by fame.
*  He did not like it.
*  It was very uncomfortable.
*  And that thing that you were talking about,
*  Basquiat experienced, I think everybody experiences.
*  You get, there's a temptation towards audience capture.
*  There's a desire to appease those
*  and please those who love you.
*  Maybe at the expense of your own self-esteem
*  and your own perspective,
*  because you see things through others' eyes
*  and how they perceive you to be
*  rather than who you actually are.
*  And you're so aware and so painfully self-aware
*  that you lose your ability to just be yourself,
*  what Rick's talking about, just to be you.
*  And that happens to most people
*  because it is a complicated drug,
*  which is why it's a terrible drug to give to young people.
*  Fame is a terrible drug to give to young people.
*  And one of the ways that I mitigate all this stuff
*  is through voluntary adversity,
*  voluntary physical adversity,
*  and then mental adversity, doing difficult things.
*  And that the more difficult things that I do,
*  the easier this weird state that I find myself in is.
*  And I think one of the reasons
*  why I'm so comfortable with it,
*  because I'm uncomfortable all the fucking time.
*  I'm voluntarily uncomfortable most of the day.
*  So regular uncomfortable, it's like, yeah, whatever.
*  It's not 196 degrees for 25 minutes.
*  I did that this morning before I got here.
*  That shit's hard, that's really hard.
*  That's like, you're gonna die hard.
*  You're gonna die hard is so much harder than,
*  oh, somebody doesn't like me.
*  Oh, somebody took my clip and took it out of context.
*  Because you're gonna die if heat is a real thing.
*  It's real.
*  This is what Rick says, nature is a truth.
*  Like, if you heat up too much too long, you can die.
*  And you're playing with that a little bit.
*  And it's hard and you do it correctly and you're good.
*  And cardio is really important for that.
*  Cardio is one of the very best things
*  for alleviating anxiety.
*  And I know there's a lot of studies
*  that have been done on weightlifting
*  and about strength resistance training
*  and alleviating anxiety.
*  And I think that's a fact.
*  I think that's true as well.
*  But there's something about I might die cardio.
*  I might die cardio is a different kind of cardio.
*  It's like, if you can swim to the point where,
*  you do laps in the pool,
*  and you do laps in the pool where you're like,
*  I don't know if I'm gonna make it
*  to the end of that fucking pool.
*  And when you do get out of that pool,
*  regular life is way easier.
*  Period, full stop, no discussion.
*  I think when people are talking about cardio,
*  they're engaging in maybe zone two type cardio.
*  Which is a walk.
*  Which is very good for you.
*  Very good for you by the way.
*  I do zone two cardio.
*  I will get on the assault bike and not go very fast.
*  And do 50 minutes and watch television.
*  I will do that.
*  But I also do Tabata sprints on that motherfucker
*  where I do 20 minutes sprinting, 10 seconds rest.
*  Excuse me, 20 seconds sprinting,
*  10 second rest, 20 seconds sprinting.
*  And I do that in sets of four,
*  four, eight reps.
*  So eight reps, four times.
*  It's only like 20 minutes.
*  I do something similar.
*  I do a fucking horrendous.
*  I like to walk or hike.
*  I use one of these vests.
*  I don't have any relationship to them.
*  But a Morpho makes these ones that are really close
*  to the body.
*  And so I use that.
*  Cause you can really move easily in that.
*  I don't like a heavily loaded military vest.
*  It doesn't feel right to me.
*  And if I load from the back like a rock,
*  I feel pitched forward.
*  So I like how smooth goes a Morpho.
*  Yeah, nice smooth feel.
*  And then I'll walk far that way.
*  But then I'll do the same thing.
*  Except I do a little different.
*  I'll go 10 second sprint, 20 second rest.
*  Do that eight times.
*  That's my Friday morning HIIT workout.
*  And I feel like I want to die by the last one.
*  But I think that I have an observation
*  that's not backed by any formal science.
*  I'd like your thoughts on it.
*  I've known a lot of people who are kind of compulsive,
*  anxious, or even outright addicts
*  who then get really into running
*  or any kind of cardio long distance endurance type sport.
*  And they seem to, again, not a scientific study.
*  They seem to get and stay sober.
*  Whereas I find that while weight lifting is really healthy
*  and I really enjoy it,
*  I've observed that it can create a kind of like tension
*  in the body that doesn't like release completely.
*  Maybe even builds energy into the nervous system,
*  so to speak.
*  And I do know a number of people
*  who have had challenges with drugs and alcohol.
*  I'm grateful that I haven't had those challenges,
*  but have challenges with drugs and alcohol.
*  And they've gone the way of just weightlifting.
*  And they've been like multiple relapsers.
*  Now that's not a knock against weightlifting.
*  I think people should do resistance training and cardio.
*  But it is kind of remarkable
*  that people that do a lot of cardio
*  seem to successfully beat their addictions.
*  And maybe it's just the time involved, who knows?
*  It's a lot of time involved.
*  It's also overwhelming.
*  So it takes over your mind, your body.
*  I think if you're doing a marathon,
*  you're grinding for hours.
*  You're doing three hours if you're really fast.
*  What's the longest distance
*  you've ever run in a single bout?
*  I don't really run.
*  So the longest distance I've ever run is only a few miles.
*  I did a 5K once.
*  My friend, well, Cam Haines, you know Cam.
*  Cam had a 5K once in Vegas.
*  And I had zero training.
*  I didn't run at all.
*  And I did, I was like, wow, this is hard.
*  And at the end of it, I was like,
*  that's a lot harder than I thought.
*  I thought I was in pretty good shape.
*  I'd be able to run, what is it, three point something miles?
*  Yeah, he's a sicko.
*  He's got a broken foot right now.
*  And he's still running on it.
*  And-
*  Yeah, he's gotta get surgery,
*  but he can't have surgery right now
*  because he has a L-conic season coming up.
*  He was on his way to Alaska when I last texted him.
*  He sent me some meat,
*  which I'm very grateful for, it's delicious.
*  He told me that, I said, you know,
*  what's the pain level in that foot?
*  Cause he showed the x-ray, it's still very broken.
*  And I said, you know, 10 out of 10 being max pain,
*  like excruciating, cannot stand it.
*  He was like, I don't know, maybe a four or five.
*  But he's running.
*  He was like, yeah.
*  He came and stayed recently.
*  He stayed at my house a few times
*  and I've set up some archery in the backyard.
*  And I like, he can use my sauna, cold plunge.
*  I love it when people just spontaneously come and stay,
*  Lex has come and stayed.
*  And I wake up and there's literally,
*  we did a post about it,
*  but literally how it happened was I woke up in the morning,
*  hadn't yet started work.
*  So that was added later to the post.
*  And Cam Haines is on my roof, shooting arrows at my targets,
*  which he's moved beyond the fence line.
*  And so the neighbors are like, who's this guy?
*  This is Los Angeles, right?
*  You know, so he's a wild man.
*  I love him.
*  Hitting bull's eyes the whole way through just to rub it in.
*  It's just bizarre that he's running on that foot.
*  He knows he's going to have to get it fixed.
*  But if they get it fixed,
*  he's probably going to have to be off of it
*  for like six weeks or something.
*  I know.
*  And I keep trying to get him to do some of the,
*  what I know to be very useful things like BPC 157, et cetera,
*  which yes, there isn't any clinical data for it.
*  It's all animal data.
*  But so many people report feeling better.
*  It's very hard to get now.
*  But he's got a gap in that broken foot.
*  He needs to mend that thing.
*  Yeah, they need to put some screws in that bitch.
*  But he would run on stomps.
*  Guys like him and Goggins will run on stomps.
*  Goggins got another knee surgery recently.
*  Yeah, he's had a, I mean, he's bone on bone
*  and he's essentially getting surgeries to shape his bone.
*  So his bone on bone is flatter
*  because you know, when you have bone on bone,
*  it distorts and grows weird.
*  So what does he do?
*  Does he stop?
*  Does he get a fake knee?
*  Nope.
*  He gets it cut flat and pull.
*  He gets a wedge cut in the bone and shifts it down.
*  So it's flat.
*  So bone on bone,
*  at least it has the correct geometry.
*  Like what?
*  He's a phenom.
*  Well, there's a guy where in his,
*  whatever it was, late 20s, took a look at his childhood
*  and was like, well, I wasn't, you know, being,
*  you know, my nervous system shaped to be a great athlete
*  or a Navy SEAL, et cetera,
*  looked at everything he had become.
*  And he basically said a big, hard no.
*  He's like, whatever it was that happened before then,
*  he was going to shape his nervous system
*  by putting in endless hours.
*  So-
*  Yeah, in his 20s, fat.
*  In his 20s, right.
*  So it runs counter to everything
*  that we talked about earlier,
*  which is that one has to start early,
*  but he's making up the time and then some, you know,
*  I saw a poster where he was,
*  where he couldn't move his legs for whatever reason.
*  Maybe he just had surgery.
*  So he was running on his hands on the treadmill.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, with his feet position,
*  kind of like plank position.
*  Yeah, he's a ridiculous person.
*  It's amazing.
*  Super inspiring.
*  He's like a noun and a verb, you know, and an adjective.
*  I just wish that there was stem cell technology
*  and regenerative technology available now
*  to help his joints stay healthy.
*  Because the problem is that will, that mind,
*  that power is eventually going to break down his body
*  and mechanically it's not going to work anymore.
*  Titanium is pretty good.
*  This is what the neurosurgeons understand.
*  Like, you know, you take out a little flap of skull,
*  you replace it with titanium.
*  It's a lot stronger.
*  You know, I mean-
*  You mean titanium knees?
*  Is that what you're suggesting?
*  Yeah, or other bio materials, right?
*  They're close.
*  They're real close.
*  There's been some studies recently that regenerate cartilage,
*  and so I think they're real close.
*  I think if you could just hang in there
*  for a few more years,
*  they're probably going to be able to fix things.
*  Yeah, exosomes are exciting.
*  BPC 157, while only animal data, it's very clear,
*  you know, has the propensity to encourage fibroblasts,
*  which is cells that, you know, make up things like tendon
*  and cartilage, et cetera, and can really repair tissues.
*  I mean, you know, and I certainly have experienced,
*  it can help repair things.
*  Yeah, it's legit.
*  It's legit, and unfortunately the FDA
*  is trying to get rid of it.
*  There's a lot of things that are really good for you
*  that unfortunately are not regulated correctly.
*  Yeah.
*  It sucks.
*  Well, my wish, I mean, I have no plans to go to Washington,
*  but my wish is that things like BPC 157,
*  some very interesting, I would say not cutting edge,
*  but even further out, like bleeding edge,
*  things like pinealin, which can help with regeneration
*  of the pinealocytes are incredible for sleep potentially.
*  Like we need these things explored,
*  and everyone for a while was like, peptides.
*  Oh, it sounds really kind of gray market weird,
*  and it can be, but let's face it, GLP-1 agonists,
*  Osanthic Monjaro.
*  That's a peptide that existed for years
*  in the fitness and bodybuilding industry.
*  Now it's probably approaching
*  a trillion dollar industry someday.
*  That has a tremendous windfall
*  in terms of the amount of money you can generate from it.
*  BPC 157 can be made by virtually any laboratory,
*  and it's probably going to cut back on orthopedic surgeries.
*  And that's the gross reality of a lot of this stuff.
*  A lot of this stuff is going to cost companies money
*  because people won't be taking pain medication,
*  they won't be taking anti-inflammatory medication,
*  they won't be getting as many surgeries,
*  and that's where it gets fucked up.
*  Because the healthcare system,
*  the business of healthcare is really set up
*  not looking at people as like, what's the best way
*  and the most efficient way and the most cost-effective way
*  in terms of for the actual patient to treat them.
*  No, it's how do I make the most money from this person?
*  Well, we did an episode on back health
*  and strengthening the back and back pain.
*  We had Stu McGill on and it was wild.
*  I've never received emails and stuff like that.
*  Like half of the people or more saying,
*  the McGill big three helped me so much,
*  stabilized my back.
*  He's got his three movements.
*  You can look it up on YouTube, they're easy to find there.
*  But it's all about, and he's in great shape
*  in his late 60s, incredible, incredible shape.
*  Chops Wood, he's up in Canada.
*  So he basically is giving behavioral tools
*  to stabilize and strengthen the spine
*  and deal with back pain.
*  And then the other half, we're like, what is this?
*  You can't treat back pain as a pseudo science.
*  But then everyone telling me how much benefit they got
*  out of McGill's big three.
*  And then the war among the physios, like the physios,
*  that's an ugly field, I'll tell you.
*  And I asked someone, why is this field
*  of exercise physiology so brutal?
*  I asked Andy Galpin.
*  And it turns out it's because it's very hard
*  to get a lot of clients.
*  And the moment that somebody comes out with knowledge
*  that's very useful for a lot of people,
*  they're potentially taking away their livelihood.
*  To say nothing of the pain treatment world,
*  we had a guy on our podcast named Sean Mackey,
*  he's an MD, PhD, runs our pain clinic at Stanford.
*  And he talks about the biopsychosocial model of pain.
*  And he's very open-minded.
*  Meds work in some cases.
*  So does your emotional or cognitive interpretation
*  of the pain, what does it mean?
*  So do things like meditation.
*  Like he's basically trying to incorporate
*  all these different things.
*  He's very holistic, for lack of a better word.
*  But if you look at most pain docs,
*  they're not that evolved.
*  They're just like, okay, this is what you use.
*  It might be addictive, it might not be addictive.
*  But they're not ever talking about strengthening
*  the systems that gave away in the first place.
*  So I totally agree with you.
*  Like there is no replacement for self-care.
*  There's just no replacement.
*  No pill, no potion, no injection, no nothing.
*  There are things that can help,
*  but there's nothing that can replace behaviors.
*  Because our nervous system was evolved for these behaviors.
*  Yeah, listen, man,
*  it's always a fascinating conversation with you.
*  I appreciate you very much.
*  I'm really glad you have your own podcast
*  and that it's so popular.
*  And I love it.
*  I listen to it all the time.
*  Thank you.
*  And you put out a lot of great information, man.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  Well, thank you.
*  I really appreciate you.
*  You've been a great friend to me
*  and a great source of support
*  through a bunch of different aspects of podcasting
*  and supporting the discussions about health and exercise
*  and forcing me to make my cold plunge a little colder,
*  have me sniff smelling salt, all of it.
*  I might be wrong about the cold.
*  I don't know.
*  No, but really right back at you.
*  There are very few places in the world
*  where you can have a real discussion about real things
*  from all the angles
*  and know that the person sitting across from you
*  is being truly open-minded about it.
*  So really appreciate you.
*  My pleasure.
*  I appreciate you too.
*  All right, bye everybody.
