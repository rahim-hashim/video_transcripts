# JRE MMA Show #141 with Mike Perry
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening? Good to see you brother. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=10.0s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=15.0s)]
*  You want some coffee? Drink coffee? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=16.0s)]
*  Sure, yeah. Sure, I'll take some. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=18.0s)]
*  Alright. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=20.0s)]
*  Dude, you have had a fascinating renaissance. Cheers, sir. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=21.0s)]
*  Cheers, brother. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=25.0s)]
*  This bare knuckle boxing thing has been fascinating to watch, man, because it's like someone designed the perfect sport for you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=26.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=34.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=35.0s)]
*  Like you are particularly well suited for that. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=36.0s)]
*  I feel like it was made for me. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=41.0s)]
*  And I find it so fascinating because there's a certain, and I really wanted to ask you about this, because there's a certain something that applies to bare knuckle boxing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=42.0s)]
*  There's a danger and there's a wildness of it that even some very great fighters, they get to a certain, they're in there and they're like, I don't like this. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=53.0s)]
*  They're too used to gloves. They're too used to whatever they're used to. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=62.0s)]
*  They don't want that experience once they find it, once they're in there. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=66.0s)]
*  But you seem to thrive on it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=70.0s)]
*  You know, it's just a real fight to me. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=72.0s)]
*  Even though I'm not a fighter, I'm a fighter. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=75.0s)]
*  I love boxing so much though. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=78.0s)]
*  It's my forte. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=80.0s)]
*  It's like what I'm good at because I'm cool to take a punch, get hit. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=82.0s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=87.0s)]
*  I'll take a hit to land a better one on you. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=88.0s)]
*  And in bare knuckle, I mean, there's a lot of opportunity to fight. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=91.0s)]
*  I mean, I did fight Julian Lane who had experience in it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=98.0s)]
*  Yeah, he had nine fights in it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=103.0s)]
*  When we fought and then I fought two guys who hadn't done it yet. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=104.0s)]
*  So, you know, but it's just like, like, let's talk about those two guys. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=108.0s)]
*  Like, first of all, I'm not a fighter. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=114.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=116.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=117.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=118.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=119.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=120.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=121.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=123.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=124.0s)]
*  I'm a fighter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=125.0s)]
*  Like, let's talk about those two guys. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=126.0s)]
*  Like, first of all, Michael Venom Page, that guy is super talented. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=131.0s)]
*  I mean, he's extraordinary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=132.0s)]
*  When you watch him fight in MMA, and he's a guy that I kind of predicted one day. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=133.0s)]
*  I was like the one skill that you don't see a lot of in MMA is this crazy blitz point [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=138.0s)]
*  fighting style because those guys can cover crazy distances. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=145.0s)]
*  Those are really good point fighters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=149.0s)]
*  And he was a really good point fighter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=151.0s)]
*  And he was the first guy that kind of showed how that style could apply in MMA. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=153.0s)]
*  He's so elusive and so hard to hit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=161.0s)]
*  And, you know, you just put it on him. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=164.0s)]
*  Well, it was different, you know. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=167.0s)]
*  It was boxing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=170.0s)]
*  I mean, he beat a couple guys boxing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=174.0s)]
*  But it's, I mean, because he's good MMA. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=175.0s)]
*  He's good MMA. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=178.0s)]
*  After I beat him, I thought, you know, maybe they'll try to make that fight happen in MMA [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=179.0s)]
*  now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=184.0s)]
*  But I do feel like I would overpower him grappling wise. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=185.0s)]
*  But his legs are very dangerous. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=189.0s)]
*  I mean, that last guy, he fought, he kicked him in the leg and it was over. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's very dangerous. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=194.0s)]
*  That knockout of Cyborg was fucking crazy. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=196.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=199.0s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=200.0s)]
*  The Pokemon ball. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=202.0s)]
*  I mean, he caved his forehead in. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=203.0s)]
*  With his legs. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=204.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=205.0s)]
*  His legs are dangerous. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=206.0s)]
*  It's just something to me to want, you know, I'm hungry for fights. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=207.0s)]
*  I want to fight all these motherfuckers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=209.0s)]
*  Well, I think with a guy like that, it's funny, I was watching Stylebender was on Andrew Schultz's [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=211.0s)]
*  podcast and they were talking about him boxing some days. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=216.0s)]
*  Like boxing is too limited. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=219.0s)]
*  It's too limited a fight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=221.0s)]
*  You think about a guy like him who applies this full, wild range of things, especially [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=222.0s)]
*  with Michael Venom-Page, because he's so good at closing distance and kicking you and kneeing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=228.0s)]
*  you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=233.0s)]
*  And that, the knee, the timing of that knee. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=234.0s)]
*  It's magnificent, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=236.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=237.0s)]
*  And when you take all that away and you only have these, it's a big difference. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=243.0s)]
*  It's a gigantic difference. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=244.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=245.0s)]
*  It's so interesting to me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=246.0s)]
*  But I have the same difference and I like it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=247.0s)]
*  I like it, it fits me. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=249.0s)]
*  I mean, I did boxing. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=251.0s)]
*  I had one pro boxing match. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=253.0s)]
*  I'm still 0-1 as a professional boxer. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=255.0s)]
*  But then I did that Triller thing in the triangle and I fought Michael Seals, who was 27-3 in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=258.0s)]
*  a mixed boxing match with Turtleback MMA gloves. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=265.0s)]
*  And I won. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=271.0s)]
*  I mean, I just put the pressure on him the whole time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=274.0s)]
*  What are Turtleback MMA gloves? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=276.0s)]
*  Turtleback are like the training MMA gloves. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=278.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=281.0s)]
*  But it was like while Metallica was playing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=282.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, here it is. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=284.0s)]
*  Oh, so they're like kind of big MMA gloves. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=285.0s)]
*  He was 27-3 as a professional boxer. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=288.0s)]
*  He drops me like once. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=291.0s)]
*  They counted it once he dropped me. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=295.0s)]
*  Another time I got hit in the back of the head and the ref saw it and I went down a little bit. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=297.0s)]
*  But I got right back up. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=303.0s)]
*  So what is the biggest difference about bare knuckle for you? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=304.0s)]
*  I learned though. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=309.0s)]
*  So like when I fought Julian Lane, his little head hurt my hands. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=312.0s)]
*  Because a lot of the time with boxing gloves on, your hands are like open. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=316.0s)]
*  And you try to close it at the right time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=320.0s)]
*  But you know, if you do that bare knuckle, because you know how if you're squeezing your fist, it's a little harder to move. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=323.0s)]
*  You're kind of tense. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=331.0s)]
*  But in bare knuckle, you have to learn how to move while you're tense and keep your hands closed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=333.0s)]
*  Because with gloves, you can block a shot like this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=338.0s)]
*  But in bare knuckle, you got to be closed up tight and squeezing your fist so hard so that when you hit them in the head, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=341.0s)]
*  you don't destroy your hand. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's like there's three levels of vulnerability. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=351.0s)]
*  And the level number one is like you would see a lot of the like the glory guys. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=354.0s)]
*  They keep their hands in a shell like Alistair Overeem or, you know, like Potter Hari. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=358.0s)]
*  Those guys would shell up. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=363.0s)]
*  They shell up. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=364.0s)]
*  But they have those big ass gloves. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=365.0s)]
*  And you see that when they come to MMA, some of those shots sneak through. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=367.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=370.0s)]
*  But then bare knuckle, it's another level of sneaking through. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=371.0s)]
*  It's a totally different. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=375.0s)]
*  It's a totally different. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=376.0s)]
*  It's it's really interesting to watch a really good fighter like Luke Rockhold, you know, and you. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=377.0s)]
*  And, you know, Luke Rockhold is very skillful. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=383.0s)]
*  He's a very skillful guy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=386.0s)]
*  And when you were putting it on him, I was like, this is a totally different thing. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=388.0s)]
*  And you are like uniquely suited for this totally different thing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=392.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=398.0s)]
*  It's different than regular boxing men. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=399.0s)]
*  And when remember in Paulie Malinagi fought Artem Lobov? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=400.0s)]
*  Well, Paulie, I mean, he's a scrawny dude. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=405.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=409.0s)]
*  And Lobov was just a little dog. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=410.0s)]
*  He's a dog. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=414.0s)]
*  So it was a good fight, to be honest. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=415.0s)]
*  But the jabbing and moving that Paulie did didn't work for him. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=417.0s)]
*  And Luke, I don't know. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=420.0s)]
*  You know, that's kind of what we were talking about when you brought up Luke. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=421.0s)]
*  We were talking about I was talking about the tight fist and like how bare knuckle is different. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=424.0s)]
*  And it's like I figured out how to utilize the bare knuckle. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=428.0s)]
*  I mean, I knocked his teeth out. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=434.0s)]
*  I hit him by the time I caught him. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=436.0s)]
*  And then he was like, I'm not trying to get hit like that again. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=438.0s)]
*  It was a matter of time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=441.0s)]
*  The gap was closing. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=442.0s)]
*  It takes a second. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=443.0s)]
*  He hit me, too. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=445.0s)]
*  And I told him, I bet it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=446.0s)]
*  I haven't talked to him about it or asked him because I don't I mean, you know, he lost or whatever. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=448.0s)]
*  So I don't talk to losers. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=455.0s)]
*  But I try to do what winners do, man. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=457.0s)]
*  I try to think about winners. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=459.0s)]
*  But when I hit him with that shot and he didn't want to get hit again, he had hit me. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=460.0s)]
*  I got a little knot on my face right there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=465.0s)]
*  But I took it and I bet it hurt him. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=467.0s)]
*  I bet it hurt his hand. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=469.0s)]
*  I told him before the fight, you're going to punch me in the head. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=471.0s)]
*  It's going to be the hardest thing you ever hit. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=473.0s)]
*  And then I'm going to I'm going to headbutt you in your hands and I'm going to punch you in your face and you're going to quit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=475.0s)]
*  And that's what he did. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=481.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=484.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's good stuff, man. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=485.0s)]
*  It's a different thing, man. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=486.0s)]
*  It's a different thing. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=487.0s)]
*  I think I can do it in any gloves, though, any sport. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=489.0s)]
*  I could fight in the UFC. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=491.0s)]
*  I have a mindset and I fight with these guys. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=493.0s)]
*  I do MMA. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=495.0s)]
*  I see your belt on the wall in there when I went and did the cold plunge. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=496.0s)]
*  It's like a red belt or a black belt with red stripes. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=500.0s)]
*  That's John Jock's belt. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=504.0s)]
*  That's not your belt? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=505.0s)]
*  No, no, it's John Jock Machado. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=506.0s)]
*  When he when he got his coral belt, he gave some of them out to some of his students. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=507.0s)]
*  Man, dudes like that, you know, coral belt stuff. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=512.0s)]
*  I'm going to chase back my my black belt. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=515.0s)]
*  I'm a purple belt for a stripe for years now. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=518.0s)]
*  Could have been have my brown belt. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=521.0s)]
*  I got great jujitsu. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=523.0s)]
*  I train with some of the best jujitsu practitioners. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=524.0s)]
*  I just choose to sprawl and brawl. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=527.0s)]
*  I like to punch people. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=529.0s)]
*  I think it's the best off button. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=530.0s)]
*  I enjoy it and it's exciting. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=532.0s)]
*  And it's entertainment business, right? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=534.0s)]
*  So, you know, fucking lost my. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=536.0s)]
*  There's something to be said for that for sure. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=541.0s)]
*  I mean, look, people love to watch you fight. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=543.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=545.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=546.0s)]
*  I was always a giant fan. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=547.0s)]
*  That's my point was. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=549.0s)]
*  Yeah, you had. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=551.0s)]
*  I will fight anyone anywhere. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=552.0s)]
*  I would love to. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=554.0s)]
*  Please give me opportunities. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=555.0s)]
*  I want to show and be I want to be a fucking coral belt in my own right in my own way. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=557.0s)]
*  And people know Mike Perry walks down the street. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=562.0s)]
*  It's like that's what the baddest motherfucker that ever lived, dude. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=565.0s)]
*  Mike Perry, they're going to talk about me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=569.0s)]
*  Just like they did Mike Tyson. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=572.0s)]
*  I feel like Mike Tyson. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=574.0s)]
*  I feel different. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=575.0s)]
*  I'm better. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=578.0s)]
*  What what changed in you? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=579.0s)]
*  Like how did you come into your own? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=581.0s)]
*  Because you were always a really good fighter. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=583.0s)]
*  But it seems like over the last few years, you're on a completely different. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=585.0s)]
*  I have a family. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=589.0s)]
*  I love them so much. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=590.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'm a human. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=592.0s)]
*  I fuck up. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=595.0s)]
*  I make mistakes and shit. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=596.0s)]
*  But, you know, I know I don't give up. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=597.0s)]
*  I keep going and I push and I took, you know, David Goggins type shit. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=600.0s)]
*  You know, it's like I stopped making fucking excuses and fucking was like, you know, I'm hurt all the time. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=605.0s)]
*  I'm always fucking hurt. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=613.0s)]
*  I don't care. I'm like, all right, fuck it. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=615.0s)]
*  I got to wake up every day and feel this shit. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=616.0s)]
*  You can't fucking hurt me because I'm in enough pain. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=619.0s)]
*  I take anything you got and give it back. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=624.0s)]
*  That's fighting. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=628.0s)]
*  And I got and I do it for, you know, I do it for fighting. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=629.0s)]
*  I love fighting. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=634.0s)]
*  Like, that's my shit. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=636.0s)]
*  That's even though it hurts. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=638.0s)]
*  Fuck my face up. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=640.0s)]
*  I've hate. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=641.0s)]
*  It's a love hate relationship. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=642.0s)]
*  My family can hurt my feelings, too. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=644.0s)]
*  So it's all emotional feelings. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=647.0s)]
*  And if you tell yourself just who cares, like just no one cares about your problems or anything. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=649.0s)]
*  So just handle your business. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=657.0s)]
*  When did you get into fighting? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=659.0s)]
*  When did you get into martial arts? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=661.0s)]
*  I feel like to be honest, I feel like it was September 15th, 1991, the day I was born. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=663.0s)]
*  But 11 years old, I was on YouTube doing videos, watching Mike Tyson, Roy Jones Jr. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=671.0s)]
*  Going to school, bringing gloves or fighting kids on the block in the grass, you know, with gloves on, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=679.0s)]
*  busting kids up, older kids, kids my age. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=688.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=692.0s)]
*  It's just always been a fun game. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=694.0s)]
*  I played all sports, basketball, rode my bike 20 miles all over the streets. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=696.0s)]
*  Times have changed. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=700.0s)]
*  Kids ain't out there like that no more. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=701.0s)]
*  I don't know. I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=704.0s)]
*  I probably would have stabbed the guy trying to do it though. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=706.0s)]
*  How many fights did you get in as a kid? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=709.0s)]
*  Oh man, I remember my dad always saying, I'm 100 know in these streets. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=711.0s)]
*  I fought 200 times or something. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=718.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, you didn't. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=721.0s)]
*  I do. I fight. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=723.0s)]
*  Other than the streets, I mean, just my whole life, you know, I spar every week. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=725.0s)]
*  Sometimes two or three or four times, sometimes every day. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=730.0s)]
*  And are you doing MMA sparring because you want to compete in MMA again? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=734.0s)]
*  Are you doing it because you love it? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=738.0s)]
*  I want to fight people and I want to be better than them. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=740.0s)]
*  In MMA too? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=744.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like I've had so much success with this bare-knuckle box and it's like, give me a challenge. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=746.0s)]
*  What do you think about bare-knuckle MMA? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=753.0s)]
*  Because I know, I believe Jorge Masvidal's organization does that, right? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=756.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=760.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=762.0s)]
*  I think Jorge is a bare-knuckle MMA thing. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=763.0s)]
*  What do you think about it? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=766.0s)]
*  Because like, why do we protect the knuckles of the hands when you don't protect all these other weapons? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=767.0s)]
*  You don't protect elbows, you don't protect knees or shins, which are harder. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=774.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that the one thing that's padded is the one thing you're kind of padding it because it's vulnerable. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=779.0s)]
*  Well, you figured out a way to fight really at your best without that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=785.0s)]
*  I feel like I don't want to use the glove as an excuse either though because I feel like in ways you can punch harder with the glove. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=791.0s)]
*  You can throw a bigger shot with the glove. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=797.0s)]
*  No, for sure. No argument at all. It definitely protects your hands and it's definitely safer for the fighter. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=799.0s)]
*  But is it realistic? Why is this one thing encased? Why are your hands encased? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=804.0s)]
*  Because boxing has been around for hundreds of years and that's what we did. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=810.0s)]
*  I know, because it seems barbaric to be able to hit someone with bare-knuckle. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=813.0s)]
*  But that's the real thing. That's real. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=818.0s)]
*  The knuckle thing is like this agreed-upon padding. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=822.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm looking into the business of bare-knuckle. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=826.0s)]
*  I want to do like a sand-show with a karate combat, five-second ground and pound, bare-knuckle, allow elbows. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=830.0s)]
*  Like, you know, PFL doesn't allow elbows, so that's weird. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=841.0s)]
*  Why would you make a sport where you utilize your whole body and then you're going to cut off one of the biggest weapons? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=844.0s)]
*  I've knocked people out with elbows. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=854.0s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think of Lethway? They're using headbutts and elbows. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=856.0s)]
*  Is that a name of a... [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=861.0s)]
*  It's a style of fighting. It's like Muay Thai but with like headbutts. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=863.0s)]
*  Oh wow, headbutts. You've never seen a dude do that? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=868.0s)]
*  I've been told headbutts are kind of like, um, we don't go that far. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=871.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's amazing. This cat who's the king of Lethway is this wild dude. He does headbutts in combinations. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=878.0s)]
*  Lethway is the sport? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=886.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's basically like a more brutal version of Muay Thai where they allow headbutts. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=888.0s)]
*  They do it in Myanmar. And this dude is actually from Canada. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=895.0s)]
*  I've seen him before. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=900.0s)]
*  This guy fucks everybody up. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=901.0s)]
*  He headbutts the shit out of people. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=902.0s)]
*  He fucks everybody up. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=904.0s)]
*  I don't fight him. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=905.0s)]
*  He's a killer. That would be a wild fight. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=906.0s)]
*  It would be great. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=908.0s)]
*  Yeah, but this is the thing. It's all bare knuckle but headbutts, you're allowed to do a lot of shit. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=909.0s)]
*  It looks like you can't hit the guy when he's down, but you can throw elbows and headbutts in combination and everything's bare knuckle. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=915.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know, like I was saying, I want to challenge because I mean the bare knuckle is still challenging, but I made it so easy last time. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=926.0s)]
*  Luke Rocko didn't have a chance and it seemed like I could have beaten him in MMA. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=934.0s)]
*  Do you think that, do you think there's ever a, I mean, could it ever be possible that even boxing would go to no gloves? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=939.0s)]
*  Like if people just decide they'd like bare knuckle more? [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=948.0s)]
*  Because there's this, there's this, what do you call it? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=951.0s)]
*  Deep down in the boxing, like it has its own soul and that's why it's been around for 200 years or more. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=956.0s)]
*  And you know, it's like when you have, speaking of boxing, T-Bud versus Spence coming up. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=964.0s)]
*  Amazing. What a fight. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=975.0s)]
*  I get goosebumps just thinking about that one. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=976.0s)]
*  Everything about it, Spence is Spence the same since the car accident, even though he's had fights. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=978.0s)]
*  I've seen him, you know, not paying attention in a fight with Uges. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=983.0s)]
*  Uges was hitting him because he just was like looking around in the ring. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=987.0s)]
*  And then, and these guys, you know, T-Bud 39 and 0. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=995.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=996.0s)]
*  Insane. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=997.0s)]
*  So, and he's a dog. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=998.0s)]
*  He's a dog and he's the best switch hitter since Hagler. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1000.0s)]
*  They're going to fight. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1003.0s)]
*  That dude can fight so well. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1004.0s)]
*  And they hit so hard with the gloves and their technique is so tight. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1006.0s)]
*  They can't take their gloves off. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1011.0s)]
*  The fight be over. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1015.0s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1016.0s)]
*  These 12 round fights, these guys go at it for all 12. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1017.0s)]
*  And, you know. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's a different thing. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1023.0s)]
*  It's just a totally different thing. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1025.0s)]
*  I guess you got to want a knockout or a technique, you know, whichever one the fans want the most. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1027.0s)]
*  If they like bare knuckle, I mean, they do. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1034.0s)]
*  It's just so different. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1036.0s)]
*  There's just so much you could never get away with. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1037.0s)]
*  It's exciting and it's fast paced and everything is like pushes. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1040.0s)]

*  That adds a whole nother element. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1296.0s)]
*  He'll probably break my foot and I'll have to. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1297.0s)]
*  Yeah, you don't want him. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1300.0s)]
*  Can he play with me though? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1302.0s)]
*  I'm such a grown man. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1304.0s)]
*  Like, I mean, like. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1305.0s)]
*  That's such a great way to put it. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1306.0s)]
*  I'll fight anyone, but it's not a fight. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1309.0s)]
*  It's the rules. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1313.0s)]
*  It's how they lay the rules out for you. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1314.0s)]
*  Bare Knuckle is my rule set for sure. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1316.0s)]
*  Here's the thing about slapping. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1318.0s)]
*  This is the reality. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1320.0s)]
*  If you go back and watch Boss Rootin in the pancreas days, Boss Rootin was the first guy to figure it out. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1321.0s)]
*  You're calling it a slap, but Boss Rootin is pulling his hands way back and he's palming you. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1327.0s)]
*  And he can actually hit you and not even worry about hurting his hands. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1333.0s)]
*  So he can kind of hit you harder in a lot of ways. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1337.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1339.0s)]
*  No, slaps are. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1340.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to slap in Bare Knuckle. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1341.0s)]
*  Isn't that fucked up? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1343.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1344.0s)]
*  I slapped Julian Lane a couple of times. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1345.0s)]
*  The ref was like, I'm like, damn, bro, I can't even close my hand. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1348.0s)]
*  It's like the fifth round. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1352.0s)]
*  I couldn't even close my shit. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1353.0s)]
*  I slapped him. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1354.0s)]
*  Look at the Boss Rootin was fucking. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1355.0s)]
*  See how far he's pulling his hand back? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1357.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1360.0s)]
*  Boss is great. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1361.0s)]
*  Boss is great. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1362.0s)]
*  He was an animal. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1363.0s)]
*  But he was figuring out how to really fuck people up with palm strikes. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1364.0s)]
*  So it wasn't as simple as like slapping is safer or something like that. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1368.0s)]
*  I think that was like one of the reasons why they used to be able to do it in California at one point in time. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1373.0s)]
*  You were able to do pancreas so that you could slap, but you had to have an open hand. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1378.0s)]
*  There was like a lot of those weird rules back then. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1382.0s)]
*  You know, but Boss figured out. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1385.0s)]
*  So like so combat jujitsu with just slapping, if it's getting to the ground, you could hit somebody pretty fucking hard with the palm of your hand. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1387.0s)]
*  If you're you have to be grappling. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1396.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1398.0s)]
*  Already. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1399.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1400.0s)]
*  It's not just slap from the beginning, which is kind of weird, too. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1401.0s)]
*  It's kind of weird, too. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1404.0s)]
*  Like how let me let Gordon Ryan would let me. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1405.0s)]
*  I guess I'm a slapbox is there. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1409.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1412.0s)]
*  It's try not to let him get a hold of me, man. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1414.0s)]
*  I brought you some gifts. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1417.0s)]
*  Did you? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1418.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1419.0s)]
*  I should if I could get that out of the way. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1420.0s)]
*  Nothing special, man. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1423.0s)]
*  Not crazy because you're Joe Rogan. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1424.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1426.0s)]
*  I tried to bring you something. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1427.0s)]
*  I don't very much. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1428.0s)]
*  I don't give people gifts. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1429.0s)]
*  Well, I appreciate it, man. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1430.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1432.0s)]
*  I'm glad you came in here because I've really been appreciating your fights. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1433.0s)]
*  I really have. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1437.0s)]
*  And especially the the bare knuckle once recently. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1438.0s)]
*  I'm like, God damn. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1441.0s)]
*  Give them any attention. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1443.0s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1444.0s)]
*  What you got in there, dude? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1446.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1448.0s)]
*  Everything, dude. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1449.0s)]
*  I got so much stuff here. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1451.0s)]
*  So you could just give it to me later if you want. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1452.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1461.0s)]
*  Does your contract with bare knuckle, do they let you do other kind of fights? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yes, they'll let me box. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1469.0s)]
*  They let other guys go back to MMA and stuff. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1471.0s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I'm in the fight business. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1474.0s)]
*  I'm going to I'm a hired assassin, I guess. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1477.0s)]
*  I'm a hit man. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1481.0s)]
*  I brought you the shorts that I fought Paul Felder in. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1482.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1485.0s)]
*  They're a little beat up. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1486.0s)]
*  But thank you. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1487.0s)]

*  That's awesome. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1490.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1491.0s)]
*  They're clean. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1492.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1493.0s)]
*  That's fucking awesome. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1494.0s)]
*  I also have a coaster from when I fought Luke Rock hold. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1495.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1500.0s)]
*  It's got all of us on there. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1501.0s)]
*  These are from Wuhan, China. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1503.0s)]
*  When when covid happened, I've had these air fresheners for a while. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1506.0s)]
*  So I got like a couple designs. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1511.0s)]
*  I got you a few. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1513.0s)]
*  It's like PMP and my little character. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1515.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1520.0s)]
*  So I got those. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1522.0s)]

*  Oh, my pleasure, man. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1542.0s)]
*  It's very kind of you. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1543.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me on the show, bro. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1544.0s)]
*  And I wish you would have told me about your show. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1547.0s)]
*  But like, God just works, man, because we just went for a walk. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1550.0s)]
*  I asked my girl, I said, where do we go in Austin? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1554.0s)]
*  She knows Texas. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1556.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1557.0s)]
*  And she's like 6th Street. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1558.0s)]
*  So we start fucking walking and we're like, oh, it's just comedy. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1561.0s)]
*  So right here, man, everybody's in line. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1564.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1567.0s)]
*  We get in line. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1568.0s)]
*  We hit a lady. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1569.0s)]
*  If you're here for Joe Rogan, you know, this line, seven o'clock. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1570.0s)]
*  I'm like, let's go. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1574.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1577.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1578.0s)]
*  And you guys hooked us up anyways and got us in there. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1579.0s)]
*  And we were sitting up top, man. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1582.0s)]
*  It was a great show. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1583.0s)]
*  You guys are geniuses. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1584.0s)]
*  The way you talk and weave through a conversation, I don't know where you're going. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1586.0s)]
*  And then boom, a punchline hits. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1592.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1594.0s)]
*  Thanks, man. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1595.0s)]
*  I'm glad you had a good time. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1596.0s)]
*  So smart. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1597.0s)]
*  It's a fun place. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1598.0s)]
*  I didn't know you were coming to town yesterday. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1599.0s)]
*  I would have invited you. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1600.0s)]
*  I wasn't sure if you're coming to town today. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1601.0s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1604.0s)]
*  Sometimes people come in the day of. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1605.0s)]
*  I wasn't sure if you had set it up by my managers do it for me. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1606.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1610.0s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you came. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1611.0s)]
*  First round management, Abe, Malkey. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1612.0s)]
*  Yeah, that place is wild. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1614.0s)]
*  It's like that whole street is wild. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1616.0s)]
*  Sixth Street. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1618.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1619.0s)]
*  Like on Saturday night, we're looking through the window. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1620.0s)]
*  It's like a zombie movie. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1622.0s)]
*  All these people walking down the streets because it's closed off. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1623.0s)]
*  It's a little bit like L.A. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1625.0s)]
*  Well, parts of it are. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1627.0s)]
*  I didn't expect that. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1628.0s)]
*  There's more tents lately, I've noticed. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1630.0s)]
*  Like they clean them up and then they come back again for a while. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1634.0s)]
*  They kind of they had housed a lot of people. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1637.0s)]
*  It's not that as bad, though. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1639.0s)]
*  I guess L.A. has spots that you know, L.A. is crazy. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1641.0s)]
*  L.A. doesn't make sense. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1645.0s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1646.0s)]
*  And that's the most expensive place to live in in the United States, really. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1647.0s)]
*  I mean, New York and L.A. and they can get, you know, them projects get. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1651.0s)]
*  The thing about cities like that is once they slide, it's really hard to bring them back [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1655.0s)]
*  because they're like battleships, you know, and they're moved in a bad direction. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1661.0s)]
*  When you get overrun by homelessness and crime, people just start moving out. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1665.0s)]
*  And we have this, I think, a distorted idea that the way things like if something's great, it's going to stay great. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1670.0s)]
*  If something's a thing that's valuable, it's going to stay valuable. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1678.0s)]
*  People going to get to a point where you're living in a place like that, where there's tents everywhere. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1681.0s)]
*  You go, I got to get the fuck out of here. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1685.0s)]
*  And then everybody gets the fuck out of there, except for the people in the tents. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1687.0s)]
*  They're going to take it over. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1691.0s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is nuts. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1694.0s)]
*  You're not even allowed to litter. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1697.0s)]
*  You can't litter, right? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1699.0s)]
*  So how can you leave all your shit in a tent on the sidewalk? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1701.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1705.0s)]
*  They have piles of trash. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1706.0s)]
*  The whole thing is crazy. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1707.0s)]
*  It's like you can't just camp places. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1709.0s)]
*  You got to figure, there's got to be a better solution than just letting people camp places. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1711.0s)]
*  And I don't know what Austin did for a while, though. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1716.0s)]
*  They housed people. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1719.0s)]
*  They put them in hotels or something because they cleaned up a giant part of it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1721.0s)]
*  I know there's a bunch of programs to try to teach them trades. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1726.0s)]
*  And there's these housing options that some of the philanthropists out here have set up where they're trying to kind of reintroduce some of these people back to the community. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1731.0s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1743.0s)]
*  But they did something, and then it seems like it's kind of sliding back again. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1745.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's all over the country now, which you never saw before. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1749.0s)]
*  When you were a kid, do you remember seeing people just camped out? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1755.0s)]
*  I lived in Flint, and I don't remember seeing a bunch of homeless people. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1758.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1762.0s)]
*  Flint was supposed to be a rough town in the hood, but I don't know. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1763.0s)]
*  Twenty years ago, life was different. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1769.0s)]
*  Don't they say there's like 100,000 homeless people in L.A.? Isn't it something crazy like that? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1772.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1777.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1778.0s)]
*  That's like the population of Boulder, Colorado. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1779.0s)]
*  Just homeless people. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1783.0s)]
*  How do people pull up, though? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1784.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1786.0s)]
*  Like, Cubans pull up to Miami on these boats that they got a piece of wood and they oared 90 miles in this boat with like 17 family members. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1787.0s)]
*  And they pull up on the beach and they go start their life. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1797.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know why? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1801.0s)]
*  Because they're escaping communism. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1803.0s)]
*  Right. No, I mean, props. Absolutely. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1805.0s)]
*  But I'm saying these folks, they're not escaping communism. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1808.0s)]
*  Most of them are mentally ill. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1811.0s)]
*  When you're getting homeless people, most of those people are mentally ill. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1813.0s)]
*  Or like severe drug addicts. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1817.0s)]
*  Because they're on drugs. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1819.0s)]
*  Yeah. They're on drugs and they're mentally ill or both or because of. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1820.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, but that's a lot of it. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1824.0s)]
*  And so like in San Francisco, that's the big criticism that there's a guy named Michael Schellenberger and he wrote a book called San Francisco describing like what happens when progressives ruin cities like they're ruining San Francisco. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1827.0s)]
*  And he was saying like, it just gets to a point where it's just it's just it's what's going on is too nuts. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1840.0s)]
*  Like you're allowing these people to have these open air drug dens. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1848.0s)]
*  It's a choice. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1853.0s)]
*  And you're paying them money to stay there. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1854.0s)]
*  They're paying them money. They're paying money. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1856.0s)]
*  They're giving them money. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1858.0s)]
*  They interviewed these guys that were like camped out and they're saying one of the good things about being a homeless person in San Francisco is they give you money. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1859.0s)]
*  Give you like a certain amount of money. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1865.0s)]
*  Yeah, give you a certain amount of money every month. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1867.0s)]
*  And so there's no incentive to ever bringing it on themselves. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1870.0s)]
*  But you got to want more in life. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1874.0s)]
*  You got to see cool shit and be like, I fucking want to put those. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1876.0s)]
*  It's hard to be organized. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1879.0s)]
*  That's that's my biggest problem. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1882.0s)]
*  Why I'm not so rich. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1885.0s)]
*  I think I got to organize my shit, man. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1887.0s)]
*  I get I keep a bunch of momentos and I start hoarding shit. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1890.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, man, we're moving right now. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1896.0s)]
*  I'm trying. I'm trying to buy this house. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1898.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to close on a beautiful home. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1899.0s)]
*  Beautiful home. But we need a new appraisal. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1901.0s)]
*  We got one and they're getting another one. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1904.0s)]
*  So they pushed the day. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1906.0s)]
*  But I'm hoping we can get in here because I got the money for it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1908.0s)]
*  So let me in. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1912.0s)]
*  And but, you know, forgot my point again, man. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1913.0s)]
*  We should spark that back up. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1918.0s)]
*  Maybe I remember. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1922.0s)]
*  Refire up the engines. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1924.0s)]
*  What were you saying? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1927.0s)]
*  I don't know. I keep looking at that alien that spaceship beaming up that person. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1930.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1935.0s)]
*  All that alien shit. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1936.0s)]
*  Oh, it's all popping right now. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1937.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1939.0s)]
*  What are they trying to hide? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1940.0s)]
*  They're just putting all this information out there. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1942.0s)]
*  That's fake. It's bullshit. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1944.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1946.0s)]
*  It's like, thank you. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1947.0s)]
*  What are they trying to hide? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1948.0s)]
*  Like, why? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1949.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. I'm so greedy. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1950.0s)]
*  CGI shit. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1952.0s)]
*  There's fake shit. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1953.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1954.0s)]
*  I don't know what's fake and what's not fake. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1955.0s)]
*  But I do know that it just seems weird that all this is coming at you. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1957.0s)]
*  Aliens are my cousin, though. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1961.0s)]
*  I fuck with the aliens. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1963.0s)]
*  If they come here, if they want to start some shit, I'll punch one of them in the face. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1965.0s)]
*  But they better know how to act and they coming up in my backyard. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1969.0s)]
*  The planet is ours. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1972.0s)]
*  So, you know, we got to have each other's back. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1974.0s)]
*  If they really here, they ain't here. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1976.0s)]
*  They could probably destroy us if they could come here. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1978.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1982.0s)]
*  Did you see that thing in Vegas? [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1983.0s)]
*  This family said that a UFO landed in their backyard and like an eight to 10 foot tall alien came out. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1986.0s)]
*  Have we talked about this yet? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1992.0s)]
*  I don't think. I mean, not on here. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1993.0s)]
*  No, I'm here. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1996.0s)]
*  Have you seen him, Mike Perry? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1997.0s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1998.0s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=1999.0s)]
*  It seems so dumb. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2000.0s)]
*  First of all, why didn't they film it? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2002.0s)]
*  They filmed all this other shit. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2004.0s)]
*  Why didn't they film that? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2005.0s)]
*  They tried. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2006.0s)]
*  Did they try? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2007.0s)]
*  I mean, I could play their side of the story. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2008.0s)]
*  What do you think? What do you think? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2009.0s)]
*  I'm just being skeptical. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2010.0s)]
*  I saw this little Spanish kid was talking about on Instagram, they were like making a video. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2011.0s)]
*  I saw it. We saw it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2018.0s)]
*  It was real. It's like y'all look like paid actors. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2019.0s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2023.0s)]
*  Investigative reporter George Knapp tried to interview them on several occasions and they made appointments to have them interview them. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2025.0s)]
*  And when he went there, they wouldn't answer the door. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2032.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2037.0s)]
*  Maybe they're nervous about all the attention. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2038.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2041.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2042.0s)]
*  That seems real. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2043.0s)]
*  They don't want the attention. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2044.0s)]
*  They're like, we're not answering the door. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2046.0s)]
*  That's possible. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2048.0s)]
*  What normal people don't want the attention? [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2049.0s)]
*  That's right. He said they're like nine feet 10. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2051.0s)]
*  That's you got the wrong thing. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2056.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2058.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2059.0s)]
*  What is? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2060.0s)]
*  I think the podcast is still put on Spotify. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2061.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's it. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2063.0s)]
*  Whoops. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2065.0s)]
*  Uh, sound camera footage. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2069.0s)]
*  I have butterflies, bro. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2073.0s)]
*  Everyone thought I was shooting stars and these people said there's aliens in their backyard. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2075.0s)]
*  So when that 911 call came in less than an hour later, police were ready to believe it. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2078.0s)]
*  It was like a big creature. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2083.0s)]
*  A big creature? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2084.0s)]
*  Yeah, like a long 10 feet tall. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2085.0s)]
*  Because I'm not going to BS you guys. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2086.0s)]
*  One of my partners said they saw something fall out of the sky too. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2087.0s)]
*  So that's why I'm kind of curious. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2090.0s)]
*  Did you see anything land in your backyard? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2091.0s)]
*  But after a brief investigation of the yard, officers closed the case. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2093.0s)]
*  There's a whole video about nothing really. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2097.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2106.0s)]
*  If I was an alien, those exactly the kind of people that I would talk to. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2108.0s)]
*  That would know what it would believe you. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2111.0s)]
*  This is a CGI thing. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2113.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2114.0s)]
*  Why do they have CGI? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2115.0s)]
*  I don't know why they would do that. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2116.0s)]
*  Why are you telling me what I should see? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2118.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2122.0s)]
*  I think for sure it's possible that alien life exists and is visiting. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2123.0s)]
*  For sure it's possible. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2127.0s)]
*  But also it just seems real weird that they're so forthcoming with information and all these whistleblowers and everything. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2128.0s)]
*  Part of me is going like... [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2136.0s)]
*  Do you think aliens get sex changes? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2138.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they gave up on sex totally. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2141.0s)]
*  If you look at like what a gray... [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2143.0s)]
*  They have mental sex, like telekinesis and they're like, oh. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2145.0s)]
*  If you look at what those grays look like, they have giant heads. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2147.0s)]
*  They have spindly bodies and no gender. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2151.0s)]
*  They're genderless. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2154.0s)]
*  They probably don't reproduce with sex anymore. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2156.0s)]
*  They probably reproduce through technology. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2159.0s)]
*  And they probably all look exactly the same. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2162.0s)]
*  So they're equal in some weird way. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2166.0s)]
*  We're living in the Matrix. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2168.0s)]
*  So we're asleep right now. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2170.0s)]
*  If you can imagine being a human being, right? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2171.0s)]
*  Imagine being a person. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2174.0s)]
*  You can imagine being another life form that eventually gets to a place and evolves either through technology or what to what those things are. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2176.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2185.0s)]
*  We all adapt in evolution. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2186.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2188.0s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2189.0s)]
*  We're not going to stop wherever we are now. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2190.0s)]
*  We're going to keep going. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2192.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to grow wings and fly. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2193.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2196.0s)]
*  That would be cool. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2197.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2198.0s)]
*  Do you think that that I mean that's what I've thought many times when I see that that classic gray alien with the big head, the big black eyes. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2199.0s)]
*  I always think maybe that's what we are in the future. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2207.0s)]
*  Maybe that's us. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2210.0s)]
*  Maybe that's what we're saying. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2212.0s)]
*  I was just thinking about that metal statue you have out there. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2214.0s)]
*  The wolf fucking the gorilla. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2218.0s)]
*  Oh, you know what that's from? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2221.0s)]
*  That was a dream that I had. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2223.0s)]
*  I had this crazy dream. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2225.0s)]
*  Yes, somebody make a dream. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2228.0s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2230.0s)]
*  I had this crazy dream that is werewolf was fucking a gorilla. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2231.0s)]
*  Did you draw a picture? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2235.0s)]
*  No, I was just saying like I was just having a conversation with a friend and I was saying like what the fuck is dreams like? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2237.0s)]
*  Why are dreams so fucked up? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2244.0s)]
*  And I had this dream that I was like sneaking around like trying like the outside of the wall, hoping they wouldn't notice me. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2246.0s)]
*  While werewolf was fucking a gorilla. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2252.0s)]
*  Like it made no sense. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2255.0s)]
*  That's so some dude made a sculpture of it and sent it to me. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2257.0s)]
*  I feel like I don't dream, man. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2261.0s)]
*  You don't dream at all? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2263.0s)]
*  I feel like I don't really have any memories of dreams. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2265.0s)]
*  That's pretty dope. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2269.0s)]
*  But I'd be like living the dream. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2270.0s)]
*  What a crazy dream. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2272.0s)]
*  I try to. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2274.0s)]
*  This is my brain. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2275.0s)]
*  You smoke a lot of weed though, right? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2277.0s)]
*  Not as much as I used to. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2279.0s)]
*  I think that for me when I stop whenever I take breaks, my dreams become way more vivid. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2281.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2289.0s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2290.0s)]
*  But then sometimes I'm like I've been smoking and then I do have a dream. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2291.0s)]
*  But like I don't remember it later. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2297.0s)]
*  I mean, I've told my girl a couple of times about I had a dream last night. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2300.0s)]
*  She always dreams that being bad or cheating. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2306.0s)]
*  I'm like why are you dreaming like that? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2313.0s)]
*  I'll be here at the house or I'll go work out in the gym. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2317.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2320.0s)]
*  So you know. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2322.0s)]
*  The weirdest things about dreams is that right when you wake up they're so vivid. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2324.0s)]
*  But then a few minutes later you can't remember what the fuck it was. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2329.0s)]
*  It was so interesting to you when you wake up. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2332.0s)]
*  Wow, that dream was crazy. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2335.0s)]
*  I feel like dreams piss me off. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2337.0s)]
*  That's why I choose to like deny them sometimes. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2339.0s)]
*  You choose to deny them? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2342.0s)]
*  They piss me off because I'm like I can't do nothing. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2343.0s)]
*  I can't grab. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2346.0s)]
*  I can't punch you in your face. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2347.0s)]
*  In a dream. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2350.0s)]
*  But in real life I can control everything. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2351.0s)]
*  I've had one where I can't run away. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2355.0s)]
*  Like you can't run. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2358.0s)]
*  Like you can't run. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2360.0s)]
*  Something's chasing after you and your legs aren't working right. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2361.0s)]
*  Or you're in the wall that's sinking. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2364.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2368.0s)]
*  Damn, I got to make a statue of one of my dreams. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2369.0s)]
*  A statue like that? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2374.0s)]
*  Like that, yeah. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2376.0s)]
*  I got to do that. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2377.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder how much dreams are of reflection. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2379.0s)]
*  Of like whatever's in our genetics. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2384.0s)]
*  Like what if there's genetic memory? [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2389.0s)]
*  I wonder if it's like some dreams or like some genetic memory from the past. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2391.0s)]
*  We all remember when you were on Fear Factor and made people eat milk penises. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2395.0s)]
*  We all remember that. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2403.0s)]
*  It's like that's a memory that is in humankind's genetics. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2404.0s)]
*  We're living it right now. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2410.0s)]
*  We're all oppressed. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2414.0s)]
*  But I'm wondering like I wonder how much of like fears and dreams. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2416.0s)]
*  Like I've had a bunch of dreams about being chased by wolves. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2420.0s)]
*  A bunch. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2424.0s)]
*  And I've always wondered what that is. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2426.0s)]
*  I don't run from wolves. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2428.0s)]
*  You don't run? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2429.0s)]
*  I feel like I would give them a hug. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2430.0s)]
*  Come here baby. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2433.0s)]
*  Come here baby. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2434.0s)]
*  I'll wrestle that motherfucker to the ground. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2435.0s)]
*  I'll grab a fucking wolf and bite his ass shit ears. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2437.0s)]
*  Be like boy, I run this shit. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2439.0s)]
*  Stop. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2442.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2443.0s)]
*  I have a German Shepherd. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2444.0s)]
*  He's a baby though. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2446.0s)]
*  It's a big difference between that and the wolf. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2447.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2450.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2451.0s)]
*  You talk about a dog killing a bunch of jackals. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2452.0s)]
*  I'll get a dog. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2456.0s)]
*  I'm human. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2459.0s)]
*  We on top of the food chain. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2460.0s)]
*  Fuck the aliens. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2462.0s)]
*  I'm trying to eat some aliens. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2463.0s)]
*  I'm trying to eat some aliens. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2465.0s)]
*  I want to try that shit. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2466.0s)]
*  Is that cannibalism? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2467.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2469.0s)]
*  Eating an alien? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2470.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2471.0s)]
*  It's probably frowned upon. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2472.0s)]
*  There was this movie. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2473.0s)]
*  Like octopus? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2476.0s)]
*  This movie called Moment of Contact. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2477.0s)]
*  There's a UFO crashed in Virginia, Brazil in 1996. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2480.0s)]
*  This cop had carried one of the bodies, like the injured alien. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2485.0s)]
*  They put it in the back of the car and they drove it to the hospital. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2490.0s)]
*  Then they took it to another hospital. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2493.0s)]
*  It's all documented. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2495.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2496.0s)]
*  The cop who was carrying the alien died of a horrific bacterial infection that they couldn't cure him of. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2498.0s)]
*  Antibiotics didn't worry him. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2506.0s)]
*  He was a young guy. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2508.0s)]
*  He was dead within like a couple of weeks. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2509.0s)]
*  They don't know what the fuck it was. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2511.0s)]
*  Doctors had never seen anything like it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2513.0s)]
*  Doctors are crazy. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2515.0s)]
*  Imagine if he's telling the truth. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2517.0s)]
*  Imagine there really is a little alien spacecraft that crashed and he picked up a body and tried to carry it to the hospital. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2519.0s)]
*  This being. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2526.0s)]
*  Imagine them bringing a fucking alien into a hospital. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2527.0s)]
*  Like hey, look what we got here. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2532.0s)]
*  They do. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2534.0s)]
*  We are aliens. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2535.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2536.0s)]
*  We are or we ain't. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2537.0s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2539.0s)]
*  Is it cannibalism if I eat one of them? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2540.0s)]
*  No, because they're different species of us, whatever we are. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2542.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2546.0s)]
*  We're just a germ. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2547.0s)]
*  Remember Powerpuff Girls and they had the germ dudes and then the green dudes? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2549.0s)]
*  No, I don't remember. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2556.0s)]
*  You were already grown up when I was watching Powerpuff Girls. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2558.0s)]
*  I'm still kind of young so I can fight for a little. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2561.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're only 31. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2564.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2565.0s)]
*  But how old were you when you had your first UFC fight? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2566.0s)]
*  24. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2569.0s)]
*  And how much formal training? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2574.0s)]
*  When did you start formally MMA training? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2576.0s)]
*  Training MMA in a gym? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2579.0s)]
*  15 years ago. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2582.0s)]
*  I did it as a kid. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2587.0s)]
*  My dad talked about it. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2589.0s)]
*  He did a couple kickboxing matches. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2591.0s)]
*  Like one or two. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2594.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2598.0s)]
*  But he fought in the streets and stuff, I guess. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2599.0s)]
*  My dad was a wild dude. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2601.0s)]
*  He had bags. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2604.0s)]
*  He was a Navy guy. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2606.0s)]
*  I would use some of his boxing equipment at a young age. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2610.0s)]
*  I've always been punching. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2616.0s)]
*  But formal training, I trained myself for a long time. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2618.0s)]
*  You too, like I said. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2624.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2625.0s)]
*  I got with Julian Williams. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2626.0s)]
*  This Central Florida group of mixed martial artists have been around for, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2629.0s)]
*  it feels like 15 years. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2634.0s)]
*  I've been knowing them since I was in my teens. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2637.0s)]
*  Formal training. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2642.0s)]
*  Did you go through an amateur MMA program? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2644.0s)]
*  Did you have any amateur fights? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2648.0s)]
*  Yes, I had like 20 amateur fights. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2650.0s)]
*  I guess it was a scattered version. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2654.0s)]
*  There are things that are more organized and put together. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2657.0s)]
*  The little kids that do boxing all over the country, they're fighting every week. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2661.0s)]
*  They get how many fights before they go pro? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2667.0s)]
*  100 fights, 200 fights, Lomachenko, 300 fights. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2670.0s)]
*  Before they go pro, these kids and their parents. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2674.0s)]
*  I see that now because the boxing gym I work at, Technique Boxing, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2678.0s)]
*  I get to be around that type of whatever that is. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2683.0s)]
*  That's that deep down, the soul of it. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2690.0s)]
*  It's about the kids and they become great boxers over the years of doing it. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2694.0s)]
*  I've done it too, but we were like one of the first. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2700.0s)]
*  Fighting was already around in the 80s. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2708.0s)]
*  Then there's boxing, obviously. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2713.0s)]
*  Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali, obviously those were big fights. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2716.0s)]
*  Now there's more formal kids. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2720.0s)]
*  The Karate Combat dudes, they've been raised well by their parents. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2726.0s)]
*  They have manners and they have technique in karate. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2734.0s)]
*  It's different if you look at all the techniques. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2739.0s)]
*  Muay Thai is like a dog fight, but there is technique. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2743.0s)]
*  When I say technique, it's like positions of your body. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2747.0s)]
*  That's how you generate force and physically control whatever is happening. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2754.0s)]
*  That's what we're talking about. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2763.0s)]
*  How do you fight? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2766.0s)]
*  Shit, why? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2769.0s)]
*  I wish I could bring something else to the world that means more. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2772.0s)]
*  The world does piss me off sometimes, so I get to punch somebody for this. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2779.0s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2784.0s)]
*  How can I be an addition to society and make a difference and build something [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2786.0s)]
*  and think about something and be smart? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2795.0s)]
*  Fuck, man, being smarter is harder, bro. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2797.0s)]
*  It's fucking hard out here. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2800.0s)]
*  What about maybe, have you thought about starting a gym? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2803.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to do a fight thing, a business company. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2808.0s)]
*  A fight business company? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2819.0s)]
*  Like a promotion company? [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2823.0s)]
*  There's a lot of ways a guy like you can relate to people like you. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2824.0s)]
*  There's a lot of guys that want to fight too. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2832.0s)]
*  There's a lot of angry men. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2835.0s)]
*  They want to relate to a guy who's figured out a way to positively channel that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2837.0s)]
*  It is really positive, but then it becomes funny. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2842.0s)]
*  I feel like I understand fighting to the point where I see I'm having trouble seeing the point of fighting. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2845.0s)]
*  It seems like a joke. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2855.0s)]
*  It's a fun sport, but there comes a time, I think, when it becomes ... [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2857.0s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2865.0s)]
*  Am I going to put it ahead of me and make it more important than my own self? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2867.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm not getting hurt, to be honest, but I do take some hits in training. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2873.0s)]
*  That shit add up. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2878.0s)]
*  I've been taking punches for 20 years. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2879.0s)]
*  It doesn't hurt until later. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2881.0s)]
*  It hurts later. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2887.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2890.0s)]
*  Have you given thought to doing something else? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2896.0s)]
*  Have you given thought to what you're going to do when you're done with this? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2898.0s)]
*  No, I feel like I'm just going to construction. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2901.0s)]
*  Just be an old guy. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2904.0s)]
*  Construction? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2906.0s)]
*  Start fixing shit, man. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2907.0s)]
*  Pick up some tools, old school. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2908.0s)]
*  I've got to get a hot rod again, man. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2910.0s)]
*  I've fucked around with a few hot rods. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2913.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, I've just got to get another one and make it nice. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2916.0s)]
*  I'll be driving the family around now. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2920.0s)]
*  Everything's on hold. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2924.0s)]
*  I really just have faith in God, and I try to do what's right and be good. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2926.0s)]
*  As long as I support those around me, the women and children, I'll be good to go. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2932.0s)]
*  How did this bare-knuckle thing come about? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2940.0s)]
*  Did you just want to test the waters over there? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2945.0s)]
*  Was it just a lucrative offer? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2949.0s)]
*  What made you go over there? [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2951.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2953.0s)]
*  Big money. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2954.0s)]
*  It was big to me. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2955.0s)]
*  It was definitely big. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2957.0s)]
*  It was big fights. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2958.0s)]
*  But there wasn't a ton of people at the arena when I fought MVP, but everybody did see it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2961.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2969.0s)]
*  Well, I think after this Rockhold fight, it's changed people's appreciation for, first of all, how difficult it is. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2971.0s)]
*  When you see Rockhold's jaw fucked up with his teeth fucked up, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2979.0s)]
*  and you see that you've been beating guys like him and Michael Venom Page, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2984.0s)]
*  and it's like, these are very high-level guys. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2989.0s)]
*  And you're doing it in this sport that's like, man, it's a completely different thing to me, at least. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2992.0s)]
*  The way you're describing it completely makes sense about how you have to be tight all the time, but still move well. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=2999.0s)]
*  Check this out. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3007.0s)]
*  Michael Venom Page or Misfits Boxing? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3009.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3013.0s)]
*  What's his damn name, that English kid over there that runs Misfits Boxing? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3014.0s)]
*  It's like, Most Valuable Promotions with Jake Paul. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3021.0s)]
*  KSI. KSI has Misfits Boxing. That's his. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3024.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3028.0s)]
*  And we were talking with my people about a possible tournament-style one-night, three-fights boxing with gloves. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3029.0s)]
*  Or would it be kickboxing with gloves? I don't know what it was, right? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3041.0s)]
*  But me and MVP start on different sides of the bracket, and we fight three three-minute rounds each time. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3045.0s)]
*  So the first two, me and MVP should win the fights, and then we're fighting again in the finals for rounds seven, eight, and nine. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3056.0s)]
*  We would be fighting each other, so it would be three opponents, three fights in one night. It would pay a bunch of money per fight. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3068.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3077.0s)]
*  I think that sounded kind of cool. I would definitely give MVP another shot. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3078.0s)]
*  This is an event they have announced. They have a tag team event going on, and a survivor tag match, too. I wonder how that works. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3084.0s)]
*  Tag team. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3091.0s)]
*  Yeah, like Kimbo Slice Jr.'s on here, Haseem Rahman Jr. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3092.0s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3096.0s)]
*  I have no idea how it's going based off of that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3097.0s)]
*  How are they going to do that? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3100.0s)]
*  That seems interesting to watch. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3101.0s)]
*  Tag team. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3102.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3103.0s)]
*  Huh. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3104.0s)]
*  Oh my God. That's going to be wild. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3105.0s)]
*  Well, it just kind of makes sense, right? People are always trying to push the boundaries. People are always trying to like, okay, is that hardcore enough? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3108.0s)]
*  What about if we have a bunch of dudes fighting? Like you've seen those Russian videos. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3116.0s)]
*  Old school UFC. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3121.0s)]
*  Where they have teams of dudes meet on a field and just start beating the fuck out of each other? [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3122.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, like 200, 600. 200 out, let's go. I want to try that shit, though. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3126.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3132.0s)]
*  See, where is that group of fighting people, man? That's wild. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3133.0s)]
*  I think it was in Russia. Was that where it was? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3139.0s)]
*  I think there was Ireland, too, man. Gypsies. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3140.0s)]
*  Car fights. Fighting in a phone booth. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3143.0s)]
*  Russians are just different, man. They're just different. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3145.0s)]
*  Well put together, American is fucking up there, though. We're up there. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3150.0s)]
*  Oh, for sure. For sure. But we're not having groups of 200 people meet groups of 200 people and just running into each other on a football field and beating the fuck out of each other. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3156.0s)]
*  Come on, let's go, America. Let's do the American team versus that big Russian team, man. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3167.0s)]
*  Let's see what happens. 200 on 200. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3172.0s)]
*  Bro, that would be scary. What is this? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3175.0s)]
*  The team fighting championship. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3178.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3180.0s)]
*  Which is sort of what... [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3182.0s)]
*  It's not the giant field one, but this is kind of insane. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3184.0s)]
*  So this is in Poland versus Sweden. Oh my God, this is insane. Jesus Christ. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3186.0s)]
*  I went to Russia and they tried to fight me at a press conference. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3193.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Where did you go to Russia for? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3199.0s)]
*  My friend was fighting. Fucker. He fucking got beat up by this big Russian guy. He fights giants, man. He just fought... [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3203.0s)]
*  He just fought... What's that dude's name in the UFC? Johnny, the 205er, light heavyweight. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3215.0s)]
*  Johnny Walker. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3231.0s)]
*  Johnny Walker. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3232.0s)]
*  And his brother, he has a brother that's 12 and 0 or 11 and 0 now because he beat Alex, but he's like 260 pounds, I think. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3233.0s)]
*  And Alex is like 220 or 225. And he fights these heavyweights. He had a good battle with him. He didn't win out one, but... [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3242.0s)]
*  Johnny Walker is an interesting guy. That dude has crazy power. Look at that. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3252.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. That's him. Good for him, man. He had a good fight, my boy. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3261.0s)]
*  Very interesting. 11 and 0. Johnny Walker, he generates power for some crazy ways. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3267.0s)]
*  Like when he's fighting Paul Craig and Paul Craig grabbed ahold of his leg and he's KO'ing him while he's hopping around on one leg. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3276.0s)]
*  Jamal Hill, bro. That time that he got hit in the forehead like that and he put Johnny down. Jamal Hill is cool, bro. He just fights, man. He just get in there. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3284.0s)]
*  He's got amazing timing, too. His timing is... He's long. But strong, though. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3300.0s)]
*  Yeah, long and strong. When he fought Glover, I was like, God, man. Jamal's like... And he's coming into his own, too. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3308.0s)]
*  There's a thing that happens to a guy when he hits that championship level where they're just coming in their own and they start to really shine. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3319.0s)]
*  And that's where he's at. That guy's got crazy power. He's a fun dude, too. Boom. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3326.0s)]
*  That's wild, man. Sorry, Johnny. It's crazy. Let's go. Jamal from Grand Blank. That's where he lives. I was talking to him the other day. I'm like, shit, I want to train with him. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3332.0s)]
*  He's the champ at 205 outside of John Jones. Is he undefeated, Jamal Hill? No. Paul Craig tapped him out. Oh, his armbar. Yeah, see, Paul Craig, he be having ups and downs. He can beat anyone with that grappling. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3344.0s)]
*  That grappling is crazy. His guard is crazy. His guard's crazy. He just cinches up those triangles on you. You just got to smash when somebody's grabbing you, you know? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3361.0s)]
*  Well, that's what Johnny Walker did. That's what Johnny Walker did. To Paul Craig. Yeah, I remember him just holding onto that leg trying to get the tank down. Johnny Walker's just so fucking athletic. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3371.0s)]
*  He's an interesting dude, man. I mean, if you back it up so you can see how it started. He grabs his leg and he's KOing him while he's holding his leg up in the air. That is nuts. That kind of power is nuts. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3382.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. See, that hurt his head, man. He's a big dude for 205. He's so big. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3401.0s)]
*  I love the fights, man. Oh, Yoel Romero's fighting Bellator this weekend. I know. Isn't that wild? He looks like he's 30 years old. Oh my gosh. He does. He looks exactly the same. He looks exactly the same. That dude is amazing. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3408.0s)]
*  He's a good soul, man. He's a good soul. Yoel is very strong. He holds up the community, man. Support him. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3425.0s)]
*  I had a podcast I did with him and Joey Diaz. Joey Diaz translated. So Yoel would say some of the stuff in English, but then he would say some of the stuff in Spanish and Joey Diaz would translate. It was amazing. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3433.0s)]
*  Yeah, Joey Diaz is cool, man. He's a crazy guy, man. Good for him. Yeah, he's the best. Can of corn. Can of corn and I'll be fine. Except from the longest yard, man, that he was in there. Joey Diaz. Hilarious. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3446.0s)]
*  Yeah. He came from Cuba as well. And the way they were describing the system over in Cuba and Yoel was talking about the wrestling system that he came up through. He goes, it makes you a machine. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3463.0s)]
*  Machine. That's good, man. Machine. I want to be an actor, bro. Is that what you want to do? I'm getting big. Why not? Oh, you can do it. Let me be a bad guy in a movie or something, man. That's what I'm saying. How about you and John Wick 5? Let's go. Let's go. Keanu. Come on, man. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3480.0s)]
*  You would be an amazing bad guy assassin with a suit or a sharp suit on. Come on, Mike Perry. That would actually, that actually would work. That actually would work. I could see that. I'm about to go get married in Vegas, man. All right, man. About to go do it. Have a good time with the fam. Nice. Some fun. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3498.0s)]
*  So do you have any fights lined up? Like how does it work after this last, which, you know, this is like the most popular performance in terms of the amount of people that watched the Rockhold fight. Was that like the biggest one that they put on? So do they have anything lined up for you? [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3521.0s)]
*  Apparently, you know, there's a couple of deals on the table and I really don't know what's, you know, am I supposed to decide what happens? I really, my team is trying to give me the best deal possible. Life changing deal. You know, I had success against Rockhold and it's, I've been doing good and I'm trying to stay on that path. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3542.0s)]
*  And, you know, I'll fight anyone. That's it. Don't matter. I'll fight. And, you know, a lot of haters on the Internet, man. Come on, UFC. Give me a good deal, man. Give me a good deal. I don't think they match a deal like the ones that I'm going to get, though. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3569.0s)]
*  I mean, where do I want to be champion? Where do I get the most views? That's what I want. I want to fight in front of the biggest crowd I can and people enjoy it. Enjoy the show, man, because I'm going to go for broke. Headbutt your shit and fucking, and they don't matter if it's bare knuckle or if it's with gloves or boxing gloves or boxing ring. Anthony Pettis just fought Roy Jones Jr. It was a great fight. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3589.0s)]
*  You know, I think that's a great fight for me in boxing match. And I love Anthony and God bless him. And he's a competitor. And, you know, it's just a fun little boxing match. And if we could get paid good for it, I want to do it and show up and spar. I want to work with pro fighters all over. So I said I wanted to go work with Jamal Hill. What do you think I mean when I say work? We're going to put gloves on and try to swing at each other. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3616.0s)]
*  So we might as well just fight. I'll fight Jamal Hill. God bless him too. I mean, he'll probably beat my ass. He's too big. He's 205'er. But give me a chance. I'll try it. Let's go. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3645.0s)]
*  I know you would. I'll try it. There's a fucking hilarious. The bigger they are, the harder they fall, man. There's a hilarious video of you with Darren Till. Yeah, that's a good fight. That's a great fight. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3655.0s)]
*  But when you're saying to him, do you want to spar? And he thought you were saying, do you want to go to the spa? Like, yeah, like, no, I think he knew what I meant. I think that was just his joke. He's a clever little fucker. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3664.0s)]
*  So, you know, but he's that's a great fight. Where do we want to do that fight? Who wants to take that fight and get the viewers from it? It's me and Darren Till in any way, either MMA because he did MMA. Mosfet all clapped his face. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3679.0s)]
*  And then, you know, yeah, he's a big guy that was cutting down to 172. I mean, do you think that when those guys really cut down like that, that affects your chin? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3700.0s)]
*  People want to see me fucking fight in Africa because they say I'm from. That's what they say all over the Internet. That's the joke that goes around. Is it on 4chan? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3714.0s)]
*  Fucking on Fortune? 4chan. You know what that is? What is that? That's the Internet when like when you just let it go uncensored. It's a website with crazy people. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3726.0s)]
*  Well, now they are. But it sounds like something they might try to organize. It's because I said it a long time ago. Fucking, you know, I wonder if the UFC is ever going to have a fight in Africa. That would be wild. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3738.0s)]
*  You know, maybe in like the same place where Ali fought Foreman. What they got. I'm saying PFL has Francis Ngannou now. That's interesting, right? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3752.0s)]
*  Because isn't it something crazy like Francis's opponent has to get paid a million dollars? Did you read that? Let's make sure that that's true because I think I'm repeating that. But someone told me one make sure that's true. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3766.0s)]
*  It is that you know what? It was it was stylebender. He was talking to Schultz about it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3786.0s)]
*  The PFL has offered to pay Ngannou's opponent a minimum purse of two million dollars. Ngannou did not want to face an opponent was not paid what they deserve. Wow. He wants to see fighters be rewarded. He wants the best possible opponent. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3791.0s)]
*  So listen, man, that spices things up. If you know you're going to get two million bucks to fight him guys who are on like the end of their contract. And what's good about that is just like raises competition for everybody. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3810.0s)]
*  And I think there's so many fighters now that it's almost like we need more organizations. But I think we definitely need more weight classes. Don't don't you think? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3822.0s)]
*  Yeah, just meet up and fight. I weigh 195 190 right now. I probably lost some weight this morning, but 190. So, you know, I could fight a guy at the bar on the street. 200 pounds. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3834.0s)]
*  Right. But as a sport, do you think like as UFC, do you think the UFC should have more weight classes? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3853.0s)]
*  Boxing does. So, yeah, why not? I mean, who cares though? You meet up. You meet at 170 to go back to 170. I've been at 75. And then my last fight was at 185. So, but MMA is different with 185. But in boxing, I was a good size for 185. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3859.0s)]
*  I'm short and you can you can box being short. But when you're up against the kicks, you can't be dipping down. I mean, I still do good when I fight kickboxers, but I'd have to pick it back up again. I've had some trouble getting kicked before and things like that. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't think about it. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3879.0s)]
*  You don't think about it. You just fight whatever. You don't have a preference. Like if you had a preference, like if you had a preference. Would your preference be that like the UFC comes to you with a big offer? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3903.0s)]
*  Big offer. Would that be a preference? Isn't that the top of the food chain though? The pay per view, the crowd, the UFC pay per view. I mean, guys went in and out of the UFC for not since the 1990s when it came out. You know, and now and getting paid. Rampage Jackson. Love that guy, man. He's great. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3917.0s)]
*  He's got his son. He was talking about his Wanderlei son. He has a son who does fighting too. Oh, no. Their sons be fight. That could be a good fight. Oh my God. Wanderlei Rampage again. Wow. That's crazy. Those fights they had in Pride were nuts. That's something I really wish I had seen live. You never saw Pride live, huh? No, I did in Vegas. I saw Pride in Vegas, but it wasn't. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3941.4s)]
*  You see the now though. The UFC. Everyone knows. Adesanya stuff. Big fights, man. It's great to be a part of that. Oh, yeah. But what is different about Japan and the Pride era was like, you know, you got like 90,000 people at the Saitama Super Arena. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3971.4s)]
*  Or like the Thriller Manila, right? That was in Africa, right? That was in Africa. Ali versus Foreman. Yeah. Biggest fight ever. But that was when I was a kid. I couldn't have seen that. I could have gone to Japan to watch one of those big crazy Pride events. And I really feel like I should have. I really feel like I should have watched Fador fight live when he was in his prime. I should have just flown out to Japan. Fuck it. Because that's something that like that dude like you want to talk about a legend. Fador. That dude. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=3991.4s)]
*  I mean, he could do it all. YouTube stuff to Miracle Crow Cop. I watched all that stuff growing up. You know, YouTube. I got to catch everything. I studied that, I guess. Everything. When you watch on YouTube, did you get together with friends and practice? Like how did how did you put it together? Sometimes I would shadow box. Shadow boxing is huge, man. Like if you can't punch the air, then you can't punch a person. True. You got to know how to throw a punch and be prepared to miss. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4021.4s)]
*  Be prepared to land and, you know, make it count. Because that's what a punch is for. It's like I can take you out quick. I don't. But, you know, I guess that's what the gloves do. Right? Yeah. I'm gonna go back to that. The boxing gloves give you a longer fight, a harder fight. Yeah. No gloves is faster paced. They can't take it. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4051.4s)]
*  There's also the argument that you take more brain damage with gloves because you get hit more because it's easier to just hit you full blast. Yeah. You can't train bare knuckle though. So how do you train? You just train with regular boxing gloves? Well, sometimes, right? Like, but only like mitts and you can't spar with anyone. No one's trying to go bare knuckle with me. Right. We got to put 16s on and hit that way. And with head gear. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4074.4s)]
*  Don't you think in that case, like your previous experience in bare knuckle is a giant advantage to anybody who wants to just step in and try it now? Like anybody even... But I fought someone with nine fights. Yes. Oh, no doubt. My first time. Right. No doubt. But I think it's boxing. I think I know boxing good. And I think I'm a great boxer. Even though I'm 0-1. So I want to get a boxing match that counts onto my record because the trailer one didn't. Right. So I'm still technically a great boxer. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4104.4s)]
*  I'm still technically 0-1. I want to get a boxing match. Jake Paul, that would be, you know, he's about to fight Nate Diaz. So that's cool. That's a good fight, man. Good for both of them. I think Nate's going to teach him some lessons. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4134.4s)]
*  All I was getting at was that you can definitely box. Definitely. What I'm saying is that you've done it with bare knuckle more than once. Right. It's too easy, man. Nobody wants to smoke that way. Nobody wants it. But you're saying you can't spar that way. Right. You can't spar that way, right? Right. So that's a unique experience the first time anybody ever does it. But you've already done it. Right. You've done it multiple times successfully. That's a giant advantage. It's a giant advantage you have right now. Yeah. It's very interesting. Yeah. And you're such a dog that you're like particularly designed. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4151.4s)]
*  For like that kind of fighting. When I was watching that Rockhold fight, I was like, Jesus. I train a lot, man. I look if you look at pictures of me in that moment when I was fighting, I look like a different person. I've kind of lost it since that fight. I built that up so much for the camp. I was a different man. I was chiseled. I was focused. I was straightened out. I let myself go a little bit after the fight. You're supposed to. I think that's how you heal. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4181.4s)]
*  Just kind of start laying around and relax for a little bit. Yeah. Just hang out. So. Yeah. Did you bulk up for that fight? I tried to eat more. Yeah. I tried to. I eat good anyways. I love going to restaurants and just getting some nice little wagyu or caviar and all type of that. Oysters. Suck em down. I'm hungry. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4211.599999999999s)]
*  I like the sound effects. Yeah. That's hilarious. Thanks. Yeah, man. You're living good. You're supposed to. Yeah. Alcohol. I got quit though. Yeah. I will again. But damn. I'm gonna just sip on it next time. This morning was rough. Boy. I ain't gonna lie. This morning was rough. The ice bath. Like that saved my life. Woke you right up. Yeah. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4239.08s)]
*  Yeah. We have a new blue cube ice bath that is like a running river and you climb inside of it and it's torturous. It's torturous. Great. I'm thinking about it right now. I got some work. I'm getting on. I'm doing PT. What's going on with your neck? My shoulder just tight. I guess it's like, you know, I go southpaw sometimes because to try to make it feel better. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4268.36s)]
*  It's like I do so much this way that this gets tight or I get some I get hit so much maybe on this side. This side gets tight. You know what I mean? So then it just takes PT and focus on it. And you've had stem cells on it. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4297.92s)]
*  Yeah. That would be cool. I think that's your move. Put a needle. It feels like go ahead man. Just put a needle in there motherfucker. Squirt a bunch of that shit in there. Gordon Ryan had some stem cells injected. I think he was into his shoulder and it fixed his neck problem. He had a neck problem for a while he was saying. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4313.28s)]
*  And just because it goes it goes through your whole body but it's they do it on the site of the injury but it's still you know there's a lot of helps repair. Yeah repairs all over your body. It's like a sperm goop that lays all over your shit and makes new genetics or DNA maybe like attaches to your DNA. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4337.12s)]
*  I wouldn't want to grade that in a science class. I don't know. That's exactly how it goes down. It's it's it's making babies. Whatever that goop is it makes babies. Yeah it's replicating. It fixes. Yeah. It was a weird way to put it but I know what you're saying though. Yeah. I mean it's something like that. Whatever the fuck it is. You can take people's parts of other people's bodies and inject it into you and it helps things heal. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4361.28s)]
*  You just got to work on on everything anyway. So like GSP he's always posting like you know stretches that he's doing or. Yeah. So I mean he's doing that for a reason. You got to work an area out. I know that you got to train your like if when your neck's hurting you got to train like do do your back pull ups. That's why I did that motion because I'm thinking about doing my back muscles. So I've got it or the pull ends. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4385.68s)]
*  Strengthen the area around. That's old school. That's how we do it. That's how you deal with pain. You fucking work harder. And you know I guess I've never I'm talking about you know why I haven't done stem cells and I don't know. I don't really care. I'm just going to fucking deal with it and do it. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4415.72s)]
*  Well I appreciate your toughness. I appreciate your toughness. But I mean I think maybe for you just your overall ability to be at your best. Yeah. You should probably get it. Do everything I can to try. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. The money for it. So OK. I do. OK. Well 10,000 for some stem cells. I would like to know. I know that there's a really good place in Tijuana. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4437.08s)]
*  Cellular Performance Institute. I know the guys that run that and a lot of MMA fighters have gone down there. A lot of Eddie Bravo's gone down there. People went to Columbia to do. That's that bio accelerator. Panama has a great place. That's Dr. Neal Reardon's place. I actually sent my mom down there twice. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4466.32s)]
*  Oh really. Your mom got it done. Yeah she's she was having knee issues. Yeah. Yeah man it absolutely can help with some especially like soft tissue injuries. It's interesting stuff. It's just it's new advances like that. Medicine are fucking wild. Yeah I know I got to fix tissue. It's just it's always better if you're at your best especially when you're thinking about it. But I feel like that's what a camp is. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4487.44s)]
*  I get these issues. Right. I've had this this neck pain seems like my life force. That is driving my life. I feel like I never remember a time when I didn't have a pain in my neck or just a pain just walking around in your neck always or just anywhere. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4518.0s)]
*  Anywhere is understandable but if it's in the same spot. Something's always hurt. Right. Something's always hurt. Of course my finger. Right. My neck. Yeah. If you're sparring all the time something always hurt. But but what I'm worried about is that like the way you're describing it could be like a chronic injury that could be limiting your ability like Yoel who we're talking about. Yoel Romero he has his neck fused. You ever see a video of him. He had an operation where it's like his [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4537.0s)]
*  disc was so fucked up they had to fuse the discs in his neck. They had to fuse the spinal columns. Have you ever seen a video of him running. There's a video of him running and his neck doesn't move because it's like fused. It's crazy. The video says Yoel Romero runs like his neck is fused because it is. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4567.0s)]
*  That's not what the back is. I don't know if that. He don't really looks like. Yeah. He does. So that's that's his his neck is fused. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4587.72s)]
*  I think he said that that was the most frightening time of his life because he was worried that he was going to die. But there's a video of him running and it's crazy when you watch him run because like his all of this doesn't move at all. It's just completely straight. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4597.88s)]
*  He just look at this. Isn't that. Isn't that wild. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4613.76s)]
*  Booking it. But like his athleticism is insane and he's doing all this athleticism with a frozen neck. Imagine having to fight him bare knuckle. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4619.56s)]
*  That guy. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4635.72s)]
*  What a what a fucking stud. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4637.4s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4641.4s)]
*  And it's amazing that he's so good still at 46 years old. Is that what he is? Yeah that too. 46. I always think about guys like Dan Henderson. Why? I love Dan Henderson. I love his fighting. Dan Henderson's fighting. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4643.4s)]
*  He that dude like if you ever put your hand on his back. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4657.6s)]
*  Feels like his man out of wood. Like he doesn't feel like a normal person. Like something's going on. Like there's a lady who I knew that was his massage therapist. She's like it's like the most brutal thing just to get through all that hard tissue. It's all just like nodded up like fucking wire. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4661.8s)]
*  It's our evolution. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4679.4s)]
*  As fighters. So I mean I don't want it. Like I stopped. I don't like getting pedicures with girls and shit because then I'm like I earn the souls of my feet through fighting. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4681.799999999999s)]
*  Whether I wear shoes boxing or I do a barefoot MMA. You know you earn the souls of your feet. So it's like. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4696.599999999999s)]
*  You know doing certain things. I don't know. I want to fucking get a shot of stem cells in my neck right now while we're talking about it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4706.2s)]
*  Yeah you probably should. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4713.2s)]
*  I gotta go. I gotta go through another fucking country. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4714.2s)]
*  No there's some stuff they can do actually even in Austin. Waste to buy. I was in office in Austin. Yeah. You can get. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4717.2s)]
*  I'll have to look it up in Orlando. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4726.2s)]
*  You need certain treatments today in America. It's just to really go full whole hog. You gotta go somewhere else. And like I said the place down in Tijuana everybody raves about it. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4728.2s)]
*  I know a lot a lot of people I know have been there. That's the Cellular Performance Institute and then there's bioxcellerator in Columbia. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4741.2s)]
*  And there's probably other ones too including Dr. Neil Reardon's in Panama. But if you want to go there apparently they can do a lot more wild shit than we can do here. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4749.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4759.2s)]
*  Places don't be safe. I'll be staying home with the fam. Yeah. I keep myself. I do some push ups. Yeah. And eat some food. That's why I like to watch cartoons. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4763.2s)]
*  I hear you. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4775.2s)]
*  With the kids. Play games. Call of Duty man. You know play that. Yeah. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4776.2s)]
*  If you if you if you ever wanted to go to the one in Tijuana though it's like right down from San Diego. You could just drive into it. Yeah. You know San Diego California. Yeah. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4783.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's on the other side. I know. East Coast boy. East Coast boy. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4795.2s)]
*  Where are you. So you born and raised in Florida. Where did you grow up. You said Michigan. You said Flint at one point in time. And then how did you get to Florida. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4802.2s)]
*  Mom and dad separated. And I used to go back and forth. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4816.2s)]
*  There's a particular type of wild dude from Florida. It's so much so that there's like a name Florida man. You know what the fuck is it about Florida. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4821.2s)]
*  Oh I thought that was me. I thought the Florida man is me. But because there's like a whole video and a drawing. Yeah. It's like 40 minutes. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4829.2s)]
*  I've been blessed in life where people you know find things interesting about me and make some cool videos and I know you know about them. Yeah. You're the fucking coolest bro. Everybody likes you. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4840.2s)]
*  So thank you. Yeah man. But I forgot. What did you ask me. I forget shit a lot. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4854.2s)]
*  Do you worry about that. No. No. No. My parents. Everybody forget shit. But like maybe you don't. I don't know. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4865.2s)]
*  You eat the alpha brain. I do. And it helps with memory. Well you know the reason why I found what we even invented alpha brain was because I had heard what Bill Romanowski did. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4876.2s)]
*  You know the football player. He created this stuff called Neuro One. I was on this radio show in San Francisco back in the day and one of the co-hosts of the radio show said hey I want you to try this stuff. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4888.2s)]
*  My my my coach Bill Romanowski was like his trainer and his friend or something getting through workouts. I want you to try this. It's a new tropic and he developed it to help with the symptoms that he received from all the concussions that he got from playing football. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4902.2s)]
*  He was having problems with his memory. So he developed this like nutrient blend of things that enhance your memory. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4919.2s)]
*  So that was the first one of those that we ever tried before I did Alpha Brain. It's great shit. Yeah I just had took my first one before we did this. Did you. How's it feel. I'm wondering. I'm trying to think about it. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4926.2s)]
*  I'm like is it helping me because I'm forgetting all this shit but I probably need to keep doing it. Yeah it's that laughing gas week too. That stuff is. Yeah I think that's what it is to be honest with you. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4938.2s)]
*  That's where my memory gets fucked up. I get high in here. I'm like what was I fucking talking about. Exactly. It's really strong weed. That's that Joey Diaz weed. No I gotta love it. Gotta love some weed. Sometimes you gotta dumb yourself down just so. Exactly. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4949.2s)]
*  And sometimes you gotta clear yourself up. Right. Yeah. Best of both worlds. Be the line. Just have to have discipline. Enjoy yourself but have discipline. It's easy to live comfortably. Don't be mad. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4965.2s)]
*  I don't have a lot growing up but the best times are like just being on the move. Doing stuff. Hanging out. So that's life man. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4983.2s)]
*  Do you have a really an idea at any point where you'd like to retire or you'd like to do something else or are you just going to just ride it till the wheels fall off. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=4997.2s)]
*  Yeah obviously I have no choice. I have to bro. Please. Pay my bills and I'll fight. Let's go. And pay them good too. Pay better bills. Big bills. I got monthly shit. Yearly expenses. But I'm making good money. It's alright. And it's getting better. So that'll come. I'm down to fight. Man I earned it after all these years of doing it. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5013.2s)]
*  Well you definitely earned it. And you definitely earned a large fan base. I mean that's really what it's all about. People know when they go to see Mike Perry fight especially now after these bare knuckle fights they know they're going to see some wild shit. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5041.2s)]
*  There's guys in the UFC that have been there much longer than me and don't have more fights than me. I had 15 fights in five years. And all UFC fights. Top guy. Top 15 guys. And you know it was like a lesson. It was like learning how to be a martial artist. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5053.2s)]
*  And you know and I've earned the right to compete against other great competitors in history for spectacles and you know competitions. Try to beat these guys in rules that are written on paper. Whatever the rules say. I don't care whatever it is. Let's fight man. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5073.2s)]
*  There's great guys out there too. It's like the more bodies you get to work with you pick up off of each one. But it is a long road and sometimes I'm like alright. That's where I say fighting is a choice where it's like well I could just beat you. I'll just finish you right away and then I don't have to get in this long drag out fight. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5097.2s)]
*  I just take you out. Quit. And it's over. So I can do that in competition and get paid for it. And the rest of the time really I'm just you just you know work out. Enjoy your workout. And then you know I only fight for something that makes a difference now. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5121.2s)]
*  It's like I can either beat you or and it does it benefits me or there's no reason to fight. There's no reason to train. And I know how to win. So it's like I don't need to add to my own attrition. You know some people like those young boxers who have 200 fights. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5141.2s)]
*  Some of them kids are out there. They're not coming back. Right. You know so I've always been fortunate to have battles and hard shots are being thrown. But I've been able to keep control of my mind. Enough I guess. I need to be smarter though. I need to read more books man. I really got to read. I say read more books like I've ever read a book like. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5166.2s)]
*  I read like a Goosebumps book when I was 11 and that was it. What about books on tape. Have you ever listened to like. No. Your books are for that. I listen to like two hours. Audio books are a great way to do it because it's passive and podcast. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5191.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5210.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5240.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5244.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5248.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5252.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5256.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5260.2s)]
*  I'm trying to figure it out. I was thinking that a conversation is like a map and if you take the time [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5264.2s)]
*  You know the map [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5270.88s)]
*  That you they call it, you know, that's why it's called spelling [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5273.679999999999s)]
*  because it's magic and you built you draw on this map which are words and that the map leads to path and treasure and [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5277.84s)]
*  You know, there's opportunities in life on your map [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5287.28s)]
*  So your words are what make things happen business sit down shoot the shit talk [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5291.0s)]
*  genius fucking talking on [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5298.36s)]
*  Comedy stage is that really the origin of the word spelling? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5300.76s)]
*  That's what Bruce Lee says I don't disagree with that. But uh, yeah, it's something like that. That's [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5305.6s)]
*  Bruce Lee says that's crazy. It's it's magic. Your words are that's why it's called spelling. It's a spell [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5311.6s)]
*  For real, what is the origin? What does it say the origin of the word is? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5319.200000000001s)]
*  That sounds insane. Oh my god, imagine we just like figured something out [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5323.64s)]
*  Bruce Lee said well, so [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5331.04s)]
*  the mid 15th century the etymology of the word spell is the action of speaking of and utterance and [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5334.360000000001s)]
*  Then the meaning is putting that into letters, but wow [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5342.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm I mean back in the mid 15th century when they're talking about spells, that's you know, so back then just when they said [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5345.96s)]
*  spelling so the the action of reading letter by letter [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5354.04s)]
*  from the noun spell [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5359.4800000000005s)]
*  But the noun spell when it isn't that like [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5363.72s)]
*  Click on that because would that be like how to spell things out or was it like a magic spell? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5366.700000000001s)]
*  Is there a different kind of spell? That's where I mean [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5371.860000000001s)]
*  The English word spell has to be developed from wherever it came from, you know, and that's where this is gonna go get into and [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5376.22s)]
*  I it's yeah, it's a short form way to say he's right. I'm pretty sure so maybe when they say to cast a spell [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5382.22s)]
*  That's what a lot of people's I have friends that say exactly what he was saying like be careful [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5390.94s)]
*  Would you say out loud because you're casting a spell as soon as you say it? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5396.139999999999s)]
*  Sure wonder how much that is real. I feel like I've lost, you know the path to fights and [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5399.82s)]
*  I've [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5407.46s)]
*  The fight is one. It seems like it's one before you ever step foot in the ring and then or [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5408.98s)]
*  You know, it's not going right something something in adding up some I'm messing up somewhere just mentally and [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5414.98s)]
*  You know and how to beat you in these rule sets and [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5425.0199999999995s)]
*  Like it comes out in the fight [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5429.179999999999s)]
*  And I've had you know tough fights where I lost before the fight even started [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5431.5s)]
*  I'm like it just seemed like I was supposed to lose [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5436.98s)]
*  It just seemed like I was supposed to win it was too easy when I won or when you know, it's like [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5440.26s)]
*  It's someone else is in control [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5449.22s)]
*  A lot of the times I try to you know, make sure [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5452.34s)]
*  I'm the one in control and that's how I've been thinking [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5456.38s)]
*  since having success and fights and [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5460.58s)]
*  new sport and [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5464.02s)]
*  but [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5466.42s)]
*  Ultimately, I just feel like there's another driving force that kind of makes things happen and [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5468.66s)]
*  no control over it and [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5475.5s)]
*  It's either enjoyable or it's a lesson. I have to get through [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5477.74s)]
*  So [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5485.42s)]
*  So you think that like everything that comes up every hurdle that comes up is is a lesson for you [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5488.54s)]
*  Is that how you yeah, absolutely right and [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5494.42s)]
*  You know, I hope I hope that those I [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5497.780000000001s)]
*  Don't need to have training for a lesson where? [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5502.38s)]
*  Someone attacks us in public. I don't you know, I don't have any experience in that [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5506.1s)]
*  I have three bare-knuckle boxing fights. I don't have any experience and being attacked on the street and I don't want any [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5510.62s)]
*  You know, it's a weird thing like people's [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5516.820000000001s)]
*  People have a [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5521.02s)]
*  Weird attachments to like fate the idea that you have a fate. Mm-hmm [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5522.94s)]
*  But I wonder why they I wonder why people resist that I wonder why people think that's not real. I wonder why [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5528.74s)]
*  because in some ways [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5536.46s)]
*  Even if it was real, how the fuck would you know? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5539.0199999999995s)]
*  How would you know you would have no idea but in some ways it seems like it behaves like it's real at least in some way [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5541.7s)]
*  mmm, like that there is kind of a [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5549.099999999999s)]
*  Way that it's all you feel like you've ever died before and then woke up and you were a different person [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5552.9s)]
*  But you're the same person, but I mean you've been growing for years [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5558.74s)]
*  You thought here's the thing you never know because you go to sleep every night [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5562.32s)]
*  You used to look like a different human when yeah, you've been in [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5566.82s)]
*  You've been so young for so many years [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5571.42s)]

*  Bright that's the most healthy. That's where I'm lucky. I get to exercise [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5602.42s)]

*  Some people swear by it. They might be right. I just didn't have good experience with it, but it might have been [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5811.68s)]
*  I only did it with one guy. I mean maybe some people are better at it, but deep tissue massage has always helped [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5817.68s)]
*  No, that helps that helps a lot. I could sit there for six hours and let [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5823.8s)]
*  Know I think that's that's really important like when you get knotted up [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5828.08s)]
*  And yeah, that's why I worry about your neck like there might be something chronic in there [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5832.24s)]
*  But I feel like it always does it comes back and you have to PT it and you work [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5836.599999999999s)]
*  But that's I mean the stem cells definitely a part of that for some people you ever use an iron neck [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5841.5599999999995s)]
*  Like a workout machine no, it's it's not like a it's a halo that you put on your head [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5848.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it has a like turn [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5852.32s)]
*  It really helps [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5857.48s)]
*  Yes, and you control the resistance in how much effort you want to go inside the side [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5859.719999999999s)]
*  So you're not putting pressure on the discs because you're not bending like this [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5865.5599999999995s)]
*  Which some people think could if you do it wrong could fuck you up [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5869.719999999999s)]
*  But this is different because your neck is always straight up and down and you just strengthening all the muscles [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5873.36s)]
*  Well like working on your range of motion with this halo [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5878.44s)]
*  I'll get you one. I think we have them here. Don't we have them here. I think there's still [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5881.719999999999s)]
*  We still have a couple yeah, I'll get you one [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5885.72s)]
*  You'll like it. It's great [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5887.72s)]
*  And it maybe that will help you too [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5889.72s)]
*  Because I know a lot of people that have had neck problems and they do it slowly and it strengthens the muscles around that area [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5891.72s)]
*  Maybe creates because of the resistance creates a little bit of more range of motion [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5895.72s)]
*  You know, yeah, that's why I need something. Do you ever do you ever do yoga or anything like that to stretch out? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5899.72s)]
*  I used to man. Yeah P90x back in the day. Oh, okay back in the day [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5905.72s)]
*  Yoga is I don't know with the boxing I like to be tight sometimes right like before a fight [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5911.8s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be having to get massaged up [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5918.68s)]
*  You like to be tight. I like to earn that tension. Yeah in the gym. I work on it, but I [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5922.12s)]
*  Feel like I earn the pain and then [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5928.6s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, and then I don't know it just I've worked through it. That's what I'm supposed to do [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5931.88s)]
*  Yeah, your mentality is very unique that's interesting [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5937.72s)]
*  I have no choice, bro. But what if it helped you perform better if you got it massaged out? [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5942.200000000001s)]
*  You could be too loose if you're too loose you're not as fast really yeah [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5951.160000000001s)]
*  That's what I believe [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5957.320000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot of very fast [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5960.12s)]
*  I don't know if you're doing it too fast [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5962.12s)]
*  I believe um, but there's a lot of very I know some boxers some coaches are like [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5964.36s)]
*  I don't know a good boxing coach before their fighter boxes. They're like hitting them on the neck with stuff [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5972.84s)]
*  Or like little hits some do like a rub like right before which is weird to me [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5979.8s)]
*  Right. I would honestly be like don't fucking touch me before we go out there and work like I have this [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5985.96s)]
*  When I have a fight an event I have to create this aura that fucking a force field that pushes [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5991.96s)]
*  You know my way through things and [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=5999.32s)]
*  Like when me and connor McGregor faced off [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6003.32s)]
*  He was moving all over the place and I stood my ground I stood so still [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6007.719999999999s)]
*  I stood still and I couldn't be [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6015.8s)]
*  You know wavered or moved [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6018.12s)]
*  He's moving all over the place [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6022.12s)]
*  I mean that says that he was free in that moment to do so obviously [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6024.92s)]
*  But it was me respectfully [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6030.68s)]
*  Calling him out which shows the [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6033.56s)]
*  The professional in martial arts that I have been for so many years [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6036.52s)]
*  How do you call a man out in a sport that you know he has a family and [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6040.52s)]
*  You know you guys want to hurt each other and they can honor it in a fair way and [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6045.639999999999s)]
*  Promote it to be entertaining. I mean everything he does people watch that shit [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6051.08s)]
*  So it was great to have him there. It really boosted the moment for me [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6055.88s)]
*  Listen if he decided to do that [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6061.16s)]
*  If somehow or another they gave him the green light to do that [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6063.48s)]
*  I did I can't imagine how that could ever happen, but if it did [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6066.599999999999s)]
*  If that happened [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6071.8s)]
*  If that happened in in a bare knuckle fight, that would be fucking bananas [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6074.04s)]
*  That would be bananas [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6080.2s)]
*  That would be he's a good kicker too. He kicked cowboy sarone and then he'll fucking yanked my arm [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6081.72s)]
*  Yeah, he's a very good kicker. He's a very good kicker. He he could do everything [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6087.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean if if somehow or another he agreed to fight bare knuckle me, Jesus christ, you know how big that would be? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6091.88s)]
*  My lord mike [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6100.52s)]
*  No, you versus he practices it [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6103.4800000000005s)]
*  And that yeah, he beat a guy who got me [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6106.6s)]
*  So that would it's a great fight man. That would be wild. It'd be cool, man [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6109.8s)]
*  They say it's the pink panty night now because I released a video on instagram me eating my girlfriend's panty [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6114.4400000000005s)]
*  And uh, if they did that in bare knuckle it would get a million pay-per-view bias at least [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6121.96s)]
*  I [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6127.64s)]
*  Don't know how many so what was he saying to you? Uh [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6136.84s)]
*  Fair play to you, man respect you. I love the way he talks [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6142.68s)]
*  I fight you no problem. Hey, that's okay [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgXgCpfECBo&t=6147.72s)]
