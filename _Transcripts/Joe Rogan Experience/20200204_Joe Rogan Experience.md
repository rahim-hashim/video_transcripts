# Joe Rogan Experience #1422 - Lex Fridman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIcQwDkcaWk)
*  Go
*  three two one
*  Lex handsome as ever. Thank you. Well dressed always feel like a slobbing them around you
*  Do you dress like that in real life or only when you do podcasts? Yeah, so I have two outfits this and
*  Black shirt and jeans slick outfit. There's nothing nothing more classic than a dark suit
*  With a white shirt and a black tie. Is that a black tie or is it a dark blue?
*  Black tie black tie black suit black tie. It's armor. Yes makes me feel
*  Like focuses the mind mmm like a professional. Yeah, yeah taking this seriously. Yes. Yes. Yes
*  Like you're you're fucking for real man. You got notes and shit. Yeah, I got notes and shit, but I
*  But given this suit like I like to get like dirty like I like to work in a car or whatever
*  I don't want to like I'd love to get in the fight in this it's this isn't like me trying to protect myself from the
*  From the messiness of the real world. Oh, I understand. This is just looks good. Just makes you feel good
*  Is it um?
*  Flexible like you know, they make clothes their flex. Yeah, you can move in it. I can move in it
*  Oh, that's nice. I can I mean
*  You showed me how you can choke me last time with the tie. Did you get a breakaway tie? No, I didn't but you know
*  I kind of let you have that one because I think I can defend it pretty well
*  Well, you're probably very good at defending jokes. Yeah, no no front would like with the tie
*  I don't have a system yet. I'll have to talk to John Donahue to develop a tie
*  But all you have to do man is just take the back of the tie cut it put a little piece of Velcro on each end
*  You got the same tie this nap. No, but I think you
*  Going under the tie to try to start to choke. Mm-hmm
*  Actually, I mean you're making yourself vulnerable like maybe 10 arm bar or something like that like I think there's a silly
*  Don't be silly. Well, listen if someone grabs a hold of your collar, that's the same thing. Yeah, Ezekiel chokes are deadly
*  Yeah, but it's not over. Yeah, if you sink it in mm-hmm, but it's so
*  Collars are real problem
*  Right in jujitsu. Yeah, they're a real problem if someone gets deep on your collar like someone on this with a suit
*  I'm gonna start doing this man. You're fucked
*  Not good
*  Not good collars are not good if you go deep if you get in deep. Yeah. Yeah. Well
*  The problem with that is it's a handle
*  It's worse than a collar because I'll get underneath that knot and I grab a hold of that bitch and then it's all just twisting
*  Yeah, but you have to
*  You're right. Yeah, I would have to get it. I'd have to get it
*  You also kind of have to hold on to this part because it can loosen naturally unless you're really good at like
*  Because it loosens doesn't yeah, it loosens naturally this is a system to this I think
*  You don't think I have
*  Do not try to choke people with ties on as friends. Yeah, I'm like, let me grab a hold that tie real quick
*  I'm like what happens if I do this? Yeah, no, no, not you get to people and also probably a joke
*  Yeah, yeah fighting for my life. I think it'd be different. We sure you're a tough guy. You are actually trained martial artists
*  I mean, I'm not saying it would be easy to grab your tie and choke you to death
*  What I'm saying is it's one more area of vulnerability that doesn't need to exist
*  But see I'm disagreeing with you and saying like if I was gonna fight to the death. I
*  Would wear this suit. Okay, cuz I would look good. Let me tell you something about CIA agents and Secret Service guys
*  They wear breakaway ties
*  That's because they're not good martial artists. Oh, that's not true. There's a lot of those guys are savages. Are they fuck?
*  Yeah, man, who belts or no black belts man
*  If you're a fucking if you're a Secret Service guy, you're supposed to be protecting the president
*  I guarantee you a bunch of those guys are savages. I think they're smart enough to use guns that too
*  Yeah, but they don't you know if they have to wear a tie a lot of people like to wear breakaway ties
*  Is that a fact? Mm-hmm. I might be making this up right now. That's a bro. No, I know but it's it's a little bro fact
*  But only like 10% I think let's Google
*  breakaway ties for self-defense
*  because
*  Dude, look, I'm definitely a dummy right? Okay, I think about this stuff too much
*  But when I was driving limos, I always felt super vulnerable when I had to wear that tie
*  It looks good though my one of my
*  Actually, my first album my first real album that I ever did for Warner Brothers was in
*  1999 and I wore exactly that outfit
*  I wore a black suit with a white shirt and a white and a black tie and it looked dope
*  That's called I'm gonna be dead someday. I get a breakaway time a stand-up like
*  Look at that breakaway tie son low pro breakaway tie. Whoa, that's what I'm wearing
*  Let me explain you something come get some most people when they're vulnerable like say I'm afraid I'm gonna be picked on by bullies
*  I learned a martial art how to defend myself. Yes you when you felt vulnerable wearing a tie
*  Decided not to wear a tie as opposed to learn how to defend yourself while wearing a tie
*  There must be a system. I guarantee you
*  You could you could say that you could defend yourself you had a dog collar on your neck too, but I wouldn't recommend it
*  I wouldn't recommend it. I
*  Took my dog out once I
*  Had a pit bull and he bit my cat. He grabbed a hold of my cat. It's a terrible story
*  I had a crazy dog one of my dogs was a
*  Dog that I had gotten it was I was young and irresponsible in my 20s and I gotten this dog that was
*  Bred from a pig hunting dog in Hawaii and those dogs are
*  Hyper animal aggressive. They're great with people. He was great with people
*  He loved people but everything that moved he was like locked in on he would spend his days in my yard chasing lizards
*  His thing was to jump up on the wall of house and try to snatch lizards
*  It was like a video game for him and my friend Eddie was terrified of this dog. Hey Bravo
*  Yeah, and so Eddie would come over the house and Frank would just decide that he runs shit when Eddie's around because Eddie was so
*  Scared of him. He'd be like, hmm, I think I'm gonna kill this cat
*  Just tried to kill my cat and I got a hold of him in time and I got my hand into his collar and I
*  Said like that. Yeah, I just dug behind. Yeah from behind. I just dug my hand under his collar and I trusted I put him to sleep
*  He went right out. It's crazy. Yeah, it works works on dogs
*  Yeah, maybe from the bow wasn't thinking from the back I was thinking from the front but from anywhere you can grab a dog
*  Collar if you get your hand in there if you're strong enough and you have good technique, you know
*  I had to go neon belly and then you twist it you can put a dog to sleep. Well, you've changing my mind
*  See, yeah, but I don't know. I mean look obviously you're gonna be aware of that and you're gonna defend and you get it
*  But it's a it's an area of vulnerability
*  Pull up
*  1990 and pull up I'm gonna be dead someday that the cover that because I'm literally dressed exactly like you on the cover or
*  when actually doing the show
*  No, I never wore it doing a show. I think I just wore it for the cover
*  Almost ironically. No, I kind of like the way it looks just you know, there it is. Bam
*  It's hard to tell there because it's that one's orange and the other one's hot pink
*  But it's like the the the shirt collar is a little more open like like you don't give a damn
*  Well, that was a long day and there was a long photo shoot. We were drinking. Yeah
*  There's a legit there was a lot of stuff going on there but it was
*  Just to just I just I like that look. It's good. Look by the way
*  Congratulations on the ten years. Oh, thank you very much. I don't think you've celebrated
*  All I see is on Jamie's Instagram
*  Like a naked picture of Bert
*  Ten year picture. Yeah, we probably should do something. It was December was officially ten years
*  So it's two months ago. I just have some sort of a party or something
*  I know you don't like to talk about it think about it, but you've inspired millions
*  It's very nice. It's very it's a very nice side effect, but it's a it's a weird gig man
*  You know and it's a it's a gig that became what it is
*  Slowly without me understanding what was happening while it was happening which makes it weirder and weirder and with it has come increasingly
*  Like stronger levels of responsibility
*  To where you know now I have to actually vet guests and think about what they're saying whereas before I would have someone on it
*  They're crazy. I was like let that crazy motherfucker
*  I don't hear what he has to say and people would say a lot of crazy shit and then they would say oh
*  You know you didn't push back or you had this person on and they they said something irresponsible
*  And I had no idea what they were gonna say
*  There's a lot of people that have said some pretty outrageous things that I had no idea they were gonna say yeah
*  I saw the like I started one of the things you inspired me to do is to start a podcast on
*  artificial intelligence and I have Jack Dorsey as a guest coming up aha and
*  That's a good example of somebody you got like an insane amount of pushback
*  Yes, because they were mad that I didn't talk to him about censorship, but my my take on it was
*  It was
*  Certainly irresponsible on my part the first podcast because my take on it was I just want to see what it's like to be a guy
*  That starts this thing and it becomes probably one of the most important conversation
*  tools the world's ever known and
*  Also along the way
*  becomes
*  You know it becomes something we like right now. It's weird like Twitter now. It's just
*  It's just
*  50% hot dumpster fire
*  You know it's so much amazing inspiring stuff like you can always find the dumpster fire and all kinds of conversations
*  Yes, and the confusing thing to me about your conversation with Jack, which I didn't look at the internet
*  Before I listened to it, and I really enjoyed it. I was interesting
*  I learned a lot from your first conversation with Jack and like and then I looked at the internet
*  That told me I'm supposed to hate that conversation and what I'm confused about is
*  Why why there's such?
*  Like why is there such hatred thrown towards?
*  I also talked to the head of the YouTube head of the YouTube algorithm search and discovery a lot of hate towards YouTube
*  yeah, a lot of hate towards Twitter a lot towards Facebook and
*  Deservedly so there's some challenges and so on but they're doing like an incredible service and the algorithm
*  They're trying to develop and control is really hard to develop a control
*  Yes, so sure so the pushback that people get it's almost like they're ignoring there
*  They're taking specific
*  anecdotal pieces of evidence or look this person said this and it's
*  It's not that problematic in our eyes, but they somehow got sensitive from the platform removed from the platform and
*  They don't look at the bigger picture of how challenging the entirety of it is and how incredible
*  first of all the incredible the platform is to have a conversation like a global conversation like this and
*  How hard it is to do to achieve the goal of having it sounds like cheesy?
*  but having like a healthy conversation a healthy discourse because
*  You want an algorithm and a platform that removes the assholes?
*  from the scene because
*  It's a really difficult
*  Challenge because you want this is one person who's really loud is screaming in the room like comes to the party
*  You have a cool party a bunch of cool people some communists some right-wingers. Whatever. It doesn't matter
*  They can all disagree, but they're not assholes
*  They're there to have a like interesting debate conversation so on and then there's somebody that comes with like a and just start screaming
*  Like one like slogan or something like that or is trying is trolling is completely sort of non-genuine in their way of communication
*  They're destroying the nature of the conversation and then of course that person if they get
*  You know the bodyguards come in and say can you please leave the party sir?
*  Then they get extremely that's exactly the kind of personality that's extremely upset
*  Mm-hmm and there's sometimes they almost look for that so what you're supposed to do as a jackdaw is a
*  As a leader of that kind of platform. It's a very good question
*  And I really think that there's no real answer and it's one of the reasons why it's so frustrating
*  You know if you just let people say whatever they want whenever they want to
*  There's gonna be a lot of people that get turned off
*  To that kind of a platform because you're gonna have a lot of people yelling out racial slurs
*  ethnic slurs
*  gender slurs
*  homophobic slurs
*  There's gonna be a bunch of people that are trolling
*  There's gonna be a bunch of people that just say things to rile people up
*  And that's all they do there's gonna be a bunch of people that just want to shit stir and they want to dox people
*  No, so they got it then you have to set parameters like what are the parameters don't you can't dox people you can't
*  Don't say racial slurs. Don't say ethnic slurs
*  It's you're managing at scale and you're managing an insane amount of people
*  But then there's legitimate criticism that they lean towards
*  progressive people and liberal people and
*  They they have woke politics like for instance you can get banned from Twitter
*  For life if you dead name someone so Lex if you became
*  Female and you change your name to Ally and I said fuck you man your Lex
*  Banned for life. That's what a dead naming. That's dead naming
*  Like if you wanted to call
*  Caitlyn Jenner if you want to call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce on Twitter you would get dead named
*  Or you would be dead naming her and you would get banned for life a woman named Megan Murphy who is a turf
*  Do you know the turf is?
*  What do you think? I don't know the turf is I'm sure you don't you're too balls deep in science. Yeah turf is trans exclusionary
*  radical feminists
*  so trans exclusionary
*  Why don't have such a hard time with that word?
*  exclusionary right
*  Exclusion it why does it sound wrong?
*  exclusionary sounds wrong
*  What does it mean to be exclusionary to trans
*  They she did. Okay turf's do not want trans people
*  To be to have a say in women's issues
*  I see they think that they are a different thing that there's women and women's issues and these feminists
*  That have been female their whole life dealing with women's issues
*  Do not want trans people coming in and in many cases
*  What you find is that trans people come in and
*  Then the conversation changes and it becomes about trans issues and they want these conversations to be about women's issues in in feminist movements
*  It's complicated right she got banned from Twitter for life for saying a man is never a woman
*  They made her take the tweet down so she took a screenshot of it took it down and then put the screenshot back up and
*  Then they banned it for life should she get banned no no she shouldn't because
*  Biologically she's correct if there's an argument there if there's an argument a scientific argument a man is never a woman
*  But can a man identify as a woman and should you respect them?
*  Her then and treat them as a woman yes, so yes, so the question is whether I mean I
*  I'm not too deep into thinking about these specific issues
*  But the question is whether you should get banned for being an asshole you should get banned for being
*  For lying because I think lying is okay
*  Whatever that's a lot of people lie on Twitter. Yeah, I and sort of or
*  Insult you can insult people on Twitter as long as you're not specific about their gender see that the insult thing
*  That's where it gets. It's the party thing you have the
*  asshole douchebag whatever term you want to use they show up to the party and then
*  If a person shows up to the party and a lot of people leave because they're annoying or whatever yes
*  That should be like we should do something to discourage that behavior. That's a good point however
*  Let's let's paint a different picture of a party. Let's have a party where everyone says my pronouns are they them and
*  Zizer and ja vu and and then you come in you come on, bro. You're a guy and like no no no
*  I'm a they fucking
*  Cisgendered
*  Heteronormative piece of shit, and then they want to kick you out of the party
*  Yeah, all you're saying is you're a guy ban both of them no way
*  Ban the ban the person who's not open-minded or respectful for the you know
*  Don't ban people here's here's no no no no not the yeah, so of course has been well documented by
*  But by people now the reason we probably have the current president is
*  Yeah, the people on the left are very also rude and disrespectful
*  It's a small percentage of the people in the very small. This is part of the real issue on Twitter
*  They are all on Twitter, but it's also the small percentage
*  when you
*  It's so hard to have a group and call that group the left
*  because
*  The variables are so extreme. There's so many different people that follow
*  Politics or that that espoused to certain belief systems that
*  Recognize themselves as left funny enough. You're probably on the left. Yes. I'm very much on the left
*  Yeah, but I don't get considered to be on the left because I'm a cage-fighting commentator
*  Yeah, you know American flag behind yeah, I'm very bro ish. I hunt a bow hunt
*  Which is even more bro ish right and I am
*  Unabashedly masculine I'm a man and a comedian
*  Yes, I'm a dirty comedian and I said and I make fun of everything including sacred cows like gender
*  homosexuality heterosexuality my own kids my wife my mom
*  Everybody I make fun of everybody and if you take that stuff out of context in just
*  Publish a bunch of it. It makes you look like a moron or it makes you look like an asshole
*  That's you know what what is the left, right?
*  What is the left in my mind the left when I was a child?
*  I always thought of the left because I grew up my parents were hippies
*  All right, my my stepdad was an architect and before that he was a computer programmer
*  He had long hair until I was I think I was 20 years old when he cut his hair
*  I mean long like down to his ass like a Native American nice and he you know
*  They always he smoked pot when I was little. I mean he I
*  Was always around hippies I lived in San Francisco from the time I was seven till I was 11
*  And I was always and and my family was very left-wing. They were always
*  Pro gay marriage. They were pro gay rights pro racial equality pro
*  Just name it man pro welfare pro
*  You know just the idea was open-mindedness
*  Education all these things are good and this is and war was bad and you know, there's a lot of
*  You know, there's a lot of things that maybe
*  they had that
*  They had they had like very strong beliefs on that. Maybe they weren't
*  Entirely nuanced on as well when you find that about people on the left as much as you find that about people on the right
*  but it's
*  The radicals on both sides being there's nothing wrong with being conservative right there's nothing wrong with valuing hard work
*  There's nothing wrong with someone who values
*  fiscal frugality or someone who is you know, you you have a
*  conservative view on
*  Economics or on social policies, you know and you you want less government. There's nothing wrong with those things either
*  That's when you get extreme like yeah, the guest was amazing guess yet recently
*  They converted a bunch of folks from the KKK. Darrell Davis. Yeah. Wow. This is him right here. This is a CD
*  He's amazing. He's a incredible human man, but that kind of thinking I wish you saw that more than yeah
*  It's sort of like not even if you're on the left to be to talk to people on the right
*  Instead of just shut him out. That's the problem with this idea of kicking people out of the party
*  You kick people out of the party guys like Darrell Davis never get to convert them
*  There's been people from Twitter that have been converted, you know, Megan Phelps is a famous one
*  She was a part of the Westboro Baptist Church
*  Her grandfather was Fred Phelps that fucking famous crazy asshole who was like super rude like who you know would make them
*  take those signs and say God hates fags and and literally go to soldiers funerals and say that soldiers died
*  Because God is angry that people are homosexual
*  So Megan was completely entrenched in this toxic ideology
*  Twitter allowed her to escape that ideology
*  She met her husband on Twitter from arguing his thing back and forth and now she's out and now and now and you if you
*  Talk to her you would never believe it and man and not that long ago either
*  Not that long ago she was in that church like six years ago. It's kind of incredible that you can sort of grow that
*  Mindset so no matter I mean that's inspiring that you can hold the mindset of hatred and now I'll yes escape it
*  Well, she was indoctrinated into it from the time she was a child and you know for her
*  it was the only life she knew right her family is in that and
*  for her she just
*  Just I mean by whatever for whatever grace of the Grand Universe plan
*  She had enough open-mindedness to take into consideration some of these other things that people are saying
*  We have a problem today with cancel culture. It's a real problem
*  Is that you just want to write people off well those people still exist
*  It's basically a cultural form of euthanasia
*  You just want to go out and whack everyone who doesn't agree with you, but if you if you do that
*  You whether it's eugenics or whatever whatever you want to call it you just eliminate everyone who's not the way that you like
*  Culturally eliminate them take them out of the conversation. They still exist. Yeah, they still exist. So what happens then well, then they're angry
*  They're angry. They're left out of the conversation and and they don't grow and then you've written them off as a human being you said that
*  They're they're a hundred percent bad now if you had a spectrum of people in this world
*  100% bad and 100% good. I mean there are some beautiful people that really are a hundred percent
*  Like my friend Justin Ren who runs fight for the forgotten charity
*  He's about as close to a hundred percent good as you can get
*  I mean this beautiful person goes to the Congo and makes
*  Wells for the pygmies and gets malaria
*  He's now he's got some crazy parasite now that they don't even know what it is. They can't recognize it
*  He's been suffering for eight months now, I think
*  That's about as good as you can get right and then there's people, you know, you could well
*  It's a gray area when you start to drift away from the good
*  I have the same thing in my like that's the focus I have in the academic setting of science
*  There's and that's that's the inspiration of your podcast that you you gave me is to talk outside
*  The people that are sort of conventionally accepted by the scientific community like a little bit on the fringes
*  Yeah, and the quote-unquote fringes. So you have the same thing in machine learning and artificial intelligence
*  There's people that are working on specific. It's called deep learning these learning methodologies that are accepted
*  You know, there's conferences and we all kind of accept the problems we're working on and there's people a little bit on the fringes
*  There's people in neuroscience
*  Actually anybody thinking about working on what's called artificial general intelligence is already on the fringes
*  Yeah, if you even raise the question, okay, so how do we build human level intelligence? That's a little bit of a taboo subject the
*  Consciousness it's called the c-word for a while consciousness. Really? Yeah. Well, it's the scientists. I know I understand
*  Yeah, but explain it to me like what what's the aversion? What is everyone worried about?
*  Well, no, it's
*  What are they worried about?
*  it's this culture of
*  Rolling your eyes the same the same way you might roll your eyes if somebody tells you the earth is flat. Mm-hmm
*  They they sort of put all other things in that category as well. It's like well, that's okay
*  Whatever that's we so in the case of consciousness
*  we really don't understand very much at all what consciousness is what the
*  With the you know the subjective experience the fact that it feels like something to take in the world that it's not just
*  Raw sensory information being processed actually feels like to touch something to taste something to see something
*  It's like incredible
*  David Chalmers calls it the hard problem of consciousness. Why do we feel it? Okay, but we don't have scientific physics
*  engineering methods of studying consciousness
*  So
*  It immediately gets put into this bin that it's not an okay thing like you're a little bit of a crazy
*  Off the reservation. I think somebody was Darrell saying that's a slur. I never even thought of that
*  I didn't think of what that meant
*  Yeah
*  so they already put in this bin of you're not a legitimate researcher and the same kind of
*  You know, and I think we're now in a in a culture which is great, you know, Eric Weinstein is good at this
*  I'm hoping to be good at this you're good at this at allowing those people on the fringes in and saying what are your ideas?
*  Exploring those yeah, of course you have a greater and greater platform to where there is a line. You don't want too far in the fringes
*  Yeah, that's
*  Something I'm aware of now
*  That I wasn't aware of say like three or four years ago and I used to have a lot of those
*  I've had some people on that I would never have on again
*  You know and and then I've had some people on that I've been criticized for having them on like
*  Okay, I see why you are upset
*  But I think there's value in having conversations with people that are on the fringes
*  There's people that are bad faith actors, right?
*  They act in bad faith
*  Those are the ones you have to be careful of and sometimes you don't know who they are until you get to know them
*  Yeah, and then you've already kind of opened the door like for some people for like the Democratic the legitimate
*  Seven-year-old plus Democratic Party Tulsi Gabbard is on the fringe. Yeah, right, but I think
*  You having her on is great is exploring, you know
*  She's one of the young minds exploring sort of the role of the United States the foreign policy in the world
*  Militarily in terms of trade and so on so she's an excellent mind who I don't think is on the fringe
*  And same I don't think she's on the fringe Bernie Sanders for many people still is on the fringe
*  Yeah, and I think he gets misrepresented though
*  One of the things that was
*  Tremendously beneficial for me is to sit down with him for hours and have a conversation
*  And you go oh, you're a real person. You're not this wacky guy yelling about billionaires
*  Well, you know when you get these 90-second sound bites and these debates you don't get a chance to know who someone is
*  Yeah, so I used to listen to this
*  I listened to a lot of radio on the left and the right to try to get like taken
*  What what people are thinking about I used to listen to this program?
*  I think it's called the Tom Hartman program. He's like a
*  Major lefty, but he had this segment called brunch with Bernie
*  and he would invite Bernie Sanders like every Friday or something like that and
*  Just sort of the intellectual honesty and curiosity that Bernie exhibited was just fascinating sort of like
*  As opposed to being a political
*  Thing that just repeats the same message over and over which actually what it kind of sounds like when you listen to him now publicly
*  He's actually a thinking individual and somebody who's open and changing his mind
*  But within that is just completely been consistent
*  What people are terrified of is that he's going to raise taxes on successful people and ruin business
*  Yeah, that's what people are worried about that that in doing that it will crash the economy. Yes. I don't know if they're right
*  I don't even know if they're so first of all the people are using the word socialist
*  Yeah saying he's a socialist. Do you really want socialism?
*  America is a great country because we're a capitalist kind of thing
*  From my perspective, I think we already have a huge number of socials. Well, he's a democratic socialist democratic social
*  It's a different perspective. He just values workers the idea is he wants people to earn a living wage
*  He wants people to not be indebted with the tremendous amount of student loan debt when you're just
*  21 years old and getting out of college. He thinks it's insane and I agree with him
*  He doesn't want people to be burdened in this insane way if you ever get sick and I agree with them
*  I think improve the health care system
*  I think as a community if we're looking at the United States as a community one of things that you know
*  Look, it's great to support business. It's great to have a strong economy
*  It's great to give business the confidence to take chances and a lot of people think Donald Trump does that
*  It's also great to take care of our own and I don't think we do that enough
*  I don't think we take care of our own enough in terms of
*  We have the same problems in the same inner cities that we've had for decade after decade after decade and there's no
*  Significant attempt to change that but meanwhile we do these nation-building
*  projects in other countries and we have the
*  Inter-Venetialist foreign policy where we go in and invade these countries and try to prop up new
*  New governments and try to support them and we spend insane amounts of money doing that and
*  Along the while we don't do anything to our inner cities that are the exact same fucked up places that they were in the
*  70s and in the 60s
*  Do you know do you know Michael Wood jr. Is no he was on the podcast a couple times and he used to be a
*  Police officer in Baltimore. Yes, I know him. Okay, so I listen to that podcast. I'm just horrible with names. Okay his
*  his experience was first of all just
*  He found a piece of paper that showed like a crime docket from the 1970s all the stuff like
*  drugs crime robbery
*  It was all the same issues in the same neighborhoods that he was patrolling in today
*  And he was like, holy shit and he realized like oh, this is a quagmire
*  And then he found out about the laws that were in place from way back in the day where
*  You literally if you were an African American you couldn't buy a home in certain areas. They had what is that term?
*  Is it redlined? Is that what the term is where they?
*  they designate certain areas where they literally won't sell homes to black people and
*  he was becoming aware of this shit as he was a cop and
*  You know in the beginning he was all gung-ho. He's like, I'm a cop
*  You know, I'm here to bust bad guys and do the right thing and then along the way he kind of recognized
*  You're dealing with systemic racism
*  Red line really? Yeah, so yeah, so that hasn't been addressed. It's all about I mean, there's a million other things at home education
*  Yeah, I think all those things. I think Bernie Sanders when he talks about those things
*  He he seems like a guy who really cares about
*  education healthcare and
*  People that live in poverty. Yeah, I don't I don't know if he's gonna be able to do anything
*  I don't know that's the main thing is like people say Democratic Socialists and so on is gonna
*  He's going to make a slight move into the whatever direction
*  He's trying to advocate which in this case is more investment into the infrastructure and so on into our yeah at home
*  But like, you know, he's just one human being just it has to be a Congress that represents the people and if there's anything
*  I think Congress is probably the most hated entity in all of the universe
*  Like it you look at all the polls of what people like and hate
*  Like rats are above in terms of favorability ratings. So Congress is really the broken system
*  Bernie won't be able to do much except take a little sort of the role of the president as I see it is
*  To one the terrifying one is to start wars and
*  So this it's a very serious responsibility
*  You have to take and the second is to inspire the population in terms of executive power of enacting laws
*  There's not much power all you can all you can do is
*  what our current president is doing sort of
*  Inspiring the on that in that case the Republicans in Congress to sort of
*  Work together to work on certain legislation so you can inspire the Congress and you can inspire the people but you don't have actual direct power
*  So Bernie is not going to turn
*  America into a socialist
*  You know
*  Haven he's going to take a small step into maybe he probably fixing
*  focusing on one aspect like health care or something like that like President Obama did and tried to
*  make a little change and so
*  So in that sense people that are genuine and
*  Have ideas like Andrew Yang is another one. He has like a ridiculous number of ideas
*  I don't know if you've seen like he thinks all cops should be purple belts and jujitsu. Yeah, I like it
*  I'm like go Andrew. Yeah, there's a million other ideas. He's well, he's a genius
*  I mean, he's a brilliant guy and he's an entrepreneur. So he comes at this stuff from a different angle
*  Yeah, you know he's open-minded like I guess I
*  Well, I disagree with him on his
*  Evaluation of the state of artificial intelligence and automation in terms of its capabilities and having an impact on the economy
*  You don't think it's gonna be as much of a deal as he thinks it is on the timescale that he thinks it is
*  but I also want to be careful sort of commenting on that because I think
*  For him. It's a tool to describe
*  the concerns the suffering that people go through in terms of
*  In terms of losing their job like the pain that people are feeling throughout the country
*  It's like a mechanism he uses to talk to people about the future in that, you know
*  There are people that they're well off like the different tech companies that should also contribute to investing our community
*  I mean the specifics I want to kind of sit back and relax a little bit
*  It's like when you watch a sci-fi movie and the details are all really bad. I want to just
*  Suspension or disbelief or whatever and enjoy the movie in the same way the stuff he says about AI
*  He's not very knowledgeable about AI and automation
*  So it's a little it touches me a little bit the wrong way and we're not as far along
*  the the transformative effects of artificial intelligence in terms of replacing humans in trucking autonomous vehicles something I know a couple things about
*  is not going to be as
*  You know, I could speak relatively confidently the the revolution autonomous vehicles would be more gradual than
*  Andrew is describing but that's okay. He has a million other ideas and you'd be I
*  Nevertheless the University of basic income or some kind of support structure of that kind
*  Nevertheless could be a very good idea for people that lose their job for people to be mobile in terms of going for one
*  Type of job to another type of job. So yeah continually learning through our life
*  It's just that artificial intelligence in this case. I don't think will be the enemy. It'd be
*  there could be other things that are a little bit sort of
*  neighbors of artificial intelligence, which is sort of the
*  Software world eating up some of the mechanization of factors and so on
*  you know, maybe
*  Maybe the the fact that you know the kind of way that Tesla and Elon Musk are approaching
*  the design and
*  Engineering of vehicles that are a little bit more software centric will change
*  Will sort of move some of the job from Detroit, Michigan in terms of cars to the Silicon Valley
*  Not necessarily location wise but sort of a different type of person would need to be hired to work on cars a little bit more software
*  Engineering software centric versus the sort of hardcore
*  mechanical engineers more sort of
*  You know tradition called car guys. Yeah girls, right?
*  Yeah, so that there'll be some job
*  Replacement so on but it's not this artificial intelligence trucks will completely replace a job and in the case of trucks
*  You know that it's not
*  there's a lot of complicated aspects about the impact of automation sort of
*  Trucking jobs, there's actually a lot of
*  need for jobs like there's not
*  the
*  Truck that that job there's already people leaving that job sector. It's a really difficult job. It doesn't pay as well as it should
*  It's really difficult to train people and so on so
*  The the impact that he talks about in terms of AI is a little bit of exaggerated
*  But like I said a million really good ideas. He's open-minded
*  so the in terms of
*  I think the nice role of a president is to have ideas like the purple belt one to inspire people and
*  Inspire Congress to implement some of those ideas and be open-minded and not take yourself seriously enough to think that you know
*  All the right answers and your yang
*  Bernie is like that although Bernie's like 78 years old so
*  Yeah, he's getting up there. Yeah, look at President Tulsi when he kicks the bucket
*  You know what I didn't really think well
*  Yeah, that's so I think Hillary Clinton endorsed Bernie and Tulsi Gabbard for president reverse endorsement
*  accidentally
*  Well, yeah, but I say it's just such a petty thing to say that no one likes Bernie like come on lady
*  This is you're in the twilight of your life
*  I think she's really aware of the fact that if she says something like that people are gonna like Bernie more
*  I think it's an endorsement. I
*  Don't think she has any idea that I think she's super insulated
*  I don't I don't think I think she thinks that she can actually hamstring him by saying something like that
*  And she doesn't understand that it just makes people realize that the things that they say about her are correct
*  Yeah, I don't think negative enough credit really you gave her credit for killing upstein. I
*  Was joking I don't think she did I think building to
*  Somebody did it. I don't know who it was. Maybe some
*  Scientist character maybe he's still alive could be that's what Eddie Bravo thinks
*  Yeah, Eddie Bravo thinks he's in like Dominican Republic somewhere eating bananas and drinking my ties. It's a conspiracy on the conspiracy
*  Yeah, well Eddie's always like that. He's many levels deep. He plays 4d chess when it comes to conspiracies
*  Do you think that Andrew Yang is off?
*  but
*  Ultimately will be correct in terms of the automation timeline. Do you think that maybe?
*  He doesn't know clearly as much as you know about automation and artificial intelligence
*  But do you think that it's possible that you know, I think he's looking at a timeline
*  I think he was thinking within the next ten years right millions and millions of jobs gonna be replaced
*  Do you think that it's more like 20 years or 30 years?
*  But still something exactly concern. So the timeline, of course, nobody knows
*  But I think the timeline is much the time scales is more stretched out
*  So 20 30 years and it'll continue there'll be there'll be certain key revolutions and those revolutions
*  It's a suit. It's an incorrect word to use but they'll be stretched out over time
*  I think the autonomous vehicle revolution is something to achieve a scale of millions of vehicles
*  They're fully autonomously navigating our streets. I think it's 20 30 years away
*  Hmm, and it won't be like all of a sudden. It'll be gradual
*  it'll be people like
*  The former Google self-driving car Waymo company who's doing a lot of testing now incredible engineer
*  I visited them for a day. It'll be expanding their efforts slowly. They're doing also way more trucks autonomous trucking
*  They're already deploying them in Texas
*  I think and then of course Tesla who's this year gonna approach a million
*  Vehicles and they're trying to achieve full stretch self-driving capability, but that's gonna be gradual
*  I just got a new update for the Tesla some new self-driving update it costs four grand
*  And I was like, what is it?
*  You know and then but I think I was high and I was looking at my phone. I was like, hmm, okay
*  Let's do it. And so I got this update, but I'm like, what did I just pay for and I'm not even any
*  I don't even know if I'm gonna use it. I think it can change. I think it does everything
*  I think it changes lanes and yeah, well, okay, so I'm not exactly sure what the update is
*  But it's probably see if you can find out Jamie. So it's probably the quote-unquote full self-driving. Yeah, very important
*  Um the safety person I guess on this podcast
*  Tesla cannot drive itself fully autonomously. You have to keep your eyes on the road
*  I saw a guy sleeping on the internet and he was fine. Yeah, well in a car
*  Cold I'll look into it
*  Was on CNN
*  It was someone filmed the guy he was in his car passed out and not just one
*  It's been there's been a few examples of that people commuting on their way to work out cold
*  So some are for fun and fake but it's certainly a real thing that you pass out and sleep
*  We do that with manual driven cars, too
*  I enjoy driving home in my Tesla from the comic store like one o'clock in the morning hitting that autopilot and
*  I keep my hand on the wheel, but it just it's in a level of relaxation
*  Keep your eyes on the road. Yes. I'm not looking at my phone or anything stupid, but it's just like go doodoo
*  You press that the double button. Yeah, I just ha
*  Changes lanes or it doesn't change lanes. It stays in the lane
*  It does it can change lanes, but I think you have to prompt it
*  like if if you want to like
*  There's an option for navigate on autopilot like it'll like take you everywhere you would need to go
*  Yeah, but I think you need to step in at certain points
*  Yeah, and you actually so now you can it can change lanes without you
*  Pressing that's what it is now. Yeah, so you can do it automatically and they're doing hundreds of thousands
*  I think they're tracking the number of automated lane change first of all
*  Incredible that this is possible. There's hundreds of thousands of automated lane changes without human initiation
*  Happening right now on I mean to me as a sort of a robotics person. That's just incredibly here
*  It is from whole snack on Twitter
*  It says Tesla's new update lets the car recognize traffic cones stop signs and stop lines trash cans and stoplights at their colors
*  If you try to run a stop sign under autopilot the car emergency brakes and forces you to take over after right Wow
*  You can't run stop signs. So this isn't the update you paid four thousand dollars for that's already
*  That's part of that, but I'm actually surprised so the four thousand, but it says Tesla's new update
*  What's the time on this chain with what date December 24th?
*  Okay for more recent so this isn't the exact update the
*  You paid four thousand dollars for I think this is a general part of the full self driving which is four thousand dollars and
*  Just to be clear again safety person
*  It's not like it detects traffic lights
*  But it doesn't stop at the traffic lights for you and maybe in this case it does emergency braking on the south side
*  But it's not not good enough. It's not is not there. Yeah, not there. Don't trust it. It's not there
*  It's in fact this you know, there's a lot of people including myself think it's we're quite a few years away
*  but I'm also sort of also on
*  The podcast just like you got and she has to talk to you almost meet him talk to him in person and realize that there's you
*  know
*  There's people in this world. They can make the impossible happen. You interviewed him as well. Yeah twice
*  Yeah, tell me what was that experience like for you?
*  So
*  You know, it was it's quite incredible in the sense that he is a legit engineer and designer
*  Which is like a pleasure for me. I've talked to a few CEOs talk to Eric Schmidt
*  Just the CEOs and they're a little bit more business oriented
*  Elon is really really focused on the fundamental like the first principles to like the physics level of the problems
*  that are being solved whether that's SpaceX with the fundamentals of rocket reusable rockets and and
*  You know going into deep space and colonizing Mars whether that's in your link
*  Sure the getting to the core the fundamentals of what it's like to have a computer communicate with the human brain and with Tesla
*  On the battery side sort of saying he he threw away a lot of the conventional thinking about what's required to build
*  first of all
*  Appealing car electric car but also one that has a long range. That's something I don't know as much about but then on the AI side
*  Just I mean he boldly said from scratch
*  We can build the system ourselves in a matter of months now a couple of years that's able to drive autonomously
*  I mean most people would laugh at that idea like the most roboticists that know from the DARPA challenges
*  Most of them know how hard this problem is. He said no no, no, we're gonna we're not only gonna throw away LIDAR
*  Which is this laser-based sensor? We're gonna say cameras only and
*  We're gonna use deep learning machine learning which is learning based system
*  So it's a system that learns from scratch and we're gonna teach it to drive from eight cameras and so on
*  so just talking to somebody like that was
*  the not
*  The fact that he thinks like that. I
*  Think it's just fun to talk to people like that. I don't meet them often
*  Let's say no no stop this bullshit of thinking that this task is impossible. Let's say why is it impossible?
*  Is it really impossible?
*  Well, you find out when you start to think about most problems from first principles is that it's not actually impossible
*  And then you have to think okay. So how do we make it happen? How do we create an infrastructure?
*  That allows you to learn from huge amounts of data
*  so one of the most revolutionary things that Tesla is doing and
*  Hopefully other car companies will be doing is the over-the-air software updates
*  Just like the update that you got the fact that just like on your phone
*  You can get updates over time means you can have a learning system a machine learning based system
*  They can learn and then deploy the thing and learned over time and do that weekly that sounds like maybe trivial
*  But it's nobody else is doing it and it's completely revolutionary
*  So cars once you buy them they don't learn most cars. That's the learns
*  That that's a huge thing. I forget about us autopilot all this stuff. Just the fact that you could update the software
*  I think there's a revolutionary idea and then they're also doing everything else from scratch
*  This is this first principles type of thinking the hardware. So the the hardware in your car
*  I don't know when you got the Tesla, but it should be hardware
*  version 2 but that hardware
*  Performs what's called inference so it's already trained
*  It's already learned its thing and it's just taking in the raw sensory input and making decisions
*  Okay, they built that hardware themselves from scratch again ballsy move
*  Now they're building what they're calling
*  again, he's such a troll, but they're calling dojo is the the name of the
*  the specialized hardware
*  For training the neural networks are training the models what training is is the learning side of it
*  So they're building their own like supercomputer at Google has a TPU to improve the training TPU was this 10 for?
*  tensor processing unit
*  It's the same thing as the more general and video has graphics processing unit GPUs that all the nerds all the people like me have
*  been using on
*  for machine learning to train neural networks
*  It's what most also gamers use to play video games, right?
*  But they have they have this nice quality that you can train huge neural networks on them. Okay TPU is
*  is a
*  Specialized hardware for training neural networks GPUs allow you to play video games and train neural networks
*  TPUs clean some stuff up to make it more efficient energy-efficient more efficient for the kinds of computation you know
*  Need
*  Google has them a bunch of other companies have them, you know
*  Most most car companies would be like, okay
*  Let me partner with somebody else to you from with Google to use their TPUs or use Nvidia's GPUs
*  Tesla's building it from scratch. So that kind of from scratch thinking is
*  is incredible and
*  The other two things I really listen we're like about Musk is the hard work
*  We live in a culture like so many people like I often don't sleep
*  I do crazy shit in terms of just focus stay up nights sometimes and now often people recommend to me
*  The you know balance is really important and taking a break is important. Yeah, that you
*  Rejuvenate yourself you return to with fresh ideas. All those things are true. Sleep is important
*  You had people on the podcast tell you how important sleep is but what most people don't
*  Don't advise me is
*  Hard work is more important passion is more important than all of those things
*  Like that should come first and then sleep empowers it rest empowers it rejuvenation powers
*  especially in the engineering disciplines hard work is everything and
*  He's sort of unapologetically about that. It's not like a
*  Come come to us come work with us. It'll be a friendly environment with free snacks
*  It's like you're gonna work the hardest you've ever worked on
*  Whether you agree with him or not on the most important problems of your life. Okay, I like that kind of thinking because
*  It emphasizes the hard work the the other part
*  It was in terms of meeting him in person
*  I don't know if you got to interact with that off because when he was on mic with you, he was very
*  He was very kind of it was hard to bring it out of him. Yeah in person before that
*  He was very jovial and friendly and huggy. He's great. Yeah, and then once he got on the microphone
*  I was like, oh this is heavy lifting. Yeah, bring this out of him. So then we started drinking drinking and then oh, yeah
*  Helps a lot and then once the drinking, you know, then then I got to see who he is
*  Yeah, I shouldn't have I should have done that but
*  Drinking yeah
*  No, the the thing that's really interesting is he's gone if you look at his biography like the kind of
*  Stress he's been under in terms of he's been at the brink of losing his his companies
*  several times yes, and he you know, he lost a child and
*  he just he's a that's the other thing that inspired me as a
*  Is that he can be a good dad while running so many companies because like I often wonder about you know
*  The kind of hours I pull on what I'm doing. Can I have a family?
*  Can I really give him because I'd love to be a father and can I have a family?
*  Can I be a good person like it's very very very very difficult if you work in 18 hours a day?
*  Yes to give your kids the time that they need but it's possible not 18 out
*  There's always I believe there's in life day months
*  Maybe years that you have to do the 18 hours a day, but not always there's time for right do the sprint
*  Sprints yeah, and then establish everything and then sit back but the problem with a lot of guys like him is
*  First of all, it's very difficult to find a replacement for the way he thinks right
*  So if he's if he's a CEO of these companies and he's the one who's the mastermind behind all these things
*  And then he wants to step back
*  finding a commensurate
*  Replacement is insanely difficult because most people who would be a potential replacement are already off doing their own shit
*  And there's not many people like him. That's the interesting that's actually the disappointing thing to me is that he's a
*  His kind of thinking is a verity. I'm not sure why that is exactly well
*  he's I joke around about it, but it I think there's a there's a spectrum of evolution and
*  His mind is clearly way more advanced than my mind. There's there's something going on in his mind in terms of his
*  Attraction to engineering issues
*  solutions to global problems
*  solutions to traffic problems pollution problems all the all the things that he's
*  The internet and he's trying to put he's trying to give the world internet
*  I mean he's got all these things going simultaneously and one of the things that I got out of I when I was talking to him
*  was that
*  He almost has a hard time
*  Containing these ideas that are just pouring out of his head like a raging river like he's trying to catch
*  Handfuls of water and his raging river of ideas that's going through his head
*  You know and when he described his childhood that he thought that everybody was like that and then as he got older
*  He you know thought he was insane. Yeah, I didn't I've I can relate to that I've
*  I'm trying to learn how to talk but I have trouble
*  Talking because it's like a million ideas running in my head like anything you say I'll immediately start
*  There's these like weird tangent they go off and I want to start thinking about them
*  Is that true with a lot of people in your line of work?
*  And I think so I think that's kind of puzzle solving like that's where the comfort is
*  I'm just surprised that a CEO is able to continue being that kind of puzzle solver
*  Do you see that tweet that he made about his plans like he put a tweet up and I think it was
*  2006 and
*  Then it's essentially done all those things. He's done all those things now the thing is most people
*  So a lot of people love Elon Musk, but there's a quite a large community of people that don't love him so much
*  Well, that's always the case. I don't know. I don't anybody great. I don't I don't know if that's always the case
*  When is it not the case?
*  Who does who accomplishes as many things that guy does where everybody loves them?
*  It's a difficult. I mean I I'm not a historian. I could say Steve Jobs
*  Terrible example so many people hated that guy so many people hated that guy
*  I have personal friends that are involved in technology that wouldn't use Apple products because he's such a twat
*  Sure, they didn't want to have anything to do with him. They knew people that were engineers under him
*  they said it was horrible and mean and it just
*  Required so much would scream at people and insult them and you know
*  Had these ideas in his head that he needed to get done
*  And if you couldn't work the hours that you needed to do what he wanted to to accomplish
*  You know who treat you like shit. Yeah
*  You're right. I just wish the world was better
*  I think because I like with all people like that like we Steve Jobs and with Elon Musk when he dies people will always
*  You'll remember the greatness right? Yeah, so that's that's how it seems to work
*  It's just sad that you can't celebrate that currently but I do think there's one particular aspect of his personality that I also share
*  That pisses people off really bad, which is like you said
*  He had a plan, but he's late on that plan. He keeps promising things
*  And he keeps being like a year or two or three late right and that really I
*  Don't know if it actually angers people or if people that already don't like you use that as a thing to say why they don't
*  Like you but it's certainly a thing that people say a lot
*  Yeah, and but I think that's an essential element of doing extremely difficult things is over promising and trying to over deliver
*  That's the whole point right is to to say to make all the engineers around you believe that is doable in a year
*  That's essential to do it in two years
*  So like that that kind of and truly believing it is
*  It seems to be a central didn't he have people pay full price for that Roadster
*  Like you got on a list of time. Yes, so you paid a quarter of a million dollars for a car. That's essentially vaporware
*  Yeah, but the thing so I don't know there's a little bunch of financial people they get like mad at that idea
*  Yeah, I don't like there's investors. You know it's like it's I think it's the most shorted stock in history
*  Yeah, so but it keeps kicking ass. I don't
*  Confuses the fuck out of people to me. It's the stock market is the most boring thing ever and people it's it's like it's a gambling
*  Yes, and so you trying to say you're an expert in investing in the stock market
*  I blocked I removed those people from my life because they don't say anything any interesting ideas
*  I said it but
*  That you know when you're doing legitimate investment. Yes
*  That's that's a really important service to society
*  But if you're commenting on the fundamentals of engineering problems that real engineers are trying to solve
*  That's not interesting to me the so
*  It that kind of stuff upsets
*  I think financial folks
*  But the beautiful thing is when you have people buy vaporware and you bring that vaporware to reality
*  That's the amazing thing
*  That he will definitely bring that roadster to reality if he doesn't die that roadster will happen
*  Yeah, if he dies bail out now same with it
*  Same with that insane cyber truck. Yeah, the cyber truck is fucking awesome
*  I'm so ridiculous if he lives long enough you better believe there's humans being put on Mars whether it's him or he gets everybody else
*  See that one. I'm skeptical of
*  Just the type of people that are gonna want to go
*  See you're not talking about the engineering problem. No getting I think it's possible
*  It's ultimately you know I mean it's look
*  Can we put people in space for sure we've definitely done it
*  Can we sure things well some people think space is fake space is fake that's you ever Google hashtag space is fake
*  It's wonderful. It's a testament to the education system in this country well
*  Well and that's tiny little tangent
*  I've gotten I joked about flat earth and space is fake a little bit almost like saying that's an interesting way to
*  Being open-minded, and then I realized that's not something to joke about
*  That there is a community of people that take it extremely seriously
*  And then some of them thanked me for acknowledging that the possibility of oh
*  And then I had said okay bless their little hearts. Okay. This is not a little brains
*  Little brains
*  But I appreciated their open-mindedness, but they should take introduction to physics MIT open courseware provides courses on physics
*  They should can a regular person just sign up for that yeah. Yeah, it's open free, so how does that work?
*  What do you have to do in order to take those courses?
*  It's also all made available online just go to MIT MIT org or is it you MIT open course where is the website?
*  I mean most people own it's all on YouTube now. Oh, that's beautiful. It's all lectures
*  They're like millions of use introductory lectures to physics mathematics statistics. I have courses on
*  physics but in order to
*  Understand that the work has been done to recognize the fact that the earth is round. What would you recommend right away?
*  classical mechanics with
*  exponential focus experimental focus see none of those things are gonna
*  Mechanics is good, but if you're a dingbat
*  You're not gonna be able to absorb all that look up the Wikipedia page for gravity. I think
*  That's not gonna help either. They say gravity's never been proven. No one understands gravity correct
*  There's no one who actually understands what gravity is we just know the effects of it. It's actually magnetism. Yes for sure
*  So you have to undertake the effort of proving the Wikipedia article for gravity wrong?
*  So Wikipedia bro, what a terrible example Wikipedia sketchy it says I'm Brian Cowan's brother
*  Says I got celiac disease says a bunch of shit. That's not real. How do you know you're not related? I know
*  Okay, I'm pretty sure
*  My brother I don't know if it says it anymore
*  Put it in there again fuck it
*  Wikipedia is actually another distributed system. That's incredibly surprising to me that it works. Yeah, it is right
*  Because even though there is a lot of misinformation in it and there's a lot of you know falsehoods
*  There's a lot of really good information as well, you know, particularly about historical figures and interesting stuff
*  You know if you want to find facts on things and on science research and science and technical topics
*  So not not like nutrition science or things with there's a lot of debates on like physics and math and so on
*  It's really good. It's really really good. So it's community supported. Yeah by other physicists
*  But moving back from a flight Earth can we go back to why you think we're not going to be colonizing Mars Oh
*  I'm not saying ever I'm just saying the problem to me is the type of people that would want to do it
*  Because they can't return, you know
*  That's the the real issue with going to Mars that you can't return this
*  You don't think there's a huge number of non crazy explorers in this world that want to die on Mars
*  I had a whole bit about it. I really believe that it's the
*  Fringe of the fringe that would be willing to die on Mars
*  No, I'll be willing to die on Mars. Really stay here. Come on. I like you don't go
*  No, it's here's my take on it like about me. It's all temporary. What's all temporary life. Yeah, it's temporary, right?
*  You're gonna die someday. Sure, but if you decide to die on fucking Mars like bro
*  You'll be sending me emails from Mars, dude. I fucked up. I
*  Won't be sending sauce here. This is the thing
*  You've you're into
*  The Native Americans you've been
*  Following your work there. I'm sad obsessed man. Yeah, I've been upset about World War two or one
*  But you're like you're converting me to think of like to the to the both the warrior cultures and the suffering in that world
*  The sufferings insane. It's insane. I'm this book on black elk
*  Man, it details his life from he was a young boy when during Custer's last stand
*  He was there when Custer was he black elk? Yeah, but the man the guy
*  What do you call that? He's a Oglala's?
*  Lakota medicine man medicine man. Yeah, and he just lived through the transition
*  He lived through the transition of them battling with the US soldiers to them being on the reservation and fucking
*  insane
*  poverty insane
*  just
*  In just the stories of people the illnesses and the deaths how many people's children died
*  malnutrient malnourishment starvation
*  abuse and then how
*  Just how much they hated where they were living and how they were living on the reservation. Yes. It's horrific man. It's horrific. It's like
*  It's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine when you're reading that this just happened, you know
*  He's talking about the really horrible parts at the end were in the early 1920s 1930s
*  It's hard to imagine it's hard to imagine that this this tribe from
*  100 years prior in the 1820s were living wild and free and
*  Where you know?
*  We're living the same way they had lived for hundreds of years and had this incredible
*  Relationship with the land and these incredible religion that they practiced where they
*  Worshipped the the earth and the animals and the sky and they had all these
*  concepts for the way you should live your life and how to
*  guarantee prosperity and how to guarantee success and man, it's just they had a
*  Fascinating culture. I mean and it's gone
*  It was wiped off the face of the map. There was nothing like it anywhere else on earth
*  There's no there was no culture anywhere on earth
*  that was like the Native American culture in the
*  1600s 1700s 1800s and but in that period of time they had this
*  spectacular way of life and it was often very cruel and very
*  ruthless and they wore it on each other like this this idea that Native Americans were
*  Living in peace and harmony with each other's nonsense. Yes, I started I was listening while doing hills
*  Yes, you kicked my ass. I was listening to the Empire of the Summer Moon fucking great man. She I
*  commented in your Instagram
*  like saying something
*  You know basically
*  Admiring the purity of that way of life. Yeah, I got so much shit by people saying oh you think rape and murder is
*  Is pure and admirable so there is a certainly an aspect to their way of life
*  Which is sort of the warrior ethos right the Comanche's in particular
*  They were the most ruthless the most warlike
*  That's all they did basically like the Genghis Khan the same kind of the same horses the innovators actually more innovators
*  Yeah, and all they ate was meat as well. I mean all they date was buffalo. I mean they essentially rode with the buffalo
*  Killed buffalo hunted buffalo and then raided other tribes and then until the white man came and then they started raiding the white man killing
*  the white man, but they were you know at war with
*  White people for hundreds of years. I mean they were the reason why the West was hard to settle
*  I mean the the sneaky shit
*  I don't know if you've gotten to the point where they were giving people these big swaths of land in Oklahoma and
*  They essentially set them up to be killed by the Comanche
*  They will say hey go out here. We'll give you a 1600 acres. It's all yours and they're like, oh terrific
*  Let's get our family get in a wagon and no one let them know that the wildest motherfuckers that ever ever lived on this continent
*  we're running that place and they would go there and just get slaughtered and one after another families were wiped out that way and people were
*  kidnapped and that lady that I have on the wall outside
*  Cynthia Ann Parker who was
*  Adopted by the Comanche she's her family was murdered in front of her when she was nine years old and she became the wife of a
*  Great Comanche chief and her son became the last Comanche chief Kwan a Parker
*  It's crazy. It's the craziest story
*  There's all these tribes that some are probably more warlike some are more peaceful. Yes. Yeah that had a way of life here
*  I don't know what a math says too much
*  I mean most people don't believe me, but I'd really like that way of life that closeness to nature
*  You said texting and from Mars or whatever. I like I like, you know, I wouldn't choose it
*  But I would be happier if I was forced into it. It seems like a con counterintuitive notion
*  But because I'm so weak. I'm so soft. They keep on running hills yesterday. I realized how soft I am
*  Well, you work too much. Yeah, no behind a computer. Yeah little fingers typing
*  But you're also a black belt in jujitsu you also a martial artist, you know, you know me against the Comanche warrior
*  Good luck. I think you fuck a Comanche up. They don't know how to fight for real. They had a weapon
*  They kill you think you're just I know I I
*  Listen first of all, they were pretty small. They weren't very big people
*  Maybe I'm second of all they didn't know jujitsu. They had the average person that doesn't know jujitsu
*  The fuck out of them that'd be fun actually to sort of go into different warring cultures
*  I go in and get this con times. Yeah without weapons to see what kind of combat styles
*  I had just send Francis and Gano. He'd clean out the entire
*  I mean just send hoys Gracie's yeah for sure. Yeah, I'm gonna in all generations will be yeah be screwed
*  He's not interesting. Yeah, right. It's just overwhelming but I think that if you had
*  real jujitsu skills
*  You know what you know now today particularly because jujitsu has evolved so much
*  I mean even the jujitsu of 2020 is so radically different from the jujitsu of you know
*  1990 it's radically different like like almost unrecognizable in a lot of ways
*  But clearly though the basics are still the most important and there are some of the greats of all time who just
*  Operate with the basics whether it's hard your Gracie or Hicks and Gracie or you know
*  There's a lot of great great jujitsu players that just have those solid solid he Barrow
*  You know solid
*  basics that are just
*  Hone to razor sharp edge, you know, you know crone crone Gracie. He's got
*  And I when I say basic it is a compliment
*  I mean he you know arm bars triangles guillotines renegade chokes those types of things
*  but
*  Perfected to a level that is they don't they don't participate in a lot of the more modern
*  There's a lot of like crafty weird stuff that a lot of guys try today
*  and some of the greats even the greats that participate in jujitsu matches today and are
*  Effective at it don't don't really have that kind of style
*  Yeah, I mean, but crone is actually has some more creativity if you look at Roger Gracie
*  That's like basic this I don't I don't even know if he does foot locks like I think that my favorite thing to do is
*  On YouTube just watch Roger Gracie matches like he looks like he's half asleep and he demolishes the greatest black belts in the world
*  Slowly by just like in a half asleep way taking them down
*  Passing their guard going to mount and doing a choke. Yeah, it's like the
*  Against I don't know but Chacha again against
*  Just the best well my instructor John Chuck Machado same thing man just his style is just
*  solid
*  Basics of jujitsu and he has a saying that you more you know, the less you use
*  Which is really interesting. Well, you mentioned Comanche Warriors and the meat. Yeah Congrats on the I saw the the diet the
*  Carnivore diet is yeah, man. Here's something crazy
*  I got off that diet for this weekend because it was I did the month and then once Saturday came around
*  I ate Italian food. I had Girl Scout cook. I'm so
*  Pasta and then yesterday I went to Disneyland
*  So yesterday I went way way off the diet and I had ice cream and I ate all kinds of shitty food
*  And I was getting back pains and knee pains and all these kind of weird pains that went away
*  When I was on the diet now, this is not a testament against
*  Plant-based diets because I was eating shit
*  Shitty food right and pot pasta, you know, which is a lot of you know, bread pasta. Yeah. Yeah spaghetti that stuff
*  It causes inflammation. It just does you know, it just does sugar causes inflammation
*  But it's interesting to have this great month where basically two weeks in after the diarrhea died off
*  I had two solid weeks of no aches and pains and feeling great. I was like, this is wild
*  This is really why I feel amazing
*  Well, and then two days of eating shit and like my back hurts right now
*  I'm sitting here. My back is hurting. My knee was hurting left yesterday
*  Like all these weird aches come right back
*  well
*  it's a there's a
*  The nice thing about the Joe Rogan effect is that you trying to die and you talking about keto a lot
*  That's like become more socially acceptable to do because I've been eating
*  Keto or low carb for many years and doing fasting like 24 48 hour fast
*  Mm-hmm, and I'll always kind of keep it more in the low down
*  but even this time like traveling like what I like to do when traveling is
*  Kind of I'm trying to be
*  give my current situation not spend much money and
*  So I go one of the best ways to go either carnivore or keto is to go to McDonald's and
*  Just order beef patties. They'll sell you just be bad. I mean that is $1.50
*  Really fatty for a quarter pound. Yeah, so you can you know, like it's like usually what I use about two pounds of meat a day and
*  That's what is it? I?
*  Don't know that's like 15 bucks. So you've been doing this carnivore thing, too
*  How long you been doing it for off and on so I have to for
*  The carnivore I've done since the first time either your podcast or Jordan Peterson over that kind of thing
*  I dived into but before then I've been doing keto like my favorite meal is just like meat and I know some people hate
*  Cauliflower, but cauliflower and or green beans just that's why do you worry if people hate cauliflower?
*  Why'd you have to make that distinction?
*  Some people hate cauliflower. I'm not out there hating cauliflower. Who the fuck are those people?
*  That's a weird thing. Hey, I just had a bunch of people say
*  Cauliflower sucks recently. So yeah, you're right cooking right? It doesn't suck. You know, it's good
*  Buffalo cauliflower like buffalo wings buffalo sauce
*  Cauliflower fucking delicious. What's that? But that's a sauce. Yeah. No sauces is like you're giving into your weakness
*  Mmm spices and you're giving away no see like a
*  Blender taste to me is better because you get to appreciate the fundamentals of the food. So I got okay
*  So I don't know. I just enjoy it and you do salt meat salt. Yeah
*  Oh, how do you do that when you but salt appreciate the fundamentals of the meat? Yeah
*  Good point. Yeah
*  You don't like checkers. You're playing chess. Do you like hot sauce hot sauce on everything? Yeah, I do
*  Stay away from it. Like I tried to listen food to me right now in my life is a source of energy
*  Not a source of pleasure, but it can be both
*  Unfortunately, I'm not addicted to drugs. I'm not addicted to many things but with food my mind
*  I don't know how to moderate really so like anything pleasurable is a problem for me
*  Like cookies you put two cookies in front of me like I don't know how to eat just one of them
*  Like it's just doesn't my brain is terrible at it. This is girl called the Girl Scout cookie season son
*  Yeah, they changed the name of Samoa's. Those are my favorite and now they have a new name. They're like I
*  Think they're calling like tag alongs or something like that
*  What's that for a while? I think really?
*  When they change separate things though, I think is that am I talking about the wrong thing?
*  The ones that are like though their chocolate on the bottom. It's
*  To this I have that coconut in them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  That doesn't sound like the words of a man who's gonna stick to the carnivore diet. I'm a stick. All right
*  Yeah, I mean I'll have cheat days or cheat meals. I should say tag alongs the peanut butter. Oh, that's right
*  Those are good. So those are fucking good. What are the Samoans now? What do they call them now?
*  But they just changed. Oh, okay. They just changed to something new
*  Ever now what do you a robot I'm Russian too
*  Basically a robot
*  Basically, I eat six of those and I was feeling like shit
*  What it maybe this is just a very quick caramel delight is that what's called now
*  I don't think so just someone might have owned another company or whoever they were paying to I was wondering if it was a racial issue
*  That's what the question was was someone saying because it was racist
*  It's odd question answers know the name of the cook is are owned by the two different companies who make them
*  Ah
*  It changed the name
*  Racial issue Wow cuz Samoa like someone might be like sensitive to having a cookie named after an island
*  People like a fuckface. That's our island. Not your cookie, you know
*  See that those cookies don't even sound good to me anymore. What about American cheese?
*  Is that okay? Yeah cheat American cheese. They're not okay. Well American. Oh, yeah, what like I stay with the Russian
*  A
*  Tvorek it's a cottage cheese. Well, there's there's Swiss cheese
*  There's American cheese and that's it right? Is there any other countries that are named
*  specifically
*  After the cheese named after the country, I bet you it's not even just like french fries
*  I bet you American cheese is not even American
*  Do you remember when there was freedom fries for a while people were trying to call fries freedom fries like post 9-eleven because they were
*  Mad that France didn't want us going over to Iraq. Yeah, and then people who hate freedom banned it
*  Yeah, freedom fries. Oh, that's so dumb. I think I really like actually
*  like I think that's the thing that people don't often talk about is
*  the focus so like my life I think a lot of people do this is
*  Being able to focus for long periods of time and that's why I stuck with with keto and with those or fasting especially
*  Yes, the focus is pretty tremendous. Well, that's what I really got with the carnivore diet
*  The amount of my flatness of energy the lack of dips in valleys peaks and valleys. It's amazing. Yeah, it's great
*  It's uh, and the fast fasting helps me to like Jack Dorsey doesn't only what's called. Oh mad one meal a day
*  Yeah, you could just say one meal a day. This is oh mad stuff. Jesus Christ
*  I'm a I'm a hip reddit lingo guy
*  And I think I read it. It's oh mad. Oh, okay
*  No, I don't know one meal a day but 20, you know 24-hour fast that
*  that that's that's a
*  Careful weapon you have to play with at least for me
*  Like it for some it's weird it helps your mind really focus
*  I can sit sometimes for five six hours a day like programming really thinking and like lose track of time and really focus
*  But when you do so when you interact with other human beings, you're kind of a little bit of an asshole
*  Like I am sorry. I mean when I am
*  Oh
*  in a
*  in a way where
*  It's funny, but if there's something about a person that's full of crap
*  You are more likely to point that out like when you're on keto or carnivore
*  No, it's a irrespective of diet keto carnivore. Whatever is the the fasting the other fasting
*  Okay fasting really so it's just more irritable. Is it what it is?
*  I think it's irritable, but you also see things more clearly
*  It's like I don't know. I'll talk to my parents right or something like that when I'm more well-fed
*  I'll be like just enjoy having fun with them. And if I'm like fasted, I'll be like
*  Why are you always judging me kind of thing? Right?
*  Like you you you realize the thing the the aspects of the interaction which are problematic and you want to sort of highlight them
*  I'm just sort of noticing it which is
*  problematic when you're in a working environment, especially sort of
*  Deliberating discussing with other engineers how to solve a problem
*  I'm more likely especially you know lead a team to say that somebody's a little bit full of shit
*  When I'm fasting as opposed to that makes sense and being a little bit more kind and eloquent about expressing
*  Why they're full of shit. I found myself feeling more aggressive and
*  more
*  inclined to use recreational insults
*  When fasting or carnivore carnivore, what's the recreational insult?
*  Like come on fuckface fuckface, you know
*  Like saying something like that someone or fill in the blank with whatever the rate of other words you like academic paper
*  The rate of fuckface goes up
*  Well, just just in casual conversation. I'd find myself using
*  Fun insults but more often like with the intent of kindness behind like no
*  I mean having fun even talking about people weren't there just having fun
*  But
*  That that's also a function of being a comedian. We do that to each other really bad
*  Yeah, like when like I had a birthday my friends made me a cake said happy birthday faggot
*  It's like that kind of shit is just so a part of the culture of comedians
*  Like everybody calls everybody bitch everybody, you know, it's just yeah
*  It's fun
*  Which is awesome because this comedian culture is now at full on war with the cancel culture
*  And it's like it's like two armies of people who don't give a damn with people who give way too much of a damn
*  Well, I have mixed feelings about all that stuff
*  But I ultimately feel like the direction it's moving in the reason why it's happening is for good
*  I think there's a lot of people that are complaining about things and they're trying to cancel people and all that stuff and it's
*  You know ultimately some of its misguided
*  But I think the ideas behind it like the the primary push like the gravity behind it is
*  people want
*  less racism less discrimination
*  less
*  Less of a lot of things but then along the way you have
*  Hypocritical human behavior that gets involved in this and you have people that are, you know deeply flawed themselves
*  But pointing out minor flaws and other people and then they get exposed and they feel horrible and for every person who
*  Participates in this cancel culture. It's like the wave is coming back at you
*  I mean it comes in and it comes out and if you go too far out on that fucking pier
*  it's it's gonna get you and
*  This is part of it that we're learning and I think
*  What what people are today?
*  like if you look at
*  the
*  Just the if you look at humanity from like the 1930s
*  Who's hard man people lived in a hard way?
*  It was ruthless if you fit watch films from the 1900s early 1900s
*  the first of all
*  the
*  Domestic violence was so normal
*  Yeah, like heroes in movies in the 50s and 60s just smacked women in the face heroes smacked their wives
*  You know hit their kids as it was a different world
*  And and people will look probably at our time today and say, you know people openly ate meat
*  Meaning not or like I
*  Can see it not engineered me not engineered me. Yeah sort of eight meat from factory farms. Mm-hmm
*  As opposed to
*  recreationally hunting it themselves and eating what they've hunted or
*  Engineered meat to lab meat. Yeah, or you can get ethically raised food
*  I mean there are there are a lot of ranchers like it's one of things that butcher box does very well as they
*  Make sure that they have relationships with ranchers who have a commitment to ethically raised animals and ethically
*  Ethically killed animals and what that means is, you know, they don't participate in anything that has anything to do with factory farming
*  No antibiotics no added hormones ever and that is possible
*  I mean people have been eating animals from the beginning of time
*  literally
*  97 percent of the world eats animals and
*  this idea that
*  The only way to do it is through factory farming. I don't think that's correct and the only way you know
*  I mean this the idea is if you eat meat you participate in factory farming and that's horrific
*  I don't think that's true
*  But I do think it is true when it comes to fast food for the most part and that's unfortunate and I think
*  If they could I mean
*  We need more transparency for sure when it comes to that stuff
*  That's one of the reasons why those ag gag laws
*  Agricultural gag laws where people there's laws that prevent people from working in these factory farming situations to expose
*  There's laws that prohibit them from exposing the horrors of these environments. That's a real problem
*  That's a real issue that's clearly designed to protect that industry and allow them to commit these crimes
*  Yeah, it's one of the things
*  I'm a I'm conscious of my own hypocrisy in this so I've I think deeply unfortunately love meat
*  sort of like and I'm aware of
*  the
*  they
*  how
*  unethical
*  Factory farming is you know, and so those two things I have to sit with and be conscious of I don't know
*  That's a question. Like when did that happen?
*  When did the factory farming thing have you go back to the 1930s there was no factory farming it was just farming
*  You know sure I think it was probably incremental. Are you sure it wasn't in 1930s? There wasn't already some
*  Mass so what is factory farming is scale but also sort of the suffering. There's a certain line you start to cross
*  Where it just feels those I mean, yeah, it's unclear which point it really becomes torture versus
*  Agriculture agriculture. That's an interesting line and we're gonna
*  Yeah, it's probably a good answer for that. The real problem is probably fast food
*  The birth of fast food is really probably where it sure where's McDonald's McDonald's probably started a hundred years ago. I
*  Don't know. I'm not sure when started
*  At scale, you know the the feeding of massive amounts of people that aren't growing anything
*  that's the real issue is the real issue is when you whether you're in New York City or
*  Shanghai or
*  Los Angeles large
*  Gigantic metropolitan areas that aren't growing anything
*  They got to get a lot of food to those people if you have 20 million people like in Los Angeles 20 million people eat meat
*  That's a lot of meat
*  Yeah, you gotta feed them. Yeah, you gotta feed them. Oh, there's science steps up. I think lab engineer meat is kind of interesting
*  Yeah, it is interesting. Have you how much have you paid attention to it? Not much. I'm waiting. I
*  This is the horrible thing
*  I'm very cognizant of it that I kind of don't allow my brain to think much about this whole space
*  Because I love meat and I'm trying to save money. I get it right. So you eat those McDonald's
*  you know, so and and
*  The life of a scientist, right?
*  The scientists and especially now I've taken a leap. That's a difficult leap
*  So I'm still affiliated with MIT, but I decided to
*  Leave my full-time position why do a startup? So I want to try to build
*  Trying trying to build the kind of thing I dreamed about we talked about the movie her
*  I've been working that's been 80 90 percent of my day. In fact me doing the podcast is
*  Trying to is not trying is already successful at giving me enough money for food and shelter tell people the name of the podcast
*  So they can artificial intelligence podcast
*  Lex Friedman
*  Listen to uh, what is it? You know, I'm us Eric Weinstein's on there. I talk
*  Gary Kasparov Chomsky Sean Carroll Sean Carroll's brilliant. He is brilliant. What is it like talking to Chomsky?
*  He loves it. Oh, yeah
*  Well, I talk most people say my voice is very boring and I talk slowly to those people I say go fuck yourself
*  I love you. I love you. You're right. I'm trying to actually
*  It's very difficult to be
*  to express thoughts like Sam Harris struggles with us to to express thoughts with the kind of
*  Humor and eloquence that they are in your brain like to convert them like as a comedian. You're essentially a storyteller
*  So you already you don't often you probably don't even acknowledge. You don't even know how you did it. You're like Hodge a Gracie
*  you've probably developed this art of storytelling of being able to
*  Laugh and make other people laugh of like bouncing back and forth to me
*  Most of my life has been spent behind a book or computer
*  Thinking interesting thoughts but not connecting with other people and doing that dance of conversation. It's a learning that dance
*  While also thinking it's really tough. So which Chomsky was like a pleasure because we can all both be robots
*  But but I think he's like 92 years old. Is he really? Yeah, and the thing I love the bottom
*  So, you know, there's all that political stuff that I don't pay attention
*  I mean, he's he's a major sort of activist
*  But he's also a linguist that thinks that language is at the core of everything of cognition
*  So like it's at the bottom everything starts with language cognition
*  The reasoning perception all of that is things built on top of language
*  this is a brilliant sort of seminal research and but 92 years old he still looked in my eyes and
*  Really listened and really thought and really sharp ideas came out like you do the same thing that was people asked me like we meet
*  Joe Rogan like you don't take yourself too seriously
*  Even with your celebrity with the popularity podcast. That's a huge thing and with Chomsky
*  What was really surprising to me is while he's pretty stubborn on his ideas and so on people criticize him
*  He's so stubborn in his ways. He didn't take himself too seriously. Like I sat there
*  I'm just some kid talking to him. He like really listened. Mmm, like the stupid questions the interesting questions
*  He really listened 92 years old to have that kind of curiosity
*  That was I was like, I'm so happy when I see that kind of thing
*  Yeah, that's that's a wonderful example of a career academic who's still just concentrating on ideas ideas
*  Yeah, I'm still thinking always, you know, cuz
*  Academics can be like really any other
*  Endeavor any other discipline you can get lazy, right?
*  You see that in almost every walk of life
*  There's certain people that rest on their laurels and especially when you become popular you get really good at explaining
*  So you get like you do these talks you do these lectures you start saying the same thing over and over
*  Yeah, and you forget to listen like out of because of because of this podcast the the artificial intelligence pockets
*  But also Joe Rogan very two different groups of fans whom I both love
*  You know people come up to me and start a conversation and I love it like the just like listening to them and there
*  Yeah, I hope I never lose that I'm like younger than Chomsky. I hope you stay that way
*  It's nice if you have the time. It's a problem if you're in the rush and someone wants to talk to you about something like very deep
*  Yes, I've had those moments where someone says hey, man, I gotta ask you and then they I'm like dude
*  This is a long conversation. I can't I can't do that's right. That's the burden. That's your burden actually
*  I'm in a beautiful place, which I don't think will last too long, which is I'm not sufficiently famous to
*  To work like those things don't happen often right to work and I can have that conversation right you have the luxury
*  Although let me say I got to hang out Brian Callan who I've been a huge fan of on New Year's Eve
*  I got to watch the old man dance
*  Break some dance moves on that and this funny thing happened
*  He's a celebrity. Yeah
*  so we're hanging out and two times somebody came up to me and Brian and
*  They said wow, it's Lex Friedman. It's so good to
*  And then they completely ignore Brian
*  Fucker maybe is so proud. It's cuz it's a Boston. Yeah, I think it's like nerds and whatever. Sure
*  Yeah, it was that is funny though. It's hilarious. He's a
*  He's one of my I mean it was incredible
*  Like I didn't know you guys are friends until they all came together in the podcast and so on
*  I was a huge fan of his from like Matt TV days. He's one of my oldest friends. Yeah, how'd you guys?
*  What's what's how'd you met on Matt TV? I was a host one week and he was the he was you know
*  One of the stars of the show. He's an awesome guy man. They're like a really underappreciated person and he's a guy that
*  Because he acts so much and because he gets into that, you know, he's just
*  Always into that world. He didn't put the same amount of time into doing his podcast his personal podcast
*  As I think he should have because he's great at it, you know
*  he was one of the first people that I knew that interviewed Jordan Peterson and
*  He's know that yeah, he said a bunch of brilliant people on his podcast
*  He's had a bunch of like really interesting
*  intellectuals and
*  Scientists and I think it's mixed mental arts or something like that. Yeah, he's doing it with it with hunter his friend
*  He stopped doing it with him
*  He's um, he's an unusual guy Brian Callan is because he's silly, but he's also brilliant
*  Yeah, you can see that sort of Eric Weinstein has the same quality obviously from different worlds the silliness
*  You can see through the silliness that there's an intelligent first of all good human being there
*  But also yeah, but at the same time he's like the butt of every joke. I appreciate that so much
*  I love silly people
*  silly people are so much more fun the people that are like easily offended and easily upset like
*  He's so exhausting
*  silly people are the best I actually uh, so I
*  Played your theme song on guitar
*  And Brian cows researching it and like how do you play it and then Jerry theme song?
*  And there's a Brian Callan singing
*  Yeah video of like Joe Rogan shoulders for days. Yeah. Yeah some silly song
*  He made I'm gonna I'm working on a deal
*  I'm gonna try to figure out cuz I can play guitar and play the theme song and put up online
*  He's gonna work together make an album. No, we're gonna make an out like a Joe Rogan theme
*  He's gonna come up with some words on there. What's the notes? You got you got pages and pages of notes in front of you
*  There's just stuff that you really wanted to discuss. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we definitely talked about AI at all
*  But let me at least Boston Dynamics. It'd be interesting to talk
*  Well, I don't think there was a fake video that I sent Jamie today these motherfuckers. They keep getting me
*  There's a new fake video. I think that was the same one. I think there's someone who's took another clip from it
*  Oh, is it those guys have been making VFX videos on YouTube for 10 plus years. They're really good at it
*  So that's so good people don't know that there's a YouTube channel where people I think it's a single YouTube channel that
*  Does like yeah visual effects like fake?
*  Humanoid or yes dog
*  Robots that kind of resemble something like Boston Dynamics would do this was one easy stuff with guns
*  Yeah, this one they gave the robot a gun and have see if you pull it up Jamie
*  What is the gentleman the corridor digital on YouTube is the guys that keep that make a quarter crew as the YouTube channel
*  I fucking incredible that it's not real. It looks so real and so the the robot they kick it
*  They hit it with a hockey helmet or a hockey stick rather
*  Like long video they made a while ago
*  They might have made a new one which was one out in desert, but I think I've seen it before
*  I see they trick you with the Boston Dynamics. It's boss town
*  It looks so realistic, but here's the thing we're not that far off from this thing. No
*  Let's let's walk it back. Let's walk it back it. It's not realistic
*  In what way so let's it looks human realistic
*  So you can tell it's a human like a robotics person could tell it's a human
*  Because it's really difficult to do that kind of motion that kind of movement. Oh like when it's getting shot
*  Well not the getting shit, so there's a lot of movement it does for the purpose of comedy
*  right like it actually is on purpose trying to look like a
*  Human for the comedic internet effect like getting a human that's getting pissed off and so on
*  Those qualities are like another order of magnitude here where it's like
*  Movements some of those are just comedic. You know you don't need terminator type robot right, but they do have
*  Legitimate robots that can do back flips now and do so it's it really is a backflips like this war
*  This is real this is all reals manipulation so all of these robots
*  Depending on what we're talking about here
*  But those are remote controlled and these are single demonstrations that they've perfected so there it's really important to
*  Distinguish between the body of the robot and the brain of the robot so these bodies unlike anything else unlike a Roomba
*  Unlike a drone who can also be very threatening the these bodies somehow
*  We anthropomorphize them and they terrify us. I don't know what it is. I met spot many in person
*  That was one of the most transformative moments in my life really because I know how dumb it is
*  but the experience of it like
*  It's not even a head. It's supposed to be a hand
*  But it looks like a head and it like looking up at me with that hand. I felt like I was like
*  It was magic. It was like a
*  It was like Frankenstein coming to life is this moment of creation and
*  What I realized is my own brain sort of anthropomorphize in the same way
*  You're like looking at these robots, and you're thinking these things are terrifying. Yeah, like what's like you know in 10 20 years
*  What were we going to be yeah?
*  That's our brain playing tricks on us because the key thing that's a threat to humanity or an exciting possibility for humanity is the
*  intelligence of the robots the brains the mind and
*  These robots have very very little intelligence
*  So one of the so in terms of being able to perceive and understand the world
*  Very importantly very importantly to be learned to learn about the world from scratch
*  So the terrifying thing is you talked often like with this
*  Philosophical kind of notion that Sam Harris talks about sort of exponential improvement be able to
*  Become human level intelligence superhuman level intelligence in a matter of days become more intelligent than that
*  That's all learning process. That's being able to learn that's the key aspect. We're in a very early days of that there's a
*  there's an idea of
*  You know big bang is a funny word for one of the most fundamental ideas in the nature of our universe same way
*  self-play is a term for I
*  Think one of the most important powerful ideas and artificial intelligence that people are currently working on so self-play
*  I don't know if you're familiar with a company called deep mind and open AI Google deep mind
*  And a game I know you're first person shooter guy, but Starcraft and Dota 2
*  So last year these are what do you call them real-time strategy?
*  I guess in people win millions of dollars in eSport competitions and
*  so open AI separately had
*  Open AI 5 which took on Dota 2 Dota 2 is the computer game based on Warcraft 3
*  that's the most popular eSport game and then deep mind took on Starcraft with their alpha star system and
*  The key amazing thing is there similar to alpha go and alpha zero that learned to play go is the mechanism of self-play
*  That's the exciting mechanism that I think if you can figure out how to have an impact on
*  More serious problems than games would be transformative. Okay, what is it? It's learning from scratch in a competitive environment
*  so thinking of
*  You have two white belts. So I go into DJ
*  so you have you have two white belts training against each other and
*  trying to figure out how to beat each other without ever having blackball supervision and structures and so on and
*  slowly getting better that way coming up inventing new moves that way and
*  Eventually, they they get better and better by that competitive process
*  That's the machine playing itself without human supervision
*  The interesting thing is there's a lot of cases in which if you set up the competitive environment
*  Well enough for those two white belts, they'll learn to be black belts
*  They'll learn to be not only black belts. They'll learn to be better than like
*  Exactly the kind of evolution that's happening MMA right now
*  If you put that in a digital space and speed it up, you know a million fold it'll continue to improve
*  Let me pause you here because this is one of the things that I think probably
*  Translates to AI as it does to jujitsu. You need more than one opponent
*  Like you can't have one input one person training with one person specifically and
*  Singularly you're not going to develop the type of game that you need to become a real black belt in jujitsu
*  100% exactly. So that's part of the brilliance of this mechanism. So
*  imagine you didn't just have white belts you had a
*  Opportunity to generate a new random white belt like a like a fat big one
*  I'm a little one right and all kinds of different one that aggressive one daddy Bravo
*  Passive one one and then and let them play and then so it's what you find is
*  Like jujitsu might be simpler than the general problem sort of different kind of like
*  Starcraft and so on but there is sets of strategies in this giant space
*  There these complex hierarchical strategies like high level strategies and then specifics of different moves that emerge some of which you didn't even realize
*  Existed and that requires that you start with the huge amounts of random initial
*  States like the fat person the skinny person the aggressive person so on and then you also
*  Keep injecting randomness in the system. So you discover new ideas
*  So even when you reach purple belt, you don't continue with those same people you start your own school
*  you start like you start expanding to totally random new ideas and
*  Expanding this way and when you find out is there's totally surprising to human beings
*  Like in the game of chess or in the game of go in the game of Starcraft
*  These this self play mechanism can do what sort of AI people have dreamed of which is be creative
*  Create totally new behaviors totally new strategies. They're surprising to human experts. That's why go was so
*  Astounding to them right because it's such a complex game
*  It's a hard game and and it's able to well the first astounding thing is able to beat the world champion
*  Yeah, the second astounding thing about both chess and go is it's able to create
*  Totally new ideas sort of I'm not good enough at chess or go to understand the newness of them
*  But Grand Masters talk about the way alpha alpha zero
*  Plays chess and they say there's a lot of brilliant interesting ideas there like very counterintuitive ideas and that's such a and that's all
*  The first breakthroughs didn't have as much self play
*  They were trained on human experts but alpha zero and alpha star and open AI 5
*  These systems are all fundamentally self play meaning no human supervision starting from scratch
*  So no black ball instructor you just wrote you generate and that means so they learning from scratch
*  That's the that's exceptionally powerful. Okay, that's a process from zero
*  You can get the superhuman level intelligence in a particular task
*  In a matter of days. Mm-hmm. That's that's super powerful super exciting
*  Super terrifying if that's kind of what you think about the the challenges
*  We don't know how to do that in the physical space in the space of robots. There's something fundamentally different about
*  Being able to perceive to understand this environment to do common-sense reasoning
*  The thing we really take for granted is our ability to reason about the physics of the world
*  About the fact that things weigh things that you can stack things on top of each other
*  the fact that some things are hard some things are soft some things are
*  Painful when you touch them all that like there seems to be a giant Wikipedia inside our brain of like common-sense dumb
*  Logic, that's very tough to build up that
*  This yeah, that's that's it seems to be an exceptionally difficult
*  Learning problem that Boston Dynamics will have to solve in order to achieve even the same kind of
*  Physical movement behavior that we saw in those videos and then on top of that to have the ethical behavior
*  the that not the ethical sort of the objective the
*  Complex strategies involved in first following orders and then getting frustrated and then shooting everybody
*  That's an exceptionally difficult thing to arrive at because ultimately these systems operating on a set of objectives and
*  What a lot of people that think about artificial general intelligence say the objectives
*  We need to inject in these systems that they're trained on need to have one uncertainty
*  So they should always doubt themselves just like if you want to be a good blackball. You should always be sort of
*  You should always be sort of
*  Always open-minded sort of relax always need to learn techniques. It's okay to get submitted. So always
*  Always have a degree of uncertainty about your worldview the kind of thing we criticized Twitter
*  Outrage mobs for not having so having uncertainty and the other thing is always have a place where there should be human supervision
*  And I think I just there's a I think we have good mechanisms for that in place
*  that I think
*  I'm very optimistic about where these kinds of learning systems can take us the exciting thing is
*  Boston dynamic or terrifying depending on
*  whether you think I'm a
*  trustworthy human being but
*  Boston Dynamics is not opening up their platform
*  So they're working with a few people. I'm trying to make I'm quite busy these days
*  I'm trying to make time to make it happen to work with them to build stuff on top of the platform
*  So I'm referring to spot many as a platform. So this robot is this dumb. It's like a Roomba
*  It's a dumb mechanistic thing that can move for you, but you can build you can add a brain on top of it
*  So you can make it learn you can make it see the world and so on. That's all extra
*  That's not what Boston Dynamics offers
*  So they want to work with people like me to to add that kind of capability and that's exciting because
*  Now you can have hundreds of people start to add
*  interesting learning
*  Capabilities and so I mean I may have to retract my words about how far away we are
*  With the capabilities of these robots once you now open up to the internet
*  So I was speaking to Boston Dynamics
*  I think they're solving the really hard robotics problem
*  But once you open it up to the huge world of researchers that are doing machine learning and doing computer vision and doing AI research
*  The kind of capabilities that might add to these robots might surprise us
*  That's where people are concerned right the big leaps the big lead and then sort of
*  Just not being aware the consequences of these big leaps and once you let the genie out of the bottle you can never put it back
*  Right the genie and the self play mechanism where you grow from zero to becoming world-class chess player
*  That's that's the genie being out of the bottle. Did you see black mirror? Yeah black mirror
*  You know that episode heavy metal with heavy metal
*  Very difficult to pull that off very so for now for now
*  And you had a you had a conversation with Nick Bostrom whom also talking with on the podcast. Yeah
*  One of the things he mentioned is so I don't think he thinks about this stuff a lot
*  I I do about military applications. Mm-hmm. I talked to folks. That's one of the things people don't
*  Just like with me they kind of put to the side. They don't want to think about military applications
*  I'll be more worried about drones than I would be about robot dogs
*  right because
*  the kind of stuff was on the black mirror episode is
*  Really difficult to pull off to make a robot learn
*  I could drones are kind of more impressive right because they they hover they can move through 3d space
*  They they have hellfire missiles attached to them
*  I mean, there's a lot of crazy shit that they can absolutely do right now with drones and you're talking about large-scale drones
*  but you can think of
*  Small-scale drones and I think there's a I think there's also a black mirror episode with drones where they take over
*  I haven't seen that one. So there's a I think there's drones everywhere and they're kind of doing
*  You know your basic friendly government surveillance
*  Mass surveillance kind of thing. I think it's for I think they sell in the episode that is for a good
*  Cause well see what spoiler alerts, but I think they like start killing everybody or
*  Of course
*  Wasn't there there has been research done on making artificial insects that have like little cameras inside of them
*  that look like like a
*  Dragonfly or some some sort of bug they fly around and they could film things and the thing that terrifies a lot of people is going
*  more microscopic than that more like robots inside the body that help you cure diseases
*  Yeah, I hope not are certain things even at the nanoscale
*  So
*  Basically creating viruses. Yeah, I mean you viruses
*  Little tiny ones. Yeah, and Dave if they learn they can be pretty dumb, but on a mass scale
*  Dumb you don't have to be intelligent to destroy all of human civilization. So
*  So the real question about this artificial intelligence stuff that everybody seems to
*  The ultimate end of the line the what Sam Harris is terrified of is it becoming sentient and it?
*  Making its own decisions and deciding that we don't need people
*  That's what everybody's really scared of right? I
*  I'm not sure if everybody's scared of it. Yeah, they might be I think that's a story
*  That's the most compelling the sexiest story that the philosopher side of a Sam Harris is very is very attracted to yeah
*  I am also interested in that story, but I think
*  achieving sentience I think that requires also
*  Creating consciousness. I think that crew that requires creating the kind of intelligence and cognition and reasoning abilities
*  That's really really difficult. I think we'll create dangerous software based systems before then there'll be a huge threat
*  I think we already have them
*  The YouTube algorithm the Twitter the recommender systems of Twitter and Facebook and YouTube
*  From everything I know having talked to those folks having worked on it
*  The the challenging aspect there is
*  They have the power to control
*  minds the mass sort of what the mass population thinks and
*  YouTube itself and Twitter itself don't have direct ability to control the algorithm exactly
*  Like the one they don't have a way to understand the algorithm and two they don't have a way to control it because
*  But what I mean by control is
*  Control it in a way that leads to in
*  aggregate a better civilization meaning like sort of the Steven Pinker the better angels of our nature
*  So to encourage the better sides of ourselves. It's very difficult to
*  control a single algorithm that
*  recommends the
*  The journey of millions of people through the space of the internet
*  It's very difficult to know that and I think that intelligence
*  Instilled in those algorithms will have a much more potentially either positive or detrimental effect than
*  Sentient killer robots. I hope we get to sentient killer robots because that problem I think we can work with
*  I'm I'm very optimistic about the positive aspects of approaching sentience of approaching
*  General intelligence there's going to be a huge amount of benefit and I think there will be a
*  There's a lot of mechanisms that can protect against that going wrong just from knowing the
*  We know how to control
*  intelligence systems
*  When they are sort of in a box when there are singular systems when they're distributed across millions of people and there's not a single
*  Control point that becomes really difficult. Mm-hmm. And that's that's the worry for me is
*  The distributed nature of dumb algorithms on every single phone sort of it's sort of controlling the behavior
*  adjusting the behavior
*  Adjusting the learning journey of different individuals
*  So like to me the biggest worry and the most exciting thing is recommender systems what they're called at Twitter at Facebook at YouTube
*  YouTube especially that one that one has just like I think you mentioned
*  There's something special about videos in terms of educating and sometimes indoctrinating. Yeah, and YouTube
*  Has the
*  Hardest time I mean they have such a difficult problem on their hands in terms of in terms of that recommendation
*  because they don't
*  This is a this is a machine learning problem
*  But knowing the contents of tweets is much easier than knowing the contents of videos
*  Like we our algorithms are really dumb in terms of being able to watch a video understand what's being talked about
*  so all it's look all YouTube is looking at is the title and the description and
*  That's it. Mostly the title. It's it's like basically keyword searching. Yeah, and it's looking at the at the
*  clicking
*  Viewing behavior of the different people so like it figures out that the flat-earth
*  supporters enjoy these kinds of videos it forms a different kind of cluster and
*  You know makes decisions based on that by the way, it seems to make definitive decisions about you know
*  It doesn't like flat earth YouTube I think well YouTube in particular are they're trying to
*  Do something about the influx of conspiracy theory videos? Yeah, and the indoctrination aspect of them that
*  you know one of the things about videos is like say if someone makes a video and
*  And
*  They make it on a very particular subject and they speak eloquently and articulately
*  But they're wrong about everything they're saying. They don't understand the science say if they're talking about artificial intelligence
*  They're saying something about things that you are an expert in
*  There they could without being checked without someone like you in the room that says that's not possible because of X Y & Z without that
*  They can just keep talking
*  So one of the things they do whether it's about flat earth or whether it's about dinosaurs being fake or nuclear bombs being fake
*  They can just say these things and they do it with an excellent grasp of the English language, right? So they say it
*  They're very compelling in the way they speak
*  They'll show you pictures and images and if you are not very educated
*  And you don't understand that this is nonsense
*  And if you're especially if you're not skeptical you can get roped in you can get roped in real easy
*  And that's problem and it's a problem with some of the people that work in these platforms
*  Their children get indoctrinated and they get angry their children get indoctrinated
*  now what's interesting is
*  They get indoctrinated also with right-wing ideology and then people get mad that they're indoctrinated by like Ben Shapiro videos
*  So they'll get pissed off at that. Well
*  But you're okay with left-wing
*  Right why because you're left-wing so then it becomes like okay. What is a problem?
*  What's really a problem and what is just something that's opposed to your personal ideology?
*  And how who gets to make that distinction and that is where the arguments for the First Amendment come into play
*  like should these
*  Social media companies that have massive amounts of power and influence
*  Should they be held to the same standards as the First Amendment and should these platforms be treated as
*  essentially a town hall like where anyone can speak and there's a you know a
*  Platform and there's a real problem in that there's not that many of them. This is a real problem. The real problem is like
*  Twitter is the place where people go to argue and talk about shit and then Twitter maybe has a competitor on Facebook
*  But YouTube certainly doesn't have a competitor YouTube doesn't have any competitor. I mean, there's Vimeo. There's a few other platforms, but
*  Realistically, it's YouTube. You know YouTube is a giant
*  Giant platform. What is this alphabet reports YouTube ad revenue for the first time video service generated?
*  15.1 billion in 2019. Holy shit
*  I
*  Just looked up which ad revenue was
*  Supposedly around 500 to 600 million. Wow, that's a big difference. And what about Facebook Facebook is
*  stupendously
*  Valuable probably way higher than that, but this is the first by the way Facebook. I don't think pays like
*  YouTube paid for my McDonald's burgers yesterday
*  Yes, Facebook's not right Facebook is not in Twitter and Instagram
*  I don't think are paying you like directly but there's a lot of calls to break up Facebook
*  I'm not I mean I'm on Facebook, but I'm not on it. I don't use it
*  I just it's just connected to my Instagram when I post something on Instagram. It goes to Facebook as well
*  I know I never go to Facebook as a Joe Rogan Facebook group. That's
*  That's a dumpster fire of brilliant folks. Let me just put it that way
*  Look at this Facebook's revenues amounted to 21 point eight billion dollars
*  Jesus Christ just the fourth quarter the majority of which were generated through advertising the company announced over seven million active
*  advertisers on Facebook during the third quarter of
*  2019 and probably though also adds an Instagram that thing with YouTube is just YouTube not Google right YouTube premium
*  Yeah, and to be fair so the the cash they have they spend
*  Like Facebook AI research groups some of the most brilliant. It's a huge group
*  That's doing general open-ended research
*  Google research Google brain Google deep mind are doing open-ended research like they're not doing the ad stuff
*  They're really trying to build it's that's the cool thing about these companies having a lot of cash is they can bring some of the smartest
*  People and let them work on whatever in case it comes up with a cool idea like autonomous vehicles with Waymo
*  Yeah, it's like let's see if we can make this work
*  Let's throw some money at it. Even if it doesn't make any money in the next five ten twenty years. Let's make it work
*  That's the positive sort of side of having that kind of money
*  Yeah, that makes sense that there is as long as they keep doing those kind of things the real concern though is that they're actually
*  severely influencing the democratic process
*  So it's the it's difficult. I mean, it's certainly in Jack Dorsey Jack Dorsey in terms of the CEOs
*  Interactive I think was one of the good guys. Yes, I agree. Yeah, I mean he's he wants a wild west Twitter
*  Well, he doesn't know it he wants he wants a good Twitter
*  He's kind of thinking about Wild West but he wants his ideas have to
*  To Twitter one that's filtered and one that's like
*  anything goes
*  But I think he
*  The point is nobody knows what's what's the best kind of Twitter even having two Twitter's
*  I know you really want the Wild West you want the First Amendment to say free speech free speech for everyone
*  It's a difficult
*  Like the gray area there
*  You're just talking about YouTube with certain people like saying that I'm an expert in AI or autonomous vehicles
*  But I disagree with a lot of people if those people make videos and maybe they don't have a PhD
*  God forbid like are they not an expert either? Am I right?
*  I'm actually personally sick of the academic sort of cathedral thinking that just because you have a PhD and
*  Just you can be an expert like I'm not an expert. I'm an idiot
*  Do you feel like that that line is getting more blurred with the access to like all those MIT courses that are online and the
*  Extreme amount of data that's available to people that there are going to be a lot of people that
*  Even though they might not be classically trained they have a massive amount of information and have an open mind
*  Yeah, like the best, you know, I love like I like I've recorded a podcast, right?
*  Like what first of all shout out to Jamie for being incredible mastermind of audio production, right?
*  What sir? Thank you. Yeah
*  But the reason I'm getting giving a shout out cuz I suck so badly I didn't have to do it
*  I do it all myself and
*  But I learned that I do it, you know pretty good when you learn it yourself from scratch
*  It's like would you just sir with music and so on that long guitar?
*  Mm-hmm scratch you can learn with the online materials they have now
*  Yeah, you can become really good and
*  the the journey you take is not the
*  Traditional conformist journey through that education process you take your own journey and we have millions of people taking their own journey through that process
*  There's gonna be brilliant people without our PhD without ever having gone to college, right and
*  They I mean it's difficult to know what to do with that, especially about political questions like economists. There's these you know
*  Paul Krugman Nobel Prize winner
*  Economist
*  Harvard economists, you know, they're supposed to be the holders of the truth of the fundamentals of our economy
*  And when is there going to be a crash what's good for the economy is the left the right?
*  What taxation system is good for the economy, but nobody really knows say we'd like nutrition science
*  psychology
*  economics anything that involves humans is a giant mess that
*  Expertise can come from anywhere right like like Rhonda Patrick
*  I think she's pretty criticized for she's kind of young
*  Yeah, and she's I would say, you know, she's incredibly knowledgeable as one of the world sort of experts
*  But I think academia probably doesn't acknowledge her as an expert. She's like young. She recently got a PhD
*  I don't I'm not even sure she you know, like there's that kind of hierarchy that people there she's been
*  Unjustly criticized by people who don't even know her actual credentials. There was one guy who was criticizing her and saying well
*  She's not a clinical researcher. That's one of the things he was backing his criticism
*  I like no that's exactly what she is and she's been doing that for years
*  Like you don't know what the fuck you're talking about people get very touchy with her
*  Because she's young and also because she's incredibly brilliant like that lady
*  She brings stacks and stacks and notes when she comes here. She doesn't even look at them
*  She's rattles off all those studies off the top of her head she has a massive amount of data available and
*  She's very unbiased in her perceptions of things like her. She's all about
*  What do the results say what have the studies proven?
*  What can we learn from those studies and what do we have to take any consideration when we're we're assessing this data?
*  She's brilliant. She's she's off the charts brilliant and
*  People get fucking jealous and I've seen it I've seen it with weaker lazy minds in
*  Academia that criticize her that had at least at one point in time had a larger platform
*  I think her platform is bigger now and I'm happy that I've played a part in that
*  And I don't want to be a social justice warrior, but I have seen women being criticized more harshly
*  Yeah, a lot of domains of science. I think you're right. Yeah, well, you know, she's pretty too
*  There's a lot of things wrong there, you know
*  For that to like good looking beautiful guy
*  Funny yeah handsome. No, actually I get criticized as this guy's an idiot
*  Boring, why can't he be more like Joe Rogan?
*  What else you got there?
*  What else the notes wise? Yeah, I gotta talk to you about martial arts. Okay, I gotta talk to you about
*  Well
*  So I'm a huge fan of wrestling and a huge man a huge fan of the Dagestan region
*  Yes, and I've up getting a lot of shit for it posted that you know
*  Connor's gonna be cowboy before that happened. I'm also a huge fan of the different styles of
*  fighters in
*  You know me and I'm surprised how much shit actually Connor gets even though he brought besides
*  besides sort of all the
*  All the mess that came with him
*  He also brought an interesting style an interesting way of approaching fights and it's just style thinking and and also
*  philosophizing about fighting which I think is
*  Amazing and it clashes with the ideas of Khabib to me like the could be numbering a matter of it be
*  so I posted that Connor would be cowboy and
*  Well, I didn't know Dano's gonna say what's gonna say but face Masvidal and I thought he could beat Masvidal and then the biggest
*  fight ever 30,000 people in Moscow
*  With against Khabib for me like for me rematch would be the greatest getting past Masvidal
*  It's not easy and could be getting past Tony Ferguson not easy. Yeah, both of those fights and
*  First of all Masvidal is now gonna fight Usman, which is very interesting is very yeah, that's July
*  Very very interesting fight
*  Usman is such a tank
*  He's fucking terrifying. They hate each other
*  There's a lot of yeah, certainly
*  Certainly a lot of animosity a lot of shit talking
*  But it's also the more that happens the the better it is for both of them in terms of revenue generated
*  It's a really interesting fight
*  Now, let me tell you something when Masvidal was at the Connor cowboy fight when they put the camera on him biggest pop
*  From the crowd the biggest and all the people applause like screaming people went nuts. They saw him. They're like, yeah
*  And he was like
*  In that wearing that robe over. He's hilarious, dude
*  I mean, he's right look he's a slow starter in terms of his career like
*  Being recognized for the kind of fighter that he is now and also being recognized publicly as like a superstar
*  But his time has come he is here. He is a fucking star when that camera went on him
*  And the audience saw him that crowd went bananas the entire T-mobile arena. Just they went crazy
*  Yeah, that'd be I mean, yeah, we'll lose mom be an epic fight
*  But in terms of like the great I just think the maybe it's me the romanticized notion like rocky for mm-hmm
*  But Connor versus Khabib in Moscow. I can just see it with like
*  Putin and fador sitting there. I'll sit next to him. Do you think they would do it in Moscow? Yeah
*  30,000 people if Connor went to Moscow man
*  Good luck getting out of there if you win
*  Good luck getting out of there if you lose if you know, but I I he's so loved there
*  Khabib is so loved in Russia, but they I think Russian people also
*  Love MMA generally. There's a like the the fan the number of people that love fighting in Russia is huge and
*  I I know it seems like on the internet Khabib is like
*  They love Khabib and Connors hated but I think ultimately they love a good
*  What is a what's kind of call it a good heel? No, no a good scrap. I think he calls it a good fight
*  Yeah, yeah, so I think I think I'll be probably the biggest fight all time
*  I think actually Connor has a shot like this would the I love Khabib is probably my favorite fighter
*  I love that style of fighting. I like the
*  saityf brothers that
*  Frankie Edgar said mentioned to you about there probably the
*  Buvaj Sar say T. F is the greatest freestyle wrestler of all time. Just epic his brother Adam has a match against
*  Was like a soldier of God. What's his name? Yo, Romero? Yo Romero at the 2000 Olympics in the finals
*  Yo Romero looks like the most like if you were to imagine a tear the most terrifying opponent ever
*  He's just like shredded ripped and then Adam say T of looks like I don't know dad bod
*  very skinny like nerd and he just effortlessly like like
*  Destroys him really? Yeah with a trip like let me see that video
*  2000 the Olympics Sydney finals Adam say T of first of his name Adam
*  say to say sa I
*  T I EV
*  versus
*  Yo, Romero, you know Romero's fighting Israel Adesanya in March. That is giant
*  I can't I yeah, not too much of a nerd, but well, he definitely doesn't look as built as yo
*  Well, yo, well is a freak
*  Yo, L's probably the freakiest athlete
*  I think I've ever seen personally in terms of his build like his small waist he hugged that guy and picked him up. I
*  Was at the end of it
*  There's a couple moments where he take we scores points. Well, it's got him down here. I
*  Yeah, so he's up by four to one and I think once again he takes him down
*  Just started off in the beginning so we could watch it
*  There's a certain moment. I mean there goes just start it right there
*  They're basically technicians. Yes for sure when you look at the Dagestani people
*  It's such emphasis on technique, yeah everything else but also toughness
*  It's like they don't they have both things like and this one of the things that George St. Pierre told me about training in Russia
*  Excuse me training a much. Oh, what a takedown right there. Fuck. Yeah spectacular. Yep. Oh my god. It's amazing. Look at that
*  Yes, just I think those are like inner trip which you yeah, what you got eat up a trip. He covers his mouth
*  What George St. Pierre told me about training with Russian nationals in Montreal
*  He said they're so technical in that you get a lot of
*  Americans that that are definitely technical but they emphasize
*  Being hard and tough and grueling training routines and grinding butting heads and practice
*  And he said whereas the Russian nationals are far more committed to drilling
*  Far more committed to the technical aspects of exchanges and and and going through you know
*  One one technique after the other chaining these techniques together understanding the paths
*  Also the one of the at least to me one of the differences it could be similar to y'all Romero's actually philosophy
*  But the philosophy of the Dagestani the Russian people the Soviet Union is that
*  Is that
*  Recognition fame money all that stuff doesn't matter even winning doesn't matter the purity of the art is what matters
*  At least with the sitey of brothers is what they stood for
*  Well, that's that's mirrors what Khabib says about Connor that he doesn't want to rematch with him. Yeah, he's like fuck that dude
*  That's there. I mean, yeah, could be was a little bit more of the modern age
*  I mean he has an Instagram and Twitter and so on right he's he and could be
*  Despite what he says also does a little bit of trash-talking and you know, he's he still plays the game a little bit to change
*  His face. Yes, that's my favorite. Send me location
*  Whatever in just face most people say especially when I'm I'm here is basically if I'm if could be a did science
*  That's one of my favorite quotes he's ever said though, I want to change his face change his face is terrifying
*  It's terrifying because he can do it the the cool thing is with Connor that doesn't affect him the the the confidence he has
*  Mmm, the confidence that Connor has is just incredible
*  Well that he wants to do it again
*  Well, I know for a fact that Connor was going through a whole lot of shit before that fight and did not have the best training
*  Camp if he did an amazing training camp for this like he really prepared like he did for Connor or excuse me cowboy
*  The the cowboy fight his coaches were saying he's never looked better that he just was on fire and so
*  Focused and so
*  so accurate and and precise in training and that he was just on fire and that just seemed to be that all of
*  the
*  Bullshit and the distractions and all the things that sort of come with being the kind of global superstar that Connor is
*  He managed to figure out a way to get away from those and to just really concentrate on his craft and and pull everything to a
*  Championship level again and god damn it. He looked like it against cowboy and to see the contrast of those two cultures
*  I mean it is a rocky for type of situation
*  Yeah, the track because you better believe Connor McGregor will resume trash talk who knows he might not you might not he might not
*  I mean he didn't in this fight with cowboy at all. He didn't do any trash talking
*  I wonder if maybe he has learned and I wonder if you know his desire to beat Khabib
*  It clips is his desire to get inside of his head and play all the games that he usually plays and the promotional games that
*  Ultimately probably won't be necessary, but I think you know the UFC is trying to push for it right now
*  They're pushing for right now a rematch with could be but they're ignoring
*  Tony Ferguson in a lot of ways in my eyes, and I'm like that is the boogie man. That's gonna be exciting
*  It can go it can go anywhere. He's the boogie man dude. He doesn't get tired. He doesn't get tired
*  He slices everybody up. He isn't lost. He's lost one fight in
*  You know X amount of years and that was because he had a broken arm Michael Johnson broke his arm
*  So when you think about what Tony has been able to do to world-class fighters what he did to Donald
*  I mean he just smashed on his face. He he smashed Anthony Pettis
*  He smashed he smashes everybody Tony Ferguson is the goddamn boogie man. He really is
*  It doesn't get tired man, and he's get taken down and for sure
*  I'll get him down will do the his thing on him. He's not scared to be taken down
*  That's the difference between Tony and everyone else if he gets taken down
*  He might let him take him down and just attack off of his back and elbow the shit out of him off of his back
*  He's fucking dangerous off his back. He's hard to control. He scrambles very very well
*  He also has fantastic submissions he catches him from everywhere
*  I mean he catches triangle chokes Darce chokes his Darce chokes are spectacular
*  he's got one of the best Darce chokes in the sport and
*  He's he's not scared. Oh could be you get submitted my god. That would be crazy
*  What if he puts Khabib asleep look yeah, I don't think does he play a do you remember when Dustin Poirier caught Khabib and a guillotine?
*  Yeah, yeah, he did he caught Khabib and a guillotine
*  Listen that is not what you want to be with Tony Ferguson. You do not want to be in that position with Tony Ferguson
*  That's a different kind of guillotine. It's a
*  Dustin Poirier is primarily a striker clearly he has submission skills
*  He submitted guys before he submitted Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier is a bad motherfucker no doubt about it
*  but when it comes to pure submission skills, Tony Ferguson has an edge and
*  You know, he's a black belt and a tenth planet black belt
*  He's a master of submissions and a great wrestler and a great scrambler and the thing about him
*  That's so fucking terrifying is his cardio is all the things right? It's the striking. It's the the grappling
*  It's the submission abilities, but he's not gonna get tired
*  He doesn't get tired and his mind is impenetrable his mind's impenetrable people are looking past that fight fuck
*  No, not me man. I I don't understand it when I think he's talking about you know, look at everybody. He's fought
*  Beat the fuck out of everybody that's a Barbosa half held those on Joe's
*  Yeah, I mean he smashes people he smashes people
*  Yeah, I mean it's crazy that I would I would say if I
*  Would say it's probably could be his toughest fight. I think it is his toughest fight
*  I do I think that's puts you know
*  A lot of people put could be like in the close to the top ten of all time
*  He's in the top ten of all time in my eyes he's 28 no as a lightweight cares about the record you look at the people
*  You've beat sometimes we idolize people for the perfection of the record too much
*  Dude the way he rag dolled half out those on Joe's the way he steamrolled
*  Like I mean he's he's beaten top flight competition and made them look like they have no business being in there with him
*  But I think if you beat Tony Ferguson, I mean that yeah, that's a mess. That's a mess
*  Yeah, and people put him above like I don't know
*  I think Connor deserves to be in that story in that in that top like 15 top 10
*  perhaps perhaps
*  Jose Aldo. Yes, like beating. Oh, yeah. I don't know why people look past like Jose Aldo or
*  Eddie Alvarez. Oh, yeah, though the Eddie Alvarez fight was unbelievable like at least maybe I'm just
*  Biased in the sense that I thought there's no way that Connor beats Jose Aldo and then there's no way Connor beats
*  Eddie Alvarez moving up a weight class like I always thought he's gonna lose and being surprised makes me like up
*  Connor's ability my head. Well, he's phenomenal. It's with Connor
*  it seems to be a matter of how focused he is and
*  Who is he fighting and you know, where is he at in his life?
*  He's just his life is so chaotic. He's always filled with so many distractions
*  I mean think about all the crazy shit that he's done the throwing the
*  Throwing the the dolly at the bus and just all the nutty shit
*  He's done
*  But it's nice that he seems to be still hungry to fight even though he probably has a lot of money in the bank
*  Well, he certainly was hungry to fight cowboy. I mean he looked fantastic in that fight
*  Um, and again, you know, he's worth a couple hundred million dollars
*  It's so it's just the pure love of the game that your love of the game and that's kind of the ethic
*  That's the warrior ethos that could be comes from and that it's cool to see that mightify. Nobody's ever
*  Said anything in Russian actually probably in the Joe Rogan podcast. No, I don't think so if you ever need a translator
*  Okay, I'm your man. No, can I read a?
*  so
*  Satie have just a few lines in Russian. Okay, sure. So
*  Bovysar satie have would read Boris Barstin Ak which is a famous Russian poet won a Nobel Prize
*  Before every match and he kind of captures that ethic. So this is the poem. I'll say it in Russian
*  Okay, and then in English, please
*  Okay
*  Other people will follow your path again and again
*  But defeat from victory you yourself should not distinguish
*  It doesn't need in a dolikay
*  Pustitsa at least saw
*  No, bitch. I mean she will be my tolka. She will be told to the concept. I
*  Know there's a bunch of Russian people that appreciate that the translation a bit crappy. It's very difficult to translate the Russian language, but it's
*  The others step by step will follow the living imprint of your feet
*  But you yourself must not distinguish your victory from your defeat and never for a single moment
*  Betray your credo or pretend but be alive only this matters alive and burning to the end
*  So this is the end of a poem that represents the fact that fame
*  The most of the poem says that fame recognition money none of that matters the winning and losing
*  None of that matters what matters is the purity of the art just giving yourself
*  Completely over to the art so like others will write your story others will tell whether you did good or bad
*  Others will inspire using your story, but as the artist so in the case of pasta knock, he's a poet writer
*  Did wrote dr. Chavago the is the art?
*  you should only think about the art and the purity of it and the love of it and
*  So when you look at
*  Buhasir say Tiav and the brothers and that whole Dagestan region they shunned fame
*  It's like the thing that Khabib is thrust into this MMA world, which is fundamentally. I mean, it's a really it's a popular sport
*  It's an interesting
*  It's an interesting thing. I mentioned I think last time I was on here the most terrifying human being
*  You know investors when they like buy a penny stock seeing it's gonna blow up to me the most terrifying human being in the heavyweight
*  division the the Russian tank I mentioned last time the
*  Sadolayev who now just continues destroying everybody and it looks like he's already won the gold medal one bunch of world championships
*  He's a heavyweight the heavyweights in the and UFC should be scared
*  Is he gonna fight MMA so the the hard thing spell his name and let's get a video so we can yeah
*  It's there is Jamie's got it. Yeah, bam. It's think of I will never join MMA. No, hold on a second
*  That's not that's it. The MMA that's a that's part of the quote
*  That's and that's not that's that's not so
*  Yeah, I love so live that's closer to where he was chasing he's still chasing the limps just a 2020 Olympics
*  How do you say the name? How'd you say his first name?
*  Well, I just call him the Russian tank, but
*  it's
*  Abdul Abdul Abdul Rashid said alive. Okay, but
*  23 24 years old and
*  I think his tension is and he says he has a lot of close friends who are MMA fighters
*  He loves watching it. He feels a lot for them, but it's not
*  That what the very thing that this poem gets at he doesn't want
*  He thinks that wrestling the pure sport of wrestling is all about courage skill
*  Like he describes in this way. He thinks MMA also has to have this component of
*  So trash talk is showmanship. Yeah, and he is he doesn't he's doesn't like it
*  But I think that MMA needs that guy too, right the heavyweight Khabib
*  Heavyweight Khabib every Connor needs a Khabib like every
*  Every showman needs a person who says showmanship sucks. Every Ali needs a Frazier. Yeah Frazier, right?
*  Yeah, I think but this guy is terrifying. I think he would is he would do the same thing to the Khabib division
*  Again humble technique is everything but just a strength wise is also a monster is he really thinking about fighting or no?
*  It's hard to say it's hard to say because again one of the greatest wrestlers of all time really focused on
*  2020 Olympics throwing punches here. I think what's gonna happen is once
*  Likely wins gold at this Olympics
*  He's gonna he's gonna you know this this Titanic ship
*  23 24 year old ship is gonna start thinking and turning. Hmm, maybe there is artistry
*  Maybe there is skill and courage in and makes martial arts. Well, there definitely is
*  I mean, he doesn't have to do the trash talking thing
*  There's a lot of people that are very stoic that fight and they they don't participate in any of that stuff, you know
*  And then there's people that thrive on that stuff
*  I mean, it's it's really up to you the UFC doesn't tell you you have to talk trash
*  You know, I mean results are what matters right and it's not even trash. That's interesting. I think stories are interesting
*  Yeah, that's why
*  That's why people like like team sports like NFL
*  There's a soup. Did you watch the Super Bowl yesterday? No, I didn't. Yeah, what's a Disneyland? I
*  Wanted to talk to you about something that was at Disneyland. What's that? There's a new Star Wars ride
*  Yeah, this crazy Star Wars ride and there's the your it's a 20-minute ride
*  I mean, it's just crazy long ride and a lot of it you're in like a vehicle
*  Yes
*  And the vehicle is all programmed by computers the the direction of the vehicle the way the vehicle means it's very complex
*  There's no tracks
*  So you're riding around on this vehicle and the vehicle like they're shooting at you
*  The vehicle has to back up you go into this new door
*  The vehicle knows how to go around the corner and what's that guy's name?
*  Darth Maul is trying to cut through the wall spoiler fucking this this new ride is amazing
*  It's crazy how intricate and complicated it is and how far off the deep end Disneyland went to create this thing
*  I mean it looks so crazy. I mean you were like how much money this cost? This is it right here
*  So you're riding around in these things and stormtroopers are shooting at you and are there rails or no? No, there's no rails man
*  Everything is done by computer the computer tracks out the environment and knows where each one of these go
*  And by the way, there's several cars moving at the same time
*  So there's people in front of you they're in cars they get shot at and look at the fucking scale of this place
*  So that's one of them giant for
*  Four-legged robot things that's in Star Wars. So you're moving underneath them
*  There's giant cannons that you have to move through it's in rise of the resistance
*  It's trackless. Yeah, so this represent lies on the ground. There's some
*  Yeah, I think those lines in the ground are just the wheels going the same way over and over and over again
*  No, sorry, I just wanted to sort of commentate but they're probably not using the computer version
*  That's what so yeah, I think it's probably light our base. It's I don't know what it's based on but it's some the computer is
*  Coordinating all of these different things at the same time you go through this room and you're seeing battles outside and you feel it
*  You see the walls get hit like that. Yeah, like it's fucking crazy, man. It's it's amazing
*  Yeah, I mean the ride the line is bonkers
*  So the robotics aspect of this like the AI aspect of this is probably minimal
*  You can look at that. Look at that
*  Like you're in this thing you move through this room and in the background you're watching these starships
*  Shooting at each other and the whole time perfectly. Yeah, it's crazy man. Yeah, so really cool make this happen
*  I mean, these are people that are willing to probably invest hundreds of millions. Yes, like in this so guaranteed
*  So I think there's some
*  Like there's very minimal AI in this because AI creates uncertainty uncertainty is very undesirable in situations like this. Yes
*  Yeah, I don't think there's any AI in it, but there's some for sure. There's some sort of automation some computer automation
*  Yeah, but it's basic software. It's like it's software. Don't call this basic. Don't you dare?
*  Don't you dare Lex it's Star Wars. It's not even real. Oh
*  How who are you? There's reusable rockets being launched on a monthly basis and we're gonna colonize Mars for real soon
*  That's real, right? That's more interesting for sure. Definitely, but this is dope
*  So I'll be sitting on Mars while you know, I'll be here playing fucking Disneyland rides
*  And then I'll go home and sleep in a bed and breathe air
*  Yeah, fuck you'll be out there on Mars and the history books with no air remember you okay degrees blows it history books
*  I don't know. I actually don't matter once you're dead. Yeah
*  I mean, it's nice that we have access to the history books and I praise the historians for sure
*  But uh, it's not I'm not interested in making history
*  Yeah, I don't know actually why I said that cuz I don't care about the history books
*  I do just the exciting. It's one of the only
*  Frontiers that we can actually be explorers and like we've explored well the depths of the ocean weapon exactly right?
*  Yeah, but the outer space that's like
*  Man that's that's like the most exciting
*  For engineering and science that we can explore and the mind like yeah, like we don't know shit about the mind and exploring that with
*  neuroscience with AI
*  Mm-hmm just all of that the cut the cautions the all the other thing you talked about with boss term of simulation
*  Yes, got some I wanted to talk to you about that too
*  Because you brought up Ostrom
*  What are you boss from relies on I mean he was relying on?
*  Theories in terms of like mathematical theories of probability to
*  To say that he thinks it's more likely that we're in a simulation. Yeah, he has he has a
*  The thing he's articulated. I don't think he's come up with the idea of the simulation
*  He just kind of really thought about it deeply he came up with a simulation argument
*  Which are these three categories that he described to you possible outcomes? I think
*  The first one is we destroy ourselves before we ever create a simulation the second one is
*  That we would lose interest
*  In creating a simulation at some point and the third one is we're living in a simulation. Yeah, what do you where do you lean I?
*  think
*  to I
*  Think there's going to
*  The three paths that he highlighted it makes it sound like it's so clear that it's just three
*  But I think there's gonna be a huge amount of possibilities of the kinds of simulations like to me. I keep asking
*  You know at the ask Elon Musk. He's about the simulation wait. He said
*  What's on the other side? What's outside the simulation?
*  Yeah, I think I asked what would you ask an AGI system? He said what's outside the simulation is the question that he believes in it I
*  Or at least he entertains it as a troll the Elon Musk
*  embodies
*  Like the best of the Twitter internet troll a mean
*  And a brilliant engineer and designer in one it's like a yeah
*  It's like a quantum state that you can't quite figure out what's the coupling because I don't know if he's trolling
*  But I'm the same way I love asking people out the simulation even though I get a little bit of hate from the scientific community
*  But it pushes. Why do you get hate from the scientific community about the simulation because it's it's ridiculous notion if you think of it's like
*  Literally that because it's not a testable thing. We don't know how to test like why are you talking about this?
*  Why do you sit down with Elon Musk and talk about the simulation?
*  We when you're sitting with a world expert in particular aspects of rockets or robotics like I'm an expert
*  But I can't believe I just said that I'm not an expert anything, but I know a few things about Thomas vehicles
*  Why don't you talk to him about that?
*  Why don't we talk about simulation?
*  Well, the thing is the simulation pushes you outside of the muck the messiness of everyday details of science and makes you ask
*  big questions about like the nature of our reality and I I like to think of it is
*  Like what how would we build a simulation?
*  Like what would be a compelling enough virtual reality game that you want to stay there for all your your whole life?
*  That's a first step there. That's useful to think about like what is our reality?
*  What what aspects of the most interesting for us humans to be able to perceive with our limited perception
*  cognitive abilities interpret and interact with and then a bigger question then is like how do you build a
*  Largest scale simulation that would be able to create that virtual reality game, which I think is a possible future
*  We're already creating virtual worlds for ourselves on Twitter and social networks and so on
*  I really believe that virtual reality will will enter
*  We'll spend more and more of our lives in the next 50 to 100 years in virtual worlds
*  And the simulation hypothesis is a simulation discussion as part of that. I think I
*  Think there's the question of what's outside simulation is really interesting. That's the other way of
*  Because like what created us what started the whole thing? It's the modern version of asking
*  What the what is God? What does God look like?
*  What you know, it's it's asking what is the programmer look like I think that's a
*  Fascinating question but arguing that we're already living in a simulation. I think you've got stuck in that little point. Mm-hmm
*  I think it's not that
*  There's a bit of a language barrier to this. There's a technical. Yeah, I think
*  It's funny. It's funny Nick is a legit philosopher
*  Yeah, so he's been fighting battles in the philosophy game like you asked them does somebody disagree with him
*  Yeah on these hypotheses and there's a bunch of philosophers disagree with them
*  but including Sean Carroll on the philosophical level and
*  A lot of the arguments are in philosophy and then sort of technical and they're about language and about terms and so on
*  but I think yeah, it's very possible that we
*  We live in a we live in a simulation. I think
*  One of the this constructs of
*  so physics theoretical physics with many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics as Sean's talked to you about
*  Reveals some interesting sort of fundamental building blocks of our reality. There's something
*  I don't think people have talked to you about which is like the coolest thing to me the most
*  amazing thing that nobody can explain
*  yet things called cellular automata and
*  There's a guy mathematician named John Conway who came up in the 70s with a thing called game of life and
*  Cellular automata are these two-dimensional one-dimensional, but game of life is two-dimensional grid
*  where every single little cell is really dumb and it behaves based on the cells next to it and
*  It's born when there's a fuse when there's like a certain number like three cells alive next to it and it dies otherwise
*  Otherwise so it's like a simple rule for birth and death and all it knows it's it's nearby surrounding in its own life and
*  If you take that system with a really dumb rule and expand it in size
*  arbitrary complexity emerges you can have
*  Touring machines so you can simulate perfect computers with that system and it can grow and all these behaviors grow
*  like if you watch if people Google like a game of life and
*  You can watch this extremely dumb simple system just grow arbitrary
*  complexities and
*  what you start to
*  Realize that from such incredibly simple building blocks that don't know anything about the bigger world around them
*  You can build our entire universe. You can build the kind of complexities. We see it less so like we think like God is
*  Designing every little aspect of whatever of our world or a simulation hypothesis
*  The simulation is designed by hand like I'm gonna craft these things
*  What you realize is all you can all you need to do is just set some initial conditions set some really basic rules and
*  Allow the system to grow
*  As long as it can grow arbitrarily just crazy stuff
*  Amazing stuff can happen from like from simplicity complexity can emerge
*  And that for like if you study this a little bit closer
*  Just like watch it people can watch a game of life on YouTube and think about what it's showing like for 10 minutes
*  It'll blow your mind the fact that from
*  Simplicity
*  arbitrary complexity beauty can emerge is like
*  Incredible so for the simulation the creator of the simulation is probably some
*  13 year old nerd living in like in his mom's basement
*  It's probably just set some rules in this video game and press play and then arbitrary complexity can emerge
*  It can have a Joe Rogan. It can have an Elon Musk all the technologies that we've developed and probably
*  Millions of other alien species that are living throughout our universe
*  Jesus so the yeah that to me the cellular automata
*  Reveals that the simulation is a very simple thing
*  Reveals that the simulation is much easier to create than we might think and
*  But there's a lot of variability in the kinds of simulations will create like I think the simulation hypothesis things like you know
*  There's like one, but I think there's gonna be a lot of varieties. There's
*  There's there's a lot of possible different rule sets. There's a lot of different
*  Physical mediums in which these simulation could be created
*  It can be completely virtual world the role of consciousness whether you make most people conscious or not whether most of them are
*  Philosophical zombies they're just like non non-player characters, and it's just you or you have or is your mind simulated
*  like
*  the role of
*  suffering so consciousness brings with it this idea of of
*  Basically, you know subjective experience
*  It was subjective experience comes the idea of pain and fear and so on the thing again my Russian
*  Romantization of it, but I think fear of death is essential
*  Scarcity is essential for for me for life
*  Yeah, and that that's a nice feature of this little simulation
*  We got going on that there could be a lot of different alternatives. I think that could be less individualistic less less
*  Consciousness can be present in different kinds of forms
*  So I see there's a lot more options than those three that he highlights and we can destroy ourselves in a lot of interesting ways
*  The entire civilizations from AI to nuclear weapons to biological to all kinds of weapons. So it's almost like
*  Whether it's a simulation or not is almost irrelevant the complexity of the existence and
*  All of the various pushes and pulls that keep everything together
*  There they're almost
*  operating
*  like some grand plan
*  Whether they like it or not whether whether or not a grand plan exists
*  All these different things are happening and everything is moving in a very specific direction, right? It's moving towards
*  further complexity
*  Like I was having a conversation with a friend of mine last night where we were talking about phones and
*  We were like, you know, like when are they ever gonna look at a phone and say I think we're good
*  We don't have to the camera works great
*  Signals great and call people you can text people
*  Let's just stop innovating right here and we're both laughing like it's never gonna happen
*  But even though we admit like if you have an iPhone 11 or a pixel 4 is that we have
*  Yeah, it works they work great
*  You don't really need anything better like in terms of the way our culture works
*  You get so much done on these things you can bank on them. It's okay if I'm drinking all your waters, by the way
*  Yeah, we have a lot of water. Yeah, please
*  It's very polite of you this the just the existence itself
*  Whether or not there's a design to it
*  It seems to operate in a matter that would indicate there's a design
*  The design doesn't have to be real doesn't have to be a simulation
*  It doesn't have to be a grand plan, but it moves in this the same way as if it's a grand plan
*  It's weird. It's hard to put into words, but there's a different force and a momentum like the evolutionary process
*  The fact that life was created the fact that there's a kind of a progress and also
*  Like just like with the Native Americans
*  The the fact that suffering seems to be a constant story that was weaving in mm-hmm like we we constantly
*  progress, but we seems to be
*  Like creating the other and torturing and there seems to be constant suffering and war and so on through this growth process
*  and that seems to be
*  Death is a huge part of that and and conflict conflict even social conflict like we were talking about social justice warriors
*  And and that type of thing I think they almost have to exist
*  It's almost like the world creates a space for them and people find a way to fill that space
*  Yeah, the conflict by the way also. I don't know if you're even aware you're kind of
*  Even though you were thrust into politics, you're not aware of politics, but there is the Iowa caucus going on today
*  I'm the first vote for the Democrats. Yeah, so and Bernie's leading in the polls, which is interesting, but that's that that's the
*  That's the fun little we got Americans have their own little conflict going on here
*  Oh, there's always going to be conflict with all groups of people with everything
*  I mean there's conflict in the comedy community. I'm sure this conflict in the AI and
*  Autonomous vehicle community. There's this conflict. I mean and those things are critical
*  You know you learn from conflict if everything was just simple and easy and there was no resistance whatsoever
*  Nothing would get done and also your own personal systems would never get tested
*  I feel like every adversity that you experience is really a gift because on the other end of that adversity
*  There's an opportunity for massive growth. What was that thinking grow rich quote that?
*  Lovato Lovato said the other day every adversity carries the seed of an equivalent advantage. I
*  Mean yeah, just that
*  Yes, yeah
*  Just that way to see it that that's a beautiful quote how to write it down
*  I bought that book too. I'm gonna get to that once I'm
*  Worn out on Native Americans. I got about seven other Native American books
*  I've been so like I mentioned doing the startup right since August and
*  It's been it's been a bit of a torture like the self-doubt is pretty hardcore because I know because I've been failing non-stop
*  Like some trying to build spending most of my day programming and you're trying to build a her
*  Or a she whatever it is that she or her was it her her but no there's on that path
*  There's particular thing because you want to create a business you want to me, right?
*  You know you have to create tools that people would enjoy using on the path
*  That's a long journey to create a companion that can form a deep friendship
*  That seems so weird. It's it seems everything seems weird
*  until
*  Your life becomes better because of it. Mmm like
*  Flying cars seem weird. Oh, yeah
*  To me still in fact uber and Hyundai just partnered. They're still pushing this idea of flying cars
*  Electric VTOL I just feel like people are gonna slam into each other
*  Yeah, unless they are autonomous and they have like magnets so they repel
*  You know like they can't hit each other they get close and it's your and what happens when they hit like to me the
*  Like what does an accident look like it fall on your head? Yeah, you're hanging out in your house trying to watch
*  You know black mirror or also like currently most accidents people can walk away from like cars today are incredible, right?
*  And I don't know how you can walk away from a riot
*  Crash good question. Very good question. It's probably won't yeah fuck. That's scary. Yeah, but the any technology kind of seems
*  Awkward or weird you can you can be terrified of it or you can you know, you can think it's weird
*  Until it until it takes over. I mean none of us know
*  What that would look like to have a closer connection with AI systems
*  I don't know one of the things in this book that I'm in the middle of with
*  I'm actually towards the end of this black elk book as it details the
*  Invention of the automobile and the implementation of it. So recently world changes
*  That was the other surprising thing about this book is it's so recent. It's crazy really really recent
*  Yeah, so during this time where black elk was a young boy
*  Sees cat Custer get killed takes his first scalp
*  you know remembers the sound of the man gritting his teeth as he's cutting his hair off by cutting his scalp off and
*  then
*  Later on in his life as he's an older man the the world goes from very few automobiles to
*  Most people have an automobile during his lifetime
*  Most travel is by automobile. What does he what does he say about this world this this new world? That's not what you read the book
*  All right, because this is the I mean he doesn't even know about this world. He knows about the world of 1930s
*  I believe he died in the late 30s. It's just it's scary to be born not scary
*  but I don't know what it would feel like to be born in this natural world to see the kind of suffering and
*  the US military and
*  Then see the technology of the Industrial Revolution kind of
*  Propagate and be faced with that. I don't know what that would feel like. I don't know which world is better
*  Well, the world represents progress is a bright right? What is progress? Yeah, what is pro?
*  I mean, it's it progress seems to be inevitable complexity
*  inevitable never-ending complexity and then it there's this push towards that and I've always wondered if
*  I mean
*  Elon has this saying that human beings are the
*  biological bootloader for AI and
*  I've always thought that if you paid attention to the human beings
*  Desire for materialism like materialism seems to be like constant throughout cultures people want things and when they have things they want better things
*  They want newer things. Well that generates a consistent level of innovation inside that that civilization that culture
*  People are gonna make better stuff because people gonna want better stuff so they're gonna improve upon things
*  Well, if you just scale that and you keep going improving improving
*  What do you get to you will you get to something like artificial intelligence you get to something like, you know some sort of
*  Some
*  Some sort of an event some sort of a thing where the world changes and I think technology will help us ride that way
*  I'm an optimist in that sense. We talked about much, but I'm an optimist on Neuralink
*  I think there'll be a few exciting developments there. So Neuralink brain-computer interfaces
*  I think it's really exciting possibility there that Nick Bossman was too also skeptical about I'm more positive about
*  Increasing the bandwidth of our brain being able to communicate with the internet with the information
*  It doesn't necessarily need to be through brain-computer interfaces, but increasing that bandwidth to expand our ability of our mind to reason
*  not not to expand the ability to reason sorry to
*  Take the mechanism of our minds ability to reason and expand it with access to a lot of information
*  And increase that bandwidth to be able to reason with facts just like we can look up stuff on Wikipedia now
*  Increasing the speed of which we can do that can I think fundamentally transform our ability to think
*  Do you think that that's ever going to be a wireless option? Cuz right now they have to drill holes in your head, right?
*  Right. Yeah, I think I think there's could be others there could be other interfaces
*  I think yeah, I think so but also like I said weird technology holes in your head sounds
*  Terrifying right now, but it could be normal like ear piercing. Yeah. Well, yeah ear piercings. Yeah
*  But this is something standard like hey, did you get suited for neuro link yet? Yeah, Billy's only 13. He's not ready for neuro link
*  We're gonna wait until he's 16. He's like dad. All my friends have it. Yeah, come on dad
*  Yeah, I want to get fitted and just like surgery you take knee surgery
*  You take all surgery except brain surgery you take that for granted. Yeah for you. You're like, okay with it, but on the brain
*  It's yeah, it's scary sketchy. Can I cuz I know you probably gotta go
*  Yeah, we got last can I can I close it out with a poem? Let's do it. I'm that guy
*  Okay, cuz I've been doing the startup. I've been suffering. So I'm reading a lot of Bukowski. Oh
*  Bukowski poems you get drunk when you read them, of course some whiskey
*  Roll the dice vodka
*  Vodka is for friends and family when you buy yourself. It's whiskey. No, I don't
*  Man does not drink by himself
*  And you well
*  This man doesn't but it's more like relaxed thinking drink is whiskey vodka is we're going crazy
*  Okay, we're going we're going dark. We're gonna raid
*  and
*  pillage
*  Roll the dice or go all the way by Charles Bukowski
*  If you're going to try go all the way
*  Otherwise don't even start if you're going to try go all the way
*  This can mean losing girlfriends wives relatives jobs and maybe your mind
*  Go all the way it can mean not eating for three or four days
*  It can mean freezing and a park bench. It can mean jail. It can mean derision
*  mockery
*  isolation
*  Isolation is the gift all the others are a test of your endurance
*  How much you really want to do it and you'll do it?
*  Despite rejection and the worst odds and it'll be better than anything you can imagine
*  If you're going to try go all the way
*  There's no other feeling like that. You'll be alone with the gods and the Knights will flame with fire
*  Do it do it all the way all the way
*  You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is
*  Reading that pick up that piece of paper real quick
*  What's this? I got a kit fake it for Instagram. All right fake it for Instagram
*  People on Instagram that watch it will know fake fake look up
*  fake
*  That was awesome
*  Appreciate you brother. Thank you very much for coming in here. It's always a pleasure
*  We got to do it more often at ten more years. Yes ten more years. Bye everybody
*  You
