# Joe Rogan Experience #1960 - Andrew Schulz
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening, Big Don? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10.0s)]
*  What's up, my man? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=14.0s)]
*  Hey, first archery shot ever. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=16.0s)]
*  Oh, that was cool. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=18.0s)]
*  40 yards with an 80 pound compound bow, you got it right in the fucking vitals. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=20.0s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=26.0s)]
*  That's an amazing thing. You should probably quit now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=27.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=29.0s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the bow's not even set up for you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=30.0s)]
*  The way the bow is set up is for me, I have shorter arms than you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=33.0s)]
*  You would have a longer draw length, so you have to kind of like move your body a little, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=36.0s)]
*  and you'd sense that peep sight. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=41.0s)]
*  Bro, that's a long shot for a first shot ever in a bow, 40 yards in an indoor range. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=43.0s)]
*  And you got it right in the vitals. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=49.0s)]
*  Yeah. Now, what were you thinking when I struggled to pull it back? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=51.0s)]
*  Normal. It's weird. It's awkward. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=55.0s)]
*  Oh, that is a common thing that happened. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=57.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you didn't have any excuses, at least. Brian Cowan had a fucking... [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=59.0s)]
*  Wait, what did he say? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=62.0s)]
*  He's reading a scroll of excuses. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=64.0s)]
*  My labrum. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=66.0s)]
*  It's probably technique. No, it's a strength thing. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean, it is technique, but it's just 80 pounds is 80 pounds. It's a lot of weight. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=70.0s)]
*  I have a new respect for bow and arrow folks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=75.0s)]
*  It's hard. It's very hard, but it's really satisfying. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=79.0s)]
*  It puts in perspective the people who can do it on horseback. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=83.0s)]
*  You see it in the movies and shit like that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=86.0s)]
*  I don't know why I didn't think it was that hard. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=88.0s)]
*  That's a next level thing. The horseback thing is crazy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=90.0s)]
*  The Mongols would time their shot when the horse was in the air. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=93.0s)]
*  So when the horse was in the air, then they would release it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=97.0s)]
*  Oh, mid-gallop. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=99.0s)]
*  Yes. So there would be less disturbance, less jolt on their body. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=100.0s)]
*  So was that... [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=103.0s)]
*  We always talk about Genghis Khan and how he was able to take over the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=105.0s)]
*  Was the competitive advantage horseback weaponry? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=109.0s)]
*  They had a lot of things going for them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=114.0s)]
*  They had strategy, first of all. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=116.0s)]
*  They had devious, wild strategies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=118.0s)]
*  They would set people up. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=122.0s)]
*  They would send a small party out, and those people would go after a small party and chase them down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=124.0s)]
*  They would lead them into a canyon filled with Mongols and just slaughter everybody and block the exit. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=129.0s)]
*  They would hold a siege. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=136.0s)]
*  They would attack a city, and they would bring so much food and so many supplies. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=138.0s)]
*  They'd just camp outside the city until everybody starved out. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=145.0s)]
*  And then they would start killing people and lighting them on fire and putting them on catapults [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=150.0s)]
*  and launching them over the walls and light their own houses on fire with the dead bodies of people they killed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=156.0s)]
*  That's motivational. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=163.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=164.0s)]
*  Those motherfuckers killed 10% of the population. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=165.0s)]
*  That's the crazy thing. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=168.0s)]
*  I always wonder about these times. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=170.0s)]
*  What was the Roman Empire's advantage? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=172.0s)]
*  Some people chalk it up to roads. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=175.0s)]
*  Why was Genghis Khan so effective? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=177.0s)]
*  At a certain point in time, it has to be technology. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=179.0s)]
*  There was a lot going on. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=181.0s)]
*  There was the knowledge of the recurve bow. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=183.0s)]
*  They were really good at the recurve bows. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=185.0s)]
*  They had catapults. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=187.0s)]
*  And they just had, like, Genghis Khan just had this unquenchable desire to take over the world. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=189.0s)]
*  It's really crazy that, you know, no one's scared of the Mongols now. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=196.0s)]
*  But then when one of those dudes fights in the UFC, you're like, Jesus. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=201.0s)]
*  Wait, who's Mongolian in the UFC? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=206.0s)]
*  Let's see. Who do we have? The Mongolian murderer. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=208.0s)]
*  That's one dude. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=210.0s)]
*  But there's people from that Caucasus region of the world. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=212.0s)]
*  There's a lot of people from Kazakhstan and Dagestan. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=216.0s)]
*  So all the Stans are remnants of the Mongolian Empire. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=219.0s)]
*  Those guys that look a little Asian. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=222.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=224.0s)]
*  Rakhmanov. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=225.0s)]
*  Yeah. Shavkat Rakhmanov. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=226.0s)]
*  Shavkat Rakhmanov, yeah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=228.0s)]
*  That motherfucker's so good. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=230.0s)]
*  But they're just so tough over there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=232.0s)]
*  It's just crazy that they took over the whole world at one point in time, and then it all went away. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=235.0s)]
*  That's a lesson for America to learn. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=241.0s)]
*  Because Americans have this idea that we are the centerpiece of the military of the world. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=244.0s)]
*  This is it. This is the baddest fucking army that's ever existed, bro. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=249.0s)]
*  No one's going to stop us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=254.0s)]
*  But the reality is, like, every single civilization that has been in control has gone under. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=256.0s)]
*  They all go under. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=263.0s)]
*  Now, did those civilizations have nukes? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=264.0s)]
*  No. No. That's the problem. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=266.0s)]
*  That's the tricky thing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=269.0s)]
*  Yeah, the problem is if we go out, we go out ugly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=271.0s)]
*  But unless China is clever and they slowly dismantle our power grid [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=274.0s)]
*  and slowly pollute our country with bombing chemical factories and do it slow over a long period of time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=281.0s)]
*  Like, if you were a real conspiracy theorist, like one of them reddit tinfoil hat. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=290.0s)]
*  Let's go deep, my boy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=295.0s)]
*  You would think that China would not do a big thing, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=297.0s)]
*  but a constant series of small things that people get accustomed to. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=301.0s)]
*  You know, cyber warfare. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=306.0s)]
*  They would start hacking into Google servers, Amazon servers, crash everything. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=309.0s)]
*  Financial disruption. Crash power grids. Do it slow. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=315.0s)]
*  Do it over decades. You've got plenty of time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=320.0s)]
*  As long as you don't nuke United States first, they're not going to nuke you. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=323.0s)]
*  They're not going to. We already did that once. We're not going to do that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=326.0s)]
*  If anybody is going to be a first bomber, it's not going to be us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=329.0s)]
*  It's not going to be us. There's no way. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=333.0s)]
*  That's a problem. That's a strategic problem. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=336.0s)]
*  Because we're all worried about Putin. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=340.0s)]
*  We're like, what if Putin gets back to the corner? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=341.0s)]
*  What if Ukraine starts winning? What if this? What if that? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=343.0s)]
*  What if Putin really does have cancer? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=346.0s)]
*  What if he decides to go out with a bang? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=348.0s)]
*  Like, we're worried about that. No one's worried. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=350.0s)]
*  What if Biden just nukes China? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=352.0s)]
*  What if Biden's like, what's this? Tick-tock? You don't want to talk? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=355.0s)]
*  You don't want to talk? You don't want to tell us about the code? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=358.0s)]
*  How about this? Boom! Never. Never. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=360.0s)]
*  We would never think that the Biden administration would go and nuke someone. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=365.0s)]
*  Never. And they know that. And because they know that, they're comfortable. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah. So you could do sneaky things. I would do sneaky things. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=374.0s)]
*  If I was China or if I was Russia or if I was Iran, if I was some country that didn't like us, I would do sneaky things. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=377.0s)]
*  So is that the concern with Tick-Tock? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=384.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. There was some fascinating conversations today. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=386.0s)]
*  Because it looks like they're going to ban it. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=389.0s)]
*  For sure, they're not telling the truth. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=391.0s)]
*  Like, the way this CEO was talking to the senator today is like, oh my God. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=394.0s)]
*  It's like they just want to say whatever they have to say to get out of there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=399.0s)]
*  Like, he doesn't answer the questions. He dances around. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=403.0s)]
*  And the senator keeps trying to say, that's a yes or no question. That's a yes or no question. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=406.0s)]
*  Like, these dudes have been sending data to China from day one. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=411.0s)]
*  And they're doing something with that data. They're accumulating. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=415.0s)]
*  They're finding out how coordinated our kids are. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=418.0s)]
*  They got facial recognition on all of them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=420.0s)]
*  That's what the dances are about. They're just trying to find out how coordinated. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=422.0s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=425.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=426.0s)]
*  Wow. Every Tick-Tock trend is just a little bit of a little information about our youth. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=427.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=432.0s)]
*  Also how easily like led they are. You could get them to that app. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=433.0s)]
*  Well, cloud is the currency. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=438.0s)]
*  It's cloud, but they have so many things going for them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=439.0s)]
*  First of all, it's very easy to get a big following there. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=442.0s)]
*  It's very easy to get shared. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=445.0s)]
*  Instantaneous, it feels. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=446.0s)]
*  You can blow up. So that gets people excited about it and they use it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=447.0s)]
*  And it's genuinely a really good portal for creativity. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=450.0s)]
*  Like, some people do some interesting shit on there. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=455.0s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=457.0s)]
*  I almost think it's our fault it's successful because we didn't think of it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=458.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=463.0s)]
*  Like, we need some responsibility here. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=464.0s)]
*  Like, why is another country coming up with the best form of social media? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=465.0s)]
*  That's on us. We dominated social. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=469.0s)]
*  That's Adam Curry's theory. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=472.0s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=473.0s)]
*  Adam Curry doesn't believe it's any different in the way it gathers data than what the American social media platforms. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=474.0s)]
*  It's just a better distributor of that data. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=478.0s)]
*  He just thinks that, no, this is just China kicking our ass and we want to stop them from doing that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=480.0s)]
*  That we're not doing things that are that much different than what they're doing. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=485.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's true. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=488.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=489.0s)]
*  It's just Adam is very smart, though. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=490.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that there's something to that. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=491.0s)]
*  It's like you want to win the culture war and we've done that so well, right? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=493.0s)]
*  Like we had all these movies, these TV shows that like shared our culture around the world and that culture was romantic. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=496.0s)]
*  It's sexy. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=501.0s)]
*  You go watch fucking Top Gun. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=502.0s)]
*  You go watch Maverick and you're just like, oh my God, how amazing is it to be American? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=504.0s)]
*  How about when Rocky wins with American shorts on? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=509.0s)]
*  Got American flag shorts on? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=512.0s)]
*  The best. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=514.0s)]
*  A way game, too. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=515.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=517.0s)]
*  Like over there running in the snow. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=518.0s)]
*  The rushes that cheer it for him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=520.0s)]
*  If we can change, you can change. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=521.0s)]
*  We all change. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=525.0s)]
*  30 years later, same fucking problem. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=526.0s)]
*  Same fucking problem. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=528.0s)]
*  I remember when that problem went away. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=529.0s)]
*  I remember when the wall came down, we were so relaxed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=531.0s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=535.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=536.0s)]
*  Take me back to this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=537.0s)]
*  So there's a time. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=538.0s)]
*  When I was in high school, OK, in the 1980s, I was a freshman in 1981. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=539.0s)]
*  And back then we were terrified of war with Russia. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=544.0s)]
*  It was a terrifying fear of a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=547.0s)]
*  And break this down to me. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=552.0s)]
*  So it's like, is it you're watching the news and they keep is there like fear mongering? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=553.0s)]
*  Do you believe it? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=557.0s)]
*  Does it feel mispropagandist? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=558.0s)]
*  100% there was fear mongering. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=560.0s)]
*  There was a there was death. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=562.0s)]
*  Look, it's always been if it bleeds, it leads in the news. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=564.0s)]
*  You know, we talk about how bad the news is today. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=570.0s)]
*  But the reality is like five o'clock news. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=572.0s)]
*  When you get home from work, it was always the worst shit that happened. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=575.0s)]
*  Double homicide in Brooklyn. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=578.0s)]
*  It's always the worst shit of the day. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=580.0s)]
*  And also out of perspective, because it's the worst shit out of millions and millions of people. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=582.0s)]
*  Right. But the big one was always Russia. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=586.0s)]
*  And you would see the Soviet Union and you would see their leaders and you would see their army. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=589.0s)]
*  And it was terrifying. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=595.0s)]
*  They were the last great communist empire before China, right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=597.0s)]
*  Before China really blew up militarily. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=601.0s)]
*  Back then we weren't worried about China. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=603.0s)]
*  Everybody was worried about the Soviet Union. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=605.0s)]
*  And you felt fear. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=607.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=608.0s)]
*  I talked to my wife and she's younger than me and she felt the same thing. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=609.0s)]
*  And some of my other friends, I asked them, they grew up in different parts of the country and they were like, oh, yeah, everyone was scared. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=612.0s)]
*  Scared of the fucking Russians, man. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=617.0s)]
*  Like there was all those movies like Red Dawn where the Russians invade. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=619.0s)]
*  We kicked their fucking ass. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=622.0s)]
*  Send them back home. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=624.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=625.0s)]
*  You know, that was what everybody was afraid of. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=626.0s)]
*  And then the wall fell. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=628.0s)]
*  And so when the wall fell and the Soviet Union collapsed, we have to realize like that was a monumental change in the world. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=630.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=638.0s)]
*  People relaxed. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=639.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=640.0s)]
*  We relaxed. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=641.0s)]
*  I was like, thank God there's no more war anymore. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=642.0s)]
*  So what year is this? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=645.0s)]
*  What was the year was the collapse of the wall? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=646.0s)]
*  What year did they blow? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=650.0s)]
*  I want to say. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=651.0s)]
*  I want to say 89, 90. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=653.0s)]
*  So then the 90s comes on and then. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=656.0s)]
*  And then what year was it, Jamie? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=658.0s)]
*  89. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=660.0s)]
*  OK, so 90s. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=661.0s)]
*  So the 90s come along and no one's worried about war anymore. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=662.0s)]
*  Is there a cultural apathy? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=666.0s)]
*  Because there's a lot of bad things remain in the 90s. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=670.0s)]
*  Some of the worst American cars that have ever existed were made during the 90s. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=674.0s)]
*  We got real sloppy in the 90s. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=678.0s)]
*  I look at like one of the things I look about with America, like how in tune America is, is it what the cars like? [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=680.0s)]
*  What's the cars like? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=686.0s)]
*  So Space Race produces some of the most beautiful cars. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=687.0s)]
*  Space Race and psychedelic drugs. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=690.0s)]
*  So Space Race is what? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=693.0s)]
*  There's a direct correlation. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=694.0s)]
*  60s? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=696.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=697.0s)]
*  So you have all the cars that are coming out. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=698.0s)]
*  50s too. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=699.0s)]
*  50s, 60s. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=700.0s)]
*  Because 63 was when Kennedy says we want to put the first man on the moon. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=701.0s)]
*  So they're using all that crazy space influence or like spaceship influence on the cars. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=704.0s)]
*  And there's no restrictions, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=710.0s)]
*  Not much. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=711.0s)]
*  Not much space influence really. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=712.0s)]
*  I mean some of these big, like what is it, the big Cadillacs and stuff like that, they look like a fucking spaceship, right? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=714.0s)]
*  They do. Yeah, the old ones. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=719.0s)]
*  And there was no restrictions, right? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=720.0s)]
*  Like you didn't have to go, okay, it has to have this much gas mileage. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=722.0s)]
*  Right, none of that. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=725.0s)]
*  You could just make whatever the fuck you wanted to make. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=726.0s)]
*  And then, okay, so that goes away. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=728.0s)]
*  And then psychedelics are 70s. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=730.0s)]
*  Well, psychedelics are 60s. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=733.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=735.0s)]
*  In 1970, they passed this sweeping schedule one psychedelic act that makes all those drugs schedule one forbidden drugs. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=736.0s)]
*  All the drugs that are nontoxic like psilocybin, like things that your body makes like dimethyltryptamine, all those things become... [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=747.0s)]
*  That's DMT. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah, all those things become schedule one. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=757.0s)]
*  And then automobile design drops off a fucking cliff. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=759.0s)]
*  I mean drops off a cliff. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=763.0s)]
*  It's not totally... [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=765.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a correlation. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=767.0s)]
*  It's maybe not totally the cause because it coincides with the gas crisis. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=769.0s)]
*  So there's a gas crisis where there's a gas shortage. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=774.0s)]
*  Now you have to consider gas mileage in a car. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=776.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=778.0s)]
*  That's interesting. That's right. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=779.0s)]
*  So 70s is... [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=780.0s)]
*  What happens? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=782.0s)]
*  When do we remove the gold standard from the dollar? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=783.0s)]
*  That's... [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=786.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=787.0s)]
*  73 or something like that? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=788.0s)]
*  This is good tequila, dude. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=790.0s)]
*  This is yours? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=791.0s)]
*  Not bad. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=792.0s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=793.0s)]
*  It's good, right? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=794.0s)]
*  It's very tasty. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=795.0s)]
*  The Repo is crazy. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=796.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's very tasty. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=797.0s)]
*  I was prepared for some fucking antifreeze. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=798.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=800.0s)]
*  It was good. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=801.0s)]
*  That was good. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=802.0s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, and then we get... [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=803.0s)]
*  What is it? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=804.0s)]
*  There's the whole like petrodollar thing that comes on after that where they have to... [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=805.0s)]
*  I'm not aware of all that stuff. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=808.0s)]
*  I'm not good at that stuff. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=809.0s)]
*  I think this is just where we make the deal where it's like oil has to be sold in US dollars. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=810.0s)]
*  And now we have a backing for the dollar when for a while we didn't, right? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=815.0s)]
*  When we removed that gold standard. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=818.0s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=820.0s)]
*  Nixon removed the gold standard? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=821.0s)]
*  71. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=823.0s)]
*  And now we're in that situation right now where most oil is sold in US dollars and then those [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=824.0s)]
*  countries that decide not to, if we're going to get conspiratorial, those people who have [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=829.36s)]
*  decided maybe they won't sell it in US dollars, they have difficulty staying in power. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=833.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=839.0s)]
*  Actually, two ways. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=840.0s)]
*  That's always been the game plan, right? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=842.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=845.0s)]
*  FDR did it in 1933, but then also Nixon did it in... [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=851.0s)]
*  What do you mean then? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=852.0s)]
*  We should have a real economist work through this. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=853.0s)]
*  We'll fuck this up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=855.44s)]
*  But also, we could just talk shit and it doesn't matter because we're not experts. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=856.44s)]
*  So we're just saying nonsense. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=860.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=861.8s)]
*  It's so funny that people get upset by that. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=862.8s)]
*  Like, listen, this is a conversation that I would have whether or not cameras are on [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=864.44s)]
*  or not. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=867.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=868.44s)]
*  So you just got to be able to... [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=869.44s)]
*  Don't take us seriously. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=870.44s)]
*  Yeah, you got to be able to deal with that. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=871.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=872.44s)]
*  Don't take anything we say seriously. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=873.44s)]
*  Bro, especially us. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=874.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=875.44s)]
*  We're literal professional clowns. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=876.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=877.44s)]
*  I was messaging you, I think, about after we had Ben, Ben Van Kirkwick on the pod and [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=878.8800000000001s)]
*  Uncharted X, the guy who was the pyramid. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=884.8800000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=886.8800000000001s)]
*  He's great. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=887.8800000000001s)]
*  He's great. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=888.8800000000001s)]
*  And everybody was like, dude, it's so awesome. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=889.8800000000001s)]
*  Shane Gillis' dad showed up to the pod. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=892.5200000000001s)]
*  And I was like, what? [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=895.08s)]
*  And I guess they think that he looks like Shane, an older version of Shane. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=896.08s)]
*  But what I loved about the pyramid conspiracy is that the stakes are so low, right? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=899.8800000000001s)]
*  There's no pedophilia. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=904.9200000000001s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=905.9200000000001s)]
*  Nobody's dying. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=906.9200000000001s)]
*  Did it happen? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=908.4s)]
*  Did it not happen? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=909.4s)]
*  It's just how old is this civilization? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=910.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=911.4s)]
*  Is it 4,000? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=912.4s)]
*  Is it 10,000? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=913.4s)]
*  But you know that even with that, because Graham Hancock has a whole series. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=914.4s)]
*  They call you racist. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=916.4s)]
*  They call him racist. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=917.4s)]
*  I'm not saying that black people didn't still do it. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=918.4s)]
*  It's just older black people. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=920.4s)]
*  Listen, 100% was black people. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=921.4s)]
*  It was 100% people in Africa. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=923.4s)]
*  The pyramids were 100% built by people who lived in Africa. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=926.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=930.4s)]
*  All Graham Hancock is saying is that it's very likely that the entire world experienced [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=931.88s)]
*  a cataclysmic disaster around 11,800, 12,000 years ago, somewhere in that range. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=937.6s)]
*  And it knocked us back into the Stone Age. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=944.56s)]
*  But those people who were around before that were probably more sophisticated than we are. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=946.84s)]
*  We just have a hard time imagining that because we don't have any evidence of it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=952.16s)]
*  And we just don't think that the execution matches up with the technology. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=956.28s)]
*  We found some tech that would make sense. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=960.7199999999999s)]
*  I think that we could go, OK, maybe this did happen 4,000 years ago, or whatever it is. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=963.3599999999999s)]
*  But so far, the idea of a chisel and a stone carving all these blocks and then people just [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=966.9599999999999s)]
*  dragging them in the sand, I think it seems a little bit unreasonable. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=973.4799999999999s)]
*  There's some real problems with that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=976.0799999999999s)]
*  There's some real problems with the actual physical limitations of the size of these [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=977.8s)]
*  obelisks, where they're cutting them in the mountains and they have to move them hundreds [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=982.92s)]
*  of miles. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=986.92s)]
*  How are you getting them out of the mountains? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=988.28s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=990.92s)]
*  This is like 2,000 tons. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=991.92s)]
*  What the fuck are you saying? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=992.92s)]
*  You said it, I think I was listening to the pod with you guys, and you were like, if I [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=994.96s)]
*  was Elon Musk, I'd just build one. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=999.24s)]
*  And I get that to a certain extent. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1003.04s)]
*  I don't know if you could. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1004.76s)]
*  I really don't know if you could. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1006.8s)]
*  Do you know if you cut and placed 10 stones a day, it would take you 664 years to make [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1008.8s)]
*  the pyramid? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1015.6800000000001s)]
*  That might be wrong. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1016.6800000000001s)]
*  There's 2,300,000 stones in the Great Pyramid. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1019.52s)]
*  You need to go, man. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1024.52s)]
*  I know, I do. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1025.52s)]
*  You need to go. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1026.52s)]
*  It was the craziest thing that I've seen that humans have made. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1027.52s)]
*  Like awe-inspiring. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1031.04s)]
*  Talking to Ben, talking to Randall Carlson, talking to Graham Hancock, I more and more [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1032.04s)]
*  think that we just have to use our imagination. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1040.72s)]
*  We're thinking of technology only as technology that we've implemented, like these microphones [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1045.4s)]
*  and cell phones and shit, but it's possible there was a completely different branch of [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1051.4s)]
*  technology and they had figured out something that allowed them to manipulate enormous stones. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1055.88s)]
*  We just haven't figured it out yet. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  Just think about it like this. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1063.2s)]
*  Imagine there was this cataclysm. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1064.2s)]
*  Within 100 years, this idea of Wi-Fi is non-existent to people. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1067.0400000000002s)]
*  It's a story that you tell. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1072.68s)]
*  Wizardry. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1074.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1075.76s)]
*  It's just absurd. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1076.76s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1077.76s)]
*  You can't hold onto it. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1078.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1079.76s)]
*  Right now, we're looking for all these tools that you can hold onto and can build things [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1080.76s)]
*  with. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1081.76s)]
*  That makes sense to us, but we can't conceive of this technology that existed just in the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1082.76s)]
*  air. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1087.44s)]
*  How would you describe Wi-Fi to some dude that you met in an Amazonian tribe? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1088.44s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1092.44s)]
*  You couldn't. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1093.44s)]
*  You couldn't. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1094.44s)]
*  It's the same way that like, do you fuck with the chat GBT thing at all? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1095.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1100.44s)]
*  I don't even know what to ask it because I'm not familiar enough with what AI can do. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1101.68s)]
*  I would still ask it like Google questions because that's what I'm fluent in. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1109.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1113.04s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1114.04s)]
*  I think you can talk to chat GBT4 as if it's a god. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1115.04s)]
*  I would just ... I got some questions. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1120.8400000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1124.04s)]
*  Am I close? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1125.04s)]
*  Sure. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1126.04s)]
*  Maybe chat GBT5? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1127.04s)]
*  Can we chat GBT now? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1128.04s)]
*  If you tell it it's a god, it'll definitely start talking to you. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1129.6s)]
*  Can we talk to it now? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1132.12s)]
*  Yeah, you can talk to it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1133.12s)]
*  Hey, you know who invented Wi-Fi? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1134.76s)]
*  Who? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1136.28s)]
*  Hedy Lamarr. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1137.28s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1138.28s)]
*  The actress. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1139.28s)]
*  That's true, right? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1140.28s)]
*  It's not Bluetooth, right? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1141.28s)]
*  It was Wi-Fi she invented. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1142.28s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1143.28s)]
*  Hedy Lamarr, who was this gorgeous actress, was a brilliant woman who had quite a few [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1145.0s)]
*  inventions. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1152.7199999999998s)]
*  Technically both. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1153.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1154.7199999999998s)]
*  Lamarr was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for the development of her frequency [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1156.28s)]
*  hopping technology in 2014. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1161.64s)]
*  She did it way before 2014 though. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1164.6200000000001s)]
*  Such achievement has led Lamarr to be dubbed the mother of Wi-Fi and other wireless communications [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1167.44s)]
*  like GPS and Bluetooth. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1172.08s)]
*  Why did she invent this? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1173.84s)]
*  For playback or something like that? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1174.84s)]
*  No, I think she was a scientist before she was an actress. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1176.2s)]
*  She was just hot and no one gave a fuck. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, she is stunning. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1182.44s)]
*  She was so hot. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1183.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1184.44s)]
*  She was so hot. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1186.16s)]
*  Is that a function of our age? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1187.16s)]
*  Do you know Leah Lamarr, the stand up? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1188.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1190.16s)]
*  That's her relative? [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1191.16s)]
*  Relative, yes. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1192.16s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1193.16s)]
*  Because I had this bit about Hedy Lamarr in my act. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1194.16s)]
*  And Leah had to talk to you about it. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1196.44s)]
*  And Leah came up to me and she goes, I think it's her. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1197.44s)]
*  That's my grandma. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1199.04s)]
*  I think it's either her grandmother or her great aunt or something like that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1200.04s)]
*  It's one of those. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1203.56s)]
*  But yeah, that's why. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1204.56s)]
*  And Leah is beautiful too. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1205.56s)]
*  But Hedy Lamarr was a smoke show back when they were dragging women around by their hair [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1208.56s)]
*  back then. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1213.92s)]
*  Dark ages. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1215.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's like slapping women in the movies was standard. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1216.4s)]
*  Yeah, there was early Bond films. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1218.92s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1221.92s)]
*  Were wild, man. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1222.92s)]
*  You ever see Steve McQueen smack the shit out of, who is it, Ali, who was the woman [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1223.92s)]
*  he did that movie with? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1230.16s)]
*  Ali Sheedy? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1231.8400000000001s)]
*  Is that who it was? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1232.8400000000001s)]
*  I forget who it was, the actress. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1233.8400000000001s)]
*  But there's a scene where he's beating her fucking ass. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  Because he's actually hitting her. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1240.1200000000001s)]
*  And you could tell, she probably didn't know it was coming and she's got to be in the moment. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1242.52s)]
*  Ali McGraw. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1248.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1249.52s)]
*  It's horrible to watch, dude. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1250.52s)]
*  But this was like how men behaved. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1253.16s)]
*  Oh, this is the woman. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1255.32s)]
*  This is the actress. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1258.0s)]
*  Did you watch the, what is that, a show about the making of The Godfather? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1259.0s)]
*  No, I didn't see that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1262.32s)]
*  I know what you're talking about, but I didn't. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1263.96s)]
*  That was brilliant. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1265.52s)]
*  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1266.52s)]
*  Why is the perspective all fucked up? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1267.52s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1269.2s)]
*  The perspective, everyone's all narrow. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1270.68s)]
*  Everyone has narrow heads and shit. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1272.24s)]
*  It's too bad. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1275.28s)]
*  She was a beautiful woman. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1276.28s)]
*  Give me some volume. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1277.28s)]
*  Oh, you don't have headphones on. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1278.28s)]
*  Oh, okay, it's okay. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1279.28s)]
*  You don't have to give me. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1280.28s)]
*  It's actually playing Smack My Bitch Up. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1281.28s)]
*  This is horrible, man. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1283.28s)]
*  Like, he's actually hitting her. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1284.76s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1286.4s)]
*  He's actually hitting her. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1287.4s)]
*  And he's threatening to punch her in the face. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1288.4s)]
*  And she starts crying. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1290.44s)]
*  And he hits her again. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1291.44s)]
*  How common... [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1293.56s)]
*  This was normal back then. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1294.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'm wondering, like, how common when you were a kid was it to see, like, a... [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1295.56s)]
*  a man hit a woman? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1300.52s)]
*  I think it was normal. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1301.84s)]
*  I think for all of human history, it was normal until people started watching it. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1303.28s)]
*  And then going, what the fuck? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1307.96s)]
*  Until media came along. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1309.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1310.6s)]
*  And you could see, I think people hit their kids. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1311.6s)]
*  I think people hit their wives. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1314.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1315.0s)]
*  I think people hit each other. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1316.0s)]
*  What was the transition, though? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1317.0s)]
*  Media. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1318.0s)]
*  So... [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1319.0s)]
*  Because people got to see it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1320.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1321.0s)]
*  And you just got to see it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1322.0s)]
*  You didn't see what the kid did to get hit. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1323.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1324.64s)]
*  You just see the kid getting hit. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1325.64s)]
*  You see the kid getting hit. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1326.64s)]
*  You're like, how could you? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1327.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1328.64s)]
*  Like, you don't have to teach a kid. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1330.5200000000002s)]
*  You would never discipline. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1331.5200000000002s)]
*  Never. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1332.5200000000002s)]
*  You don't have to do that. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1333.5200000000002s)]
*  They want you to love them. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1335.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay, question. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1337.48s)]
*  They make mistakes. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1338.48s)]
*  You got to communicate with them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1339.48s)]
*  I have a question about that. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1340.48s)]
*  What about when they are... [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1341.64s)]
*  How do you communicate with a child before he understands verbal commands? [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1344.4s)]
*  And how do you communicate right from wrong? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1350.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, before they understand verbal commands, you're talking about babies, right? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1352.2s)]
*  They don't really... [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1356.64s)]
*  I mean, they can't even walk yet. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1357.64s)]
*  My daughter started talking when she was nine months old. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1359.84s)]
*  Is that early? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1361.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1362.8799999999999s)]
*  She's walking then, too. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1363.8799999999999s)]
*  She's walking and talking very early. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1364.8799999999999s)]
*  One of my daughters. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1368.08s)]
*  But the other one was like a year. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1369.8799999999999s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, when their verbal commands are just learning things, they're [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1372.36s)]
*  babies. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1378.04s)]
*  They can't do anything. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1379.04s)]
*  They can't even run away from you. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1380.04s)]
*  They're little tiny babies. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  So at that age, you're not even teaching right from wrong. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  You are. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1385.8s)]
*  You are. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1386.8s)]
*  But you're talking to them. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1387.8s)]
*  You talk to them with sweetness, but you always talk... [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1389.52s)]
*  I always try to talk to my children like they are an adult that I respect. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1391.04s)]
*  You're very sweet with the youth. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1396.8s)]
*  I think it's important. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1399.0s)]
*  But it's a side of you that I don't know a lot of people see. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1401.56s)]
*  You had your niece at the club the other night, and you were so sweet with her. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  It was a cool side to see. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1408.2s)]
*  The club is just fantastic. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1411.0s)]
*  The club is wild, right? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1412.0s)]
*  It was so cool. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1413.0s)]
*  It's a dream, dude. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1414.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1415.0s)]
*  It's a dream that I didn't even have. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1416.0s)]
*  I didn't even have that dream. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1417.0s)]
*  I didn't want to own a club. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1418.2s)]
*  Yeah, no comic goes into it going, I want to own a club. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1419.2s)]
*  And then you do it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1422.56s)]
*  But it was an interesting thing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1424.4s)]
*  I had this weird sensation. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1425.4s)]
*  I said it yesterday, but I was just like, I'm proud of you. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1426.4s)]
*  But I don't mean that in a patronizing way. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1430.52s)]
*  I'm genuinely proud of you. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1434.12s)]
*  But there's a specific thing, and I was thinking about this last night when I went back about [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1435.96s)]
*  the club. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1439.28s)]
*  You kept talking about this way of funneling and nurturing talent. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1442.52s)]
*  You're like, yeah, these are the comics that are going to come up, and we're going to invest [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1447.3999999999999s)]
*  in these local Texas comics. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1451.28s)]
*  And then they're going to go do these shows around the world or around the country. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1453.1999999999998s)]
*  We're going to send, what is it? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1457.0s)]
*  This is the mothership. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1458.8799999999999s)]
*  The mothership presents, and it's in all these comedy clubs around. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1459.8799999999999s)]
*  And I thought of the club, and I did both of the rooms. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1464.1999999999998s)]
*  And the rooms do separate things for committed growth. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1468.8s)]
*  That is really important. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1473.28s)]
*  That little room teaches intimacy and connection. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1476.24s)]
*  You can't just go up there and say words. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1478.9199999999998s)]
*  You have to connect with them. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1481.12s)]
*  Sometimes in big rooms, you can just say words. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1483.6399999999999s)]
*  And you don't have to connect because the connection is a little bit off. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1486.32s)]
*  There's a little bit of a filter so you can perform, which is another thing you have to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1489.36s)]
*  learn. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1492.84s)]
*  But the small rooms, which is a lot of the times the New York guys that we get really [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1493.84s)]
*  good at is like those laughs die quick. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1497.1599999999999s)]
*  So you better tag up that joke. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1499.4799999999998s)]
*  You better punch it up hard. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1501.32s)]
*  You better make sure you're cooking. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1502.6s)]
*  There's like a pace that you can kind of build. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1504.9199999999998s)]
*  So the small room, they get to learn how to really fucking put your foot on somebody. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1507.2399999999998s)]
*  You know, another thing that comes out of these rooms on the East Coast is the cold [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  weather. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1516.4399999999998s)]
*  Cold weather makes people impatient. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1517.4399999999998s)]
*  They don't want to hear your bullshit. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1518.4399999999998s)]
*  It's freezing outside. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1520.4799999999998s)]
*  They want to go, go, go, go, go. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1521.4799999999998s)]
*  Jesus fucking Christ. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1523.28s)]
*  They get inside. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1524.4799999999998s)]
*  They don't want to be, you'd be lally gagging. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1525.4799999999998s)]
*  He's like, if you even think about music and rap, like rap in New York, bar, bar, bar, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1527.56s)]
*  bar, bar. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1532.56s)]
*  In the South it's melodic and easy and chill and beautiful for both reasons. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1533.56s)]
*  But I thought about this more and then I did the big room first. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1538.28s)]
*  And I'm not going to be lying. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1541.76s)]
*  I was concerned about the big room. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1542.76s)]
*  You were concerned? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1543.76s)]
*  Because you said to me something about the big room. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1544.76s)]
*  You were like, no, it was fun, but you said to me, you were like, it's the most honest [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1547.76s)]
*  room. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1551.36s)]
*  But you're honestly hilarious. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1552.36s)]
*  Yeah, but. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1553.36s)]
*  So there's no issues. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1554.36s)]
*  That word, honest is usually used when like, let's have an honest conversation. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1555.8799999999999s)]
*  It's never like, you're beautiful. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1561.04s)]
*  Babe, can I be honest with you? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1562.04s)]
*  You're beautiful. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1563.04s)]
*  You're gorgeous. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1564.04s)]
*  You're amazing. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1565.04s)]
*  That's never, right? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1566.04s)]
*  So I was like, that's an interesting adjective to use to describe the room. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1567.04s)]
*  And then I went up and it was, it was awesome. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1573.4799999999998s)]
*  And there was an energy and there was an excitement and, and the room was great. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1576.4399999999998s)]
*  And it also offered this other side of standup that I think a lot of people that come up [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1581.0s)]
*  in the small rooms don't necessarily develop the skill set until they're on the road, which [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1585.5200000000002s)]
*  is filling space. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1589.88s)]
*  And it was like, you can learn to step on them. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1592.44s)]
*  And that's how I came up in New York and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1595.2800000000002s)]
*  And then you go do 3000 seats. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1598.38s)]
*  How are you going to fill that? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1600.8000000000002s)]
*  How are you going to absorb that? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1601.8000000000002s)]
*  And I was watching Ron White go up there and that's a perfect example of just like kinetic [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1603.48s)]
*  energy. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1607.7600000000002s)]
*  You're just watching him fuck. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1608.92s)]
*  He's like the Black Panther suit. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1610.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1612.76s)]
*  Just like absorb and everything, absorb everything and then push back. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1613.92s)]
*  That dude hits and holds punchlines better than anybody alive. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1616.8400000000001s)]
*  Masterful. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1620.52s)]
*  He hits him and he has a big ass fucking smile on his face. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1621.52s)]
*  You know him and like Tony Woods? [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1624.88s)]
*  You ever watch Tony Woods? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1626.3200000000002s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1627.3200000000002s)]
*  Those guys are masters at just absorb, absorb, absorb. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1628.3200000000002s)]
*  And then like, I don't know, I just feel like if that goal is, which what you said yesterday [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1631.48s)]
*  is like really nurturing this talent and like creating comedians that can be great comedians. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1635.64s)]
*  You've built a space that can do that. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1641.72s)]
*  Yeah, we built it specifically for that. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1644.44s)]
*  So instead of like making it so that there's big name headliners and you charge a lot of [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1646.72s)]
*  money for every ticket, instead of making money that way, what we decided to do is just [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1651.26s)]
*  don't think about that. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1656.5600000000002s)]
*  Just think about what's like what's the best place to develop comedy and how do we develop [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1658.44s)]
*  comedy properly? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1663.0s)]
*  One, you have to have open mics two nights a week. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1664.16s)]
*  So we have open mics Sunday and Monday. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1666.64s)]
*  And then we also have experimental shows where like crowd suggestions, they write them down [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1669.28s)]
*  on a piece of paper. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1673.68s)]
*  Oh, the bottom of the barrel. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1674.68s)]
*  Brian Simpson show. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1675.68s)]
*  Brian Simpson show, dude, that was. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1676.68s)]
*  And then you get bits from it. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1678.08s)]
*  Like the beauty of those shows is, I think there's a, Jeremiah has one, the Stand Up [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1679.4s)]
*  on the Spot 2. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1685.2s)]
*  And it's like, you get bits from that because you're liberated. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1686.68s)]
*  The audience knows that you're just getting this idea. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1690.28s)]
*  And that you're rolling with it. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1693.36s)]
*  They used to have one out here called the Riff that was good too. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1694.36s)]
*  It's a wheel. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1696.56s)]
*  You spin a wheel and it would roll and you'd like pick a card and it'll like land on a [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1697.56s)]
*  card. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1702.16s)]
*  Love. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1703.16s)]
*  That was a good move too. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1704.16s)]
*  It's like the whole idea is to be able to, you just, it's like a premise factory. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1705.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1709.12s)]
*  It's like, it's just like pumping out premises. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1710.12s)]
*  And you never fucking know, man. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1712.36s)]
*  I've had some bits that became like real good bits that I got out of doing those kind of [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1714.32s)]
*  shows. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1719.04s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to, I don't want to say the one we were talking about yesterday so [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1720.04s)]
*  you could develop. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1722.12s)]
*  But that's going to be, that's going to be one. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1723.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1725.84s)]
*  Like, yeah, there's those feelings sometimes where you say a line, you're like, oh yeah, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1726.84s)]
*  there's going to be something. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1730.24s)]
*  I really want to tell everybody. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1733.24s)]
*  That was so fun. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1734.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a good fucking line. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1735.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you want to give it away? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  I gotta keep that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1739.6399999999999s)]
*  But it was, it was just, man, it was just cool, man. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1740.6399999999999s)]
*  It was just, it was, there's an energy. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  There's an energy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1747.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, everybody is working towards the right thing. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1749.24s)]
*  Can you talk about, I think you're going to fuck the game up with the pay too. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1752.24s)]
*  That's, can we talk about that? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1757.24s)]
*  Let's not talk about that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1758.24s)]
*  We don't need to talk about that. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1759.24s)]
*  People don't need to know what people are getting paid. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1760.24s)]
*  You are a good man and you care about comedians. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1763.24s)]
*  I'll say that. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1766.24s)]
*  You won't say it. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1767.24s)]
*  Well, thank you very much. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1768.24s)]
*  But I will say it for you. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1769.24s)]
*  And you're going to fuck some people up with this shit. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1770.24s)]
*  Well, the whole idea is just to make the best possible place for standups to perform. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1773.84s)]
*  What Joe is trying to say is the whole idea is for him to make no money. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1778.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1781.84s)]
*  It's for comedians to make all the goddamn money. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1782.84s)]
*  Well, my idea is to make it so that, well, my only goal is the club break even. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1785.84s)]
*  I'm like, I don't care if it makes money. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1790.84s)]
*  I make a lot of money. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1792.84s)]
*  Do you? [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1793.84s)]
*  I'm worried about money. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1794.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1795.84s)]
*  I don't worry about money. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1796.84s)]
*  But I worry about- [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1797.84s)]
*  I shot a bow and arrow inside today. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1798.84s)]
*  I know you're doing okay. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1801.4399999999998s)]
*  But it's like, so that's not what I'm interested in. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1803.4399999999998s)]
*  What I'm interested in is like, what would be the best case scenario? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1806.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, I always talk about when we were kids, if someone said, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1810.4399999999998s)]
*  oh, if you had all this money, what would you do? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  I'd make the best fucking comedy club and I'd set it up just for comedians. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1816.4399999999998s)]
*  So I'm like, why don't you just do that? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1820.4399999999998s)]
*  So I just did it. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1822.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1823.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1824.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1825.4399999999998s)]
*  And the staff's awesome. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1826.4399999999998s)]
*  You've got the best people from the comedy store. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1827.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I already told you I was going to come down when you opened. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1830.04s)]
*  But I will say, after that week, like the energy that I saw from it, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1833.04s)]
*  I was like, oh, wow, yeah, something's going on over here. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1838.04s)]
*  Yeah, something's going on. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1842.04s)]
*  But listen, I was also one of these people who were like, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1843.04s)]
*  Austin can't sustain a comedy club. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1846.04s)]
*  There's not enough people. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1847.04s)]
*  I think I told you that. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1848.04s)]
*  I was like, I didn't know if it was possible. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1850.04s)]
*  Now, granted, you have a pretty good batting average with the things you care about. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1853.04s)]
*  Like so far, I think you're batting like a thousand percent on the things that you want to do. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1856.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, if you really like something and you do it, it's infectious. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1861.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1865.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, if you really love what you do, it's infectious. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1866.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think with Austin specifically, one of the things I didn't realize is that like, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  comedy is the professional sport here. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't have a basketball team. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1875.6399999999999s)]
*  You don't have a football team. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1877.6399999999999s)]
*  You have a college football team. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1878.6399999999999s)]
*  A dope soccer team. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1879.6399999999999s)]
*  You've got a soccer team, right? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1880.6399999999999s)]
*  But for people who are not gay, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, there's, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1885.24s)]
*  Oh no! [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1894.24s)]
*  You're going to run around kicking balls all day. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1895.24s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1896.24s)]
*  But comedy, I feel like, is the professional sport here. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1897.24s)]
*  And the people who are in that ecosystem have become the professional athletes. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1901.24s)]
*  Well, for people who are comedy fans, imagine that this happens. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1907.24s)]
*  Imagine if you're a comedy fan and the whole world shuts down, but Texas doesn't. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1912.84s)]
*  And then people are like looking at Texas like, how are they partying over there? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1917.84s)]
*  What the fuck's going on over there? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1920.84s)]
*  And then some people come and visit. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1921.84s)]
*  And then, you know, maybe some people know people who got sick and got better real quick. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1923.84s)]
*  And maybe some people start getting skeptical. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1927.84s)]
*  Maybe some people start saying, well, I haven't been sick in 10 fucking years. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1930.84s)]
*  Am I the same as some fat guy who smokes cigarettes? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1933.84s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is going on here? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1936.84s)]
*  And you get a little upset. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1938.84s)]
*  And then the government continues to keep you shut down. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1940.4399999999998s)]
*  You know what? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1942.4399999999998s)]
*  I'm going to go look at Texas. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  And then you fly out here and you convince 12 world-class comedians to move here too. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1944.4399999999998s)]
*  Now, if I was a comedy fan and I was living around here, I'd be like, holy shit, what is happening? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1951.4399999999998s)]
*  That's true. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1957.4399999999998s)]
*  Because that's never happened before. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1958.4399999999998s)]
*  All the scenes in our lifetime and in our predecessors' lifetimes were isolated. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1959.4399999999998s)]
*  There was the Boston scene, which is like a scene that guys would get really good at, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1965.4399999999998s)]
*  the good ones would leave, the Burrs and the Nick DePolos and the Me's and the Dane Cooks [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1970.04s)]
*  and everybody would leave. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1975.04s)]
*  You know, Louis C.K. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1976.04s)]
*  Patrice, Louis. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1977.04s)]
*  Patrice. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1978.04s)]
*  You know, they would all, Steven Wright, they'd all leave. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1979.04s)]
*  Right? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1982.04s)]
*  But it was an amazing breeding ground. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1983.04s)]
*  And then there was the New York scene, which is like a scene, and L.A. scene, which is [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1985.04s)]
*  like A minus. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1989.54s)]
*  Like New York was generally better quality of comics. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1992.24s)]
*  Because there was no other opportunity for anything else. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1995.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1997.04s)]
*  L.A. had the occasional Dom Herrera would stop in. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=1998.04s)]
*  Of course. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2001.04s)]
*  But there was only those scenes. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2002.04s)]
*  San Francisco was always a little shaky. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2005.84s)]
*  It never really had like a rock solid, big, booming scene. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2006.84s)]
*  But Austin does now. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2011.04s)]
*  Like it does. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2012.6399999999999s)]
*  And it didn't before. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2013.6399999999999s)]
*  It was a small scene before. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2014.6399999999999s)]
*  It was a good scene. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2015.84s)]
*  You know, like some good comics came out of here. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2017.74s)]
*  Brendan Walsh came out of here. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2020.84s)]
*  You know, like Hicks, Kinnison, they were at Houston and here. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2022.84s)]
*  But that was a long time ago. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2026.6s)]
*  That was the 80s. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2028.1599999999999s)]
*  What do you think it is? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2029.1599999999999s)]
*  Like all my favorite comics are from Boston. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2030.1599999999999s)]
*  And I've been trying to like understand why that is. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2031.6599999999999s)]
*  Because we grew up in a place where it's cold and no one gives a fuck. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2035.12s)]
*  And the women are very mean. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2038.36s)]
*  Dude. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2040.0s)]
*  No, no, there's something to that. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2041.0s)]
*  Like when the women also have a sense of humor. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2044.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2047.6s)]
*  Your mediocre sense of humor isn't. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2048.88s)]
*  Not good enough. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2051.12s)]
*  Good enough. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2052.12s)]
*  Not good enough. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2053.12s)]
*  You can't get laid with just regular jokes. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2054.12s)]
*  The girls are already funny. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2055.12s)]
*  Scotland's like this. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2056.12s)]
*  All my aunts and everything. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2057.64s)]
*  I bet Ireland too. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2058.64s)]
*  They are ball busters. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2059.64s)]
*  I had to learn comedy as like a defense mechanism because my aunts were ruthless. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2060.64s)]
*  Ruthless. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2066.12s)]
*  Just roasting my brother, me. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2067.96s)]
*  And we were just sitting there like, OK, I got to find a way to handle this shit. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2070.12s)]
*  That's funny. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2073.24s)]
*  But yeah, I've always wondered that with Boston. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2074.24s)]
*  And I asked a dude once and I was like, why do you think it is? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2076.92s)]
*  And he said the same thing. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2078.8399999999997s)]
*  But he also said, like there's an arrogance to Boston too. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2080.8399999999997s)]
*  This is where the nation began. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2086.2400000000002s)]
*  Like there's a, what is that? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2088.2400000000002s)]
*  They're like the aristocrats. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2091.32s)]
*  They're like the original aristocrats. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2092.32s)]
*  A guy who's like roofing in Boston still is like, yeah, but I'm from Boston. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2093.8s)]
*  And I wonder if you need that arrogance to also say the things that you want to say. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2098.88s)]
*  Sometimes you could be crippled by working class environments where you're like, I'm [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2104.34s)]
*  not any better than anybody in this town. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2109.12s)]
*  I'm not any better than just my friends. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2111.12s)]
*  I shouldn't go on stage and say that. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2113.16s)]
*  Who do I think I am to go talk in front of these people? [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2114.92s)]
*  You need a little bit of bravado to even go after it. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2117.76s)]
*  There's so many variables and so many factors. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2123.04s)]
*  But one of the factors is you need like a group of guys that are dedicated to comedy [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2126.0s)]
*  and are really getting after it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2133.36s)]
*  And they set the bar for everybody else. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2135.28s)]
*  That was what was happening in Boston. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2137.28s)]
*  It was Barry Crimmins. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2138.44s)]
*  I remember Barry Crimmins became my friend, but I was fucking terrified of that dude. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2140.28s)]
*  Because he was the standard bearer. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2144.92s)]
*  He would not let any hacks in. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2147.06s)]
*  He would be angry at you if you were a hack. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2148.56s)]
*  He was very well versed politically. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2152.3s)]
*  You couldn't have some bullshit argument conversation with Barry Crimmins. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2155.24s)]
*  He would destroy you. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2158.88s)]
*  He was ruthless. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2160.7599999999998s)]
*  And he was really fucking funny. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2161.7599999999998s)]
*  And he was just like, he had great political material, great social material. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2164.92s)]
*  He was a working class guy. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2168.92s)]
*  And he set the standard. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2171.2599999999998s)]
*  He was the fucking man in Boston. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2172.64s)]
*  I was scared of him. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2174.2799999999997s)]
*  I wanted to avoid him. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2175.2799999999997s)]
*  I'd fucking go around him. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2176.6s)]
*  Because I was an open micer. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2178.3999999999996s)]
*  I sucked. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2180.08s)]
*  And then when Barry Crimmins became my friend and told me he thought I was really funny, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2181.08s)]
*  I was like, oh, thank God. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2184.56s)]
*  Because he was the guy. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2188.4799999999996s)]
*  He was smarter than everybody else. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2189.4799999999996s)]
*  That's Barry. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2192.64s)]
*  He was smarter than everybody else. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2193.64s)]
*  And he had the highest standard of comedy. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2195.4399999999996s)]
*  He had the highest standard of comedy. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2197.12s)]
*  And he was a mentor for the rest of the group. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2198.8399999999997s)]
*  So you see guys that pop up like that in comedy. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2201.72s)]
*  Keith Robinson is another one. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2204.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's ruthless. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2206.9199999999996s)]
*  And he is ruthless. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2208.3599999999997s)]
*  He has the highest standard of comedy. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2211.2s)]
*  He's absolutely hilarious. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2213.2s)]
*  And he genuinely loves helping and putting people on. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2214.8799999999997s)]
*  100%. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  And it's rare that you get that concoction. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2219.7599999999998s)]
*  He's beautiful. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2221.64s)]
*  He is. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2222.64s)]
*  I don't know if people even know the stories of him driving fucking Kev up from Philly [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2223.64s)]
*  and driving a bunch of guys up from Philly and being like, hey, you need to come up here [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2228.0s)]
*  you need to be in New York because people are going to find out about you and you're [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2232.3199999999997s)]
*  fucking great. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2235.3199999999997s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2236.3199999999997s)]
*  And dude, he's had two strokes. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2237.3199999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2240.48s)]
*  And he's funnier. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2241.48s)]
*  I heard he's hilarious because he's just like going for it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2242.56s)]
*  Because it's like he's dying. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2245.72s)]
*  I wish I could say some of this shit. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2247.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2249.3199999999997s)]
*  Off, off. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2250.3199999999997s)]
*  It was in the Mitzis the other day. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2251.3199999999997s)]
*  Everybody was quoting shit. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2252.72s)]
*  I was holding my sides. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2253.72s)]
*  It is. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2255.2s)]
*  Wild. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2256.2s)]
*  And you can't refute it because he's not just saying wild shit to be wild. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2257.2s)]
*  He's coming from this place where it's like I had these strokes. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2261.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2264.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2265.0s)]
*  And killing. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2266.0s)]
*  I told him it was funny. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2267.0s)]
*  I told him I think they stroked you up. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2269.0s)]
*  I think it's like it's a benefit in a way. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2271.52s)]
*  Isn't it funny that it's almost like you need something like that to be truly free? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2275.04s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2279.24s)]
*  I did a theater in Miami once and Wanda, Wanda Sykes and Keith were on before me and they [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  both left me notes. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2289.36s)]
*  I was waving to them on the way in. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2290.88s)]
*  They were waving. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2292.6800000000003s)]
*  What's up? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  What's up? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  They both left me notes. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2295.6800000000003s)]
*  Wanda was the sweetest, nicest note. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2296.6800000000003s)]
*  It was great to see you. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2298.6s)]
*  I hope you have a great set. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2299.92s)]
*  Much love. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2302.36s)]
*  Keith Robinson says I hope you have the worst set of your fucking life. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2303.36s)]
*  I hope you bomb in front of your stupid fans. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2306.2400000000002s)]
*  Dude. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2311.32s)]
*  I saved that. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2313.32s)]
*  I have that napkin. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2316.32s)]
*  I still have that napkin. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2317.32s)]
*  What's interesting is you're making me think about comedy scenes and what makes it good. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2319.4s)]
*  You need a standard bearer. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2323.76s)]
*  It helps. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2325.82s)]
*  Multiple standard bearers would be ideal. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2328.82s)]
*  You definitely need at least one person. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2332.2000000000003s)]
*  You need someone who people will listen to. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2335.6s)]
*  That they respect. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2338.28s)]
*  But maybe isn't in the stratosphere. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2339.76s)]
*  Maybe they're not fucking superstar, megastar, movie star, but just is purely respected because [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2342.92s)]
*  of their standard. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2349.6s)]
*  That helps. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2350.6s)]
*  That way there's less jealousy. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2351.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2352.6s)]
*  Here's the other thing about it is though that in Barry's time, comedy was new. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2353.6s)]
*  We really have to understand our art form in a historical perspective. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2360.0s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2364.4s)]
*  In a historical perspective? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2365.6800000000003s)]
*  Our art form really didn't even branch off into what you and I do, into Lenny Bruce. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2368.36s)]
*  What is Lenny Bruce? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2377.48s)]
*  His era is late 50s, early 60s. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2378.48s)]
*  When did Lenny die? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2384.08s)]
*  When he died, the end of Lenny's career, and by the way, I'm a giant Lenny Bruce fan. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2386.2000000000003s)]
*  If you walk into my club, one of the first things you see is a big ass picture of Lenny [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2393.06s)]
*  Bruce. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2397.04s)]
*  He died in 1966. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2398.04s)]
*  You have to understand the last couple years of his life were completely entangled in legal [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2402.2799999999997s)]
*  battles. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2408.92s)]
*  The Lenny Bruce that we're talking about. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2411.36s)]
*  Late 50s, this guy literally invents an art form because it just didn't really exist that [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2413.7599999999998s)]
*  way. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2420.56s)]
*  Mark Twain did some spoken word stuff where he read some of his books and he was apparently [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2421.56s)]
*  very funny and people talk about maybe Mark Twain was the first stand up, the first guy [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2425.36s)]
*  to do stand up. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2430.7200000000003s)]
*  But then there was guys who just did jokes and they would tell two Jews walking to a [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2431.7200000000003s)]
*  bar, those kind of jokes. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2436.6000000000004s)]
*  Like the Morse Belt comedians that were coming up. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2437.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the Catskills. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2438.6000000000004s)]
*  They would all steal from each other. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2439.6000000000004s)]
*  It was like house jokes. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2440.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, house jokes. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  A lot of house jokes. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2442.6000000000004s)]
*  It was a lot of really dumb shit. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2443.6000000000004s)]
*  But funny, good times, whatever. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2448.4s)]
*  There was guys who could deliver in an amazing way. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2450.76s)]
*  Hack it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2455.04s)]
*  There were some of those guys that were killers. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2456.04s)]
*  They were killers. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2457.04s)]
*  Very funny guys. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2458.04s)]
*  But it's just like, what were they working with? [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2459.04s)]
*  They were working with stone tools. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2461.04s)]
*  And so then along comes Lenny Bruce. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2463.8799999999997s)]
*  And Lenny Bruce starts looking at society. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2466.48s)]
*  So it's looking at culture and sex and racism and drugs. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2470.68s)]
*  The race stuff that he has holds up today. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2475.7599999999998s)]
*  There are jokes that he's told. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2478.04s)]
*  There's a joke, because I think he would go on a road with a black dude who was like a [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2480.6s)]
*  jazz musician that I think would open for him. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2483.2799999999997s)]
*  And he would talk about the Frenchman. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2486.08s)]
*  He'd talk about white people trying to ingratiate themselves to his black friend and the awkwardness [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2487.68s)]
*  that white people have. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2493.56s)]
*  And the examples he's using, maybe today we'd be like are kind of hacky, but for the first [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2495.04s)]
*  person to ever say it, to see white people trying to win over a black person. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2502.8799999999997s)]
*  So we have some watermelon at the party. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2507.04s)]
*  Would you like some watermelon? [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2509.16s)]
*  That's a line that he has in it. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2510.16s)]
*  But he's observing whites at a time where whites are probably integrating with blacks [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2513.2400000000002s)]
*  way more often and then not really knowing how to do it and that awkwardness. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2517.7200000000003s)]
*  And then you got this guy Lenny Bruce who just fucking likes this guy. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2521.36s)]
*  Not that he's black. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2524.4s)]
*  He just likes this guy. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2525.4s)]
*  He enjoys the music. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2526.4s)]
*  He enjoys who he is. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2527.4s)]
*  And he's observing other people that just are the only thing they can see him as is [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2528.4s)]
*  a black dude. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2531.76s)]
*  They can't see past that. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2532.84s)]
*  So the only way that they can relate is what they know about black people. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  And now you see that same joke. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2538.4s)]
*  You see the white people awkward around black people. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2540.36s)]
*  That starts there. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2542.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2543.6s)]
*  Well Richard took that. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2544.6s)]
*  Like Pryor did that after Lenny did that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2546.52s)]
*  Pryor was like the better version of Lenny. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2549.6800000000003s)]
*  What Pryor was, was like what Lenny had started, Pryor was like I got this. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2552.96s)]
*  I'm going to take this to a new place. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2560.04s)]
*  I'm going to take this to a new place. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2562.04s)]
*  I'm going to make it way funnier. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2564.04s)]
*  And what Pryor did, it was like self-deprecating. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2565.48s)]
*  It was way funnier. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2568.6800000000003s)]
*  It was bleeding. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2570.0s)]
*  Lenny was very funny but we have to take it in the context of the times. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2571.0s)]
*  If we were back in the Lenny Bruce days, if you and I were us right now and we were sitting [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2574.52s)]
*  at our ages right now and we were just like regular guys and we're sitting in the back [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2580.02s)]
*  of the room in 1957 and we see Lenny go up and break down culture and society, we'd be [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2584.08s)]
*  like what the fuck man. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2590.44s)]
*  We'd be dying laughing. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2592.96s)]
*  He had this joke about gays. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2593.96s)]
*  Such a great joke. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2596.8399999999997s)]
*  This is the 60s? [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2598.0s)]
*  50s probably. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2600.0s)]
*  I mean he died in 63 is that what it was? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2601.0s)]
*  66? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2603.8s)]
*  What was it? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2604.8s)]
*  66. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2605.8s)]
*  So maybe early 60s. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2606.8s)]
*  So he has this joke and he goes dig, they make homosexuality illegal so what do they [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2609.1600000000003s)]
*  do? [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2615.32s)]
*  They arrest you and they put you in jail with a bunch of men who want to have sex with you. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2616.32s)]
*  They're testing you? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2620.28s)]
*  He broke that shit down in like 58. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2623.28s)]
*  What a punishment. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2627.4s)]
*  And bro it would murder. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2628.4s)]
*  People would be like oh my god what is happening? [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2629.4s)]
*  And then people thinking about like everybody always knows a dude's got fucked in jail. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2633.7599999999998s)]
*  Genius. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2639.08s)]
*  Yeah so it's like back then saying that though on stage when everybody else was like two [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2640.08s)]
*  Jews walking to a bar and Lenny was like breaking things down. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2644.6s)]
*  And then you're thinking about language and the culture and music and life and the romance. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2650.52s)]
*  That's interesting you say twain. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2657.6000000000004s)]
*  That you talk about twain. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2658.84s)]
*  And yeah you do see it with the writers that have like a comedic twist in their ability [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2660.84s)]
*  to kind of like analyze culture but not turning it into stand up. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2665.6400000000003s)]
*  They could though. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2668.88s)]
*  It's like a lot of them really could. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2669.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2671.76s)]
*  They would have to just learn how to deliver it which is not the hardest part because the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2672.76s)]
*  writing is like some of the hardest part. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2675.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah but sometimes I've noticed this with writers that they're so prolific on the page [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2677.88s)]
*  but when they try to communicate it it's a different art form almost. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2681.16s)]
*  It's like the ideas are there they just don't understand how to hold attention the same [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2684.6s)]
*  way. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  Well you know what it is? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2689.3199999999997s)]
*  They're out of shape. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2690.3199999999997s)]
*  I think it's a thing. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2692.92s)]
*  It's like playing pick up basketball. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2693.92s)]
*  The more stand up I do the looser I get on stage. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2694.92s)]
*  The looser I get on stage the more fun I have on stage the more fun I have on stage the [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2697.48s)]
*  more I'm inventing new stuff. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2700.36s)]
*  The more sets you do the better you get. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2702.04s)]
*  It's just real numbers. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2703.7999999999997s)]
*  If you're a guy who's like this awkward fellow who sits in front of a think pad all day writing [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2706.0s)]
*  on a Microsoft Word writing very funny things. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2712.0s)]
*  Occasionally you talk to your wife like what do you want to do for dinner? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2715.0s)]
*  Like you're awkward. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2721.0s)]
*  You're very brilliant but you're alone in front of your computer and then all of a sudden [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2723.0800000000004s)]
*  you have to go in front of people and deliver these ideas. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2727.48s)]
*  You have to learn how the delivery thing you have to put in the reps. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2733.12s)]
*  It's a lot of reps. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2737.92s)]
*  It seems way more simple than it is. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2739.2799999999997s)]
*  It seems when a person's up there like I was watching you last night it's like he's just [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2741.64s)]
*  talking like why is it so funny? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2746.44s)]
*  That's how people look at it like why is this guy so funny? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2749.52s)]
*  He's just talking. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2752.16s)]
*  I talk too. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2753.16s)]
*  I could do that. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2754.16s)]
*  I know how to talk. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2755.16s)]
*  But they don't understand. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2756.16s)]
*  Like you're just doing this magic show for them and they think it's just talking. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2758.52s)]
*  Isn't that wild that like it doesn't start as just talking and ideally we can break it [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2764.8s)]
*  down to the point where that's what it feels like. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2770.16s)]
*  Like it starts in our head there's like a premise and there's a line or there's a statement [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2773.7599999999998s)]
*  or there's like now I'm thinking of that joke that we won't say that you have and it's just [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2778.36s)]
*  like that's just a statement. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2782.56s)]
*  That's a feeling. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2784.12s)]
*  You know I was talking to my boy Mark and I was just like let's just like riff but don't [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2785.3599999999997s)]
*  tell me a single joke. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2792.12s)]
*  Tell me what you feel. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2794.16s)]
*  Tell me what is causing anxiety or anger. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2796.16s)]
*  Don't try to make me laugh. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2800.0s)]
*  Just tell me what you feel. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2801.2s)]
*  And every time that is the joke. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2802.64s)]
*  The punchlines will come and they'll insert themselves but that you're not going how can [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2806.3599999999997s)]
*  I make this situation funny? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2810.06s)]
*  That is how you fucking feel. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2812.24s)]
*  And that's why we laughed at it. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2814.36s)]
*  That's why you'll say it in front of a group of comics and we all laugh. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2815.84s)]
*  Not because you're trying to misdirect us. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2819.56s)]
*  Not because you're trying to trick us. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2820.92s)]
*  That's how you feel. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2822.6800000000003s)]
*  And we're all going yeah joke kind of does feel like that. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2823.6800000000003s)]
*  I might feel like that a little bit. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2826.84s)]
*  Depends on the lady. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2830.48s)]
*  Now you're giving it away. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2833.0s)]
*  But yeah that's I don't know that's to me like that's the beauty of like a great joke [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2835.44s)]
*  or like a great premise is the one where it's like you almost stumble into it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2839.88s)]
*  You're like emotionally engaged in it so much you're not even trying. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2844.56s)]
*  You almost have to think of it like musical notes. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2848.64s)]
*  Like there's all kinds of musical notes. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2852.2s)]
*  They're all good. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2854.48s)]
*  But they just serve different purposes and to make a great song you got to put them all [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2855.96s)]
*  together where it flows. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2860.44s)]
*  And that's like part of what we're doing too. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2862.84s)]
*  It's like you're gonna have those jokes it's like that's how you feel. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2865.48s)]
*  And then you're gonna have some jokes we take people down a left turn like whoops. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2869.12s)]
*  What about that. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2873.16s)]
*  And they're like yeah you know like that's that's a part of it too. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2874.4s)]
*  It's like there's a lot of stuff going on when you're doing comedy. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2878.6s)]
*  I almost yeah I almost think I memorize like people go how do you memorize all the words. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2881.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's like I don't think I memorize the words I think I memorize the song. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2886.88s)]
*  Yeah how it sounds. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah like how it feels in the rhythm of it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2892.08s)]
*  And I think that's why like sometimes when you like adjust to different room sizes like [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2893.8399999999997s)]
*  your rhythm can get off. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2898.32s)]
*  You know you go oh I forgot that section. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2900.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah because the song is different. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2903.6000000000004s)]
*  The song is slower the song is faster. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2905.8s)]
*  But I memorize the song in this was it pace or syncopation or whatever it is this rhythm. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2907.88s)]
*  Now it's a different rhythm. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2913.7200000000003s)]
*  I need to memorize it in this different rhythm. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2914.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2916.52s)]
*  Arena timing. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2917.6800000000003s)]
*  That's a perfect example. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2919.0400000000004s)]
*  Well I've never done arenas but like. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2920.6800000000003s)]
*  Well I want you to. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2922.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2922.88s)]
*  So let's do them together. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2923.5600000000004s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2924.44s)]
*  Let's fucking go. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2925.0800000000004s)]
*  What a crazy. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2926.48s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2927.64s)]
*  That's fucking go. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2928.92s)]
*  Come on man. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2930.16s)]
*  So what happens is it's slow. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2932.12s)]
*  There's so many people. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2934.24s)]
*  So you find yourself. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2935.8399999999997s)]
*  Like some punchlines you have to hang on to for a little bit. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2936.92s)]
*  But also like facial expressions are bigger. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2939.52s)]
*  You know and then there's giant screens everywhere where your face is where people could see it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2942.3199999999997s)]
*  And we're all together and when you're in the round the round is the shit. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2946.56s)]
*  Are you actively turning it. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2950.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2951.8399999999997s)]
*  So you're going OK I face this way a lot. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2952.3599999999997s)]
*  Let me give energy. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2954.96s)]
*  No no no no no no just go. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2955.96s)]
*  It just flows. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2957.52s)]
*  Just go. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2958.04s)]
*  No thinking like that. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2958.6s)]
*  But it's just like you're in the round so it's actually intimate. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2959.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2963.64s)]
*  It's like as intimate as you can get like 16000 people stuffed in together. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2963.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2968.16s)]
*  Because they're all looking at the people that are on the other side and we're all together. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2968.56s)]
*  It's not like a wall and a stage. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2972.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2975.16s)]
*  It's way more intimate. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2975.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2976.72s)]
*  It's like double intimate because you're surrounded. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2977.52s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2979.68s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2980.92s)]
*  It's my favorite way to do shows. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2981.52s)]
*  Really. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2983.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2984.36s)]
*  My favorite way. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2985.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2986.44s)]
*  It's my favorite way. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2987.08s)]
*  Huh. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2987.92s)]
*  I mean you can't do 16000 people all the time. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2988.88s)]
*  It's not good for your comedy. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2993.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2994.32s)]
*  What happens is you're not going to invent new lines. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2994.88s)]
*  You're going to stick to your script. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=2999.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3000.68s)]
*  You're going to stick to the bits. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3001.08s)]

*  You don't know what it is. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3037.48s)]
*  You don't know how it comes or how it doesn't come. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3038.6s)]
*  You got to respect it. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3040.6s)]

*  And if you put yourself on that schedule [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3079.52s)]
*  the muse will come to you and those ideas [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3081.2400000000002s)]
*  will enter into your mind. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3084.56s)]

*  You have to respect it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3087.76s)]
*  You can't just think it's a gift you get whenever you want [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3090.08s)]
*  to go and access it. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3093.44s)]
*  Bro that's like a lesson I learned with this trying [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3095.0s)]
*  to write new stuff since I put out the last special. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3099.52s)]
*  I was telling you this it was like really hard. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3102.0s)]
*  It's like really hard for me. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3105.0s)]
*  And I hadn't experienced that before in stand up. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3106.56s)]
*  And but I was just I just didn't want [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3109.44s)]
*  to like do a different version of jokes I'd already done. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3114.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3117.28s)]
*  And I feel like sometimes that happens like it's not [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3117.8s)]
*  necessarily bad like but I've done it for sure. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3120.24s)]
*  But I just really wanted the comedy [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3123.6s)]
*  to reflect what I'd gone through in life [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3125.88s)]
*  and how I'd change in life. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3129.32s)]
*  And that was fucking hard man to like sit there think [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3130.7200000000003s)]
*  develop new ways to attack these things that I [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3134.36s)]
*  haven't experienced before. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3138.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah your stand up is basically like a snapshot [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3140.6000000000004s)]
*  of who you are in that moment at that year. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3143.84s)]
*  But if I look at a special that I did from like 2009 [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3148.1600000000003s)]
*  very different person if I look at a special I did from 2016 [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3151.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm a very different person. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3155.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3156.6400000000003s)]
*  And so like it's just a snapshot and then you [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3157.36s)]
*  have to kind of figure out who you are now. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3159.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3161.6000000000004s)]
*  And all your new material has to be who are you now. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3162.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3164.5600000000004s)]
*  And if you're honest you acknowledge who you are now. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3165.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3168.32s)]
*  And I think some people or some comics they don't [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3168.82s)]
*  and then they get into that world where they kind of almost [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3171.96s)]
*  look like they're doing a an impression of themselves. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3174.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3177.0s)]
*  And the audience can tell. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3178.0800000000004s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3179.7200000000003s)]
*  And maybe they don't know consciously what's happening [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3180.84s)]
*  but they can feel it. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3183.36s)]
*  They don't feel like you're connecting with them. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah they don't feel because they're [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3185.44s)]
*  like oh you're doing this version and I never [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3186.56s)]
*  like I always valued you know Patrice [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3188.96s)]
*  was always kind of like my north star [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3191.44s)]
*  and I always valued like the authenticity. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3192.88s)]
*  Like what is the thing. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3194.76s)]
*  Like how do I fucking feel. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3196.84s)]
*  And yeah there was so much transition. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3199.08s)]
*  Like I mean I did so many bits early on about like chicks [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3202.2400000000002s)]
*  being annoying and then like I got an amazing wife [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3205.44s)]
*  that I love and I'm like they ain't that annoyed. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  You know what I mean. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3210.84s)]
*  Like you get a coffee in the morning like there's always [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3212.08s)]
*  snacks in the pantry. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3214.44s)]
*  It's not that annoying right. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3215.88s)]
*  So I'm like I have to be pure about what I'm going through [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3217.8s)]
*  and that was that was that was tricky man. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3222.08s)]
*  It was it like really feels good to be at a point [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3225.0s)]
*  where like OK now I've got some stuff that I'm like excited [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3227.6400000000003s)]
*  about that I want to talk about and like and I feel hungry [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3230.6400000000003s)]
*  but for a while it was hard man. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3232.96s)]
*  What is your writing process like. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3234.32s)]
*  Now I've become way more diligent. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3236.36s)]
*  So like before I would just go up and riff on stage [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3239.84s)]
*  and now it's harder for me to get up. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3242.92s)]
*  I make sure I do about I go three nights a week [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3244.52s)]
*  and I got to do at least four spots each of those nights [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3248.4s)]
*  so I can get to about 12 which I think is like a good amount [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3250.72s)]
*  of time to kind of let go. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3253.92s)]
*  And then off nights I have to also work. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3255.68s)]
*  So I just have to talk. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3259.84s)]
*  I either talk to myself I'll call up one of my buddies [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3261.12s)]
*  and I'll be like hey what are you working on. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3263.48s)]
*  Hey let's go just tell me what your things are. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3265.52s)]
*  Then I'll tell ideas that I have and like try to flesh out [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3267.2400000000002s)]
*  how I feel about it because I can't write the bit [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3270.48s)]
*  until I feel know how I feel. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3273.12s)]
*  Sometimes it takes me a little bit to feel. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3275.52s)]
*  So your process is like just a lot of thinking about ideas. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3277.52s)]
*  And talking. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3280.72s)]
*  Talking to people about stuff. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3281.56s)]
*  We have to just talk like getting I think [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3282.8399999999997s)]
*  that's why I enjoy podcasting. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3285.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like it's getting to how I feel about a thing [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3287.3599999999997s)]
*  and you say a bunch of things that are funny and absurd [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3290.72s)]
*  and crazy and salacious on the way. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3294.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3296.0s)]
*  But what is my core feeling about this issue. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3296.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3299.6s)]
*  And at that core then everything emanates from the core. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3300.44s)]
*  But if I can't get to the core I just have some misdirection [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3303.6s)]
*  that like I don't even believe in. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3306.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3307.7200000000003s)]
*  Once I get to the fucking the meat and potatoes it flows. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3308.54s)]
*  Everything just kind of like. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3311.84s)]
*  Yeah you find that zone. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3313.28s)]
*  You find that area where you're supposed to exist in. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3315.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3317.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3318.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah I can write from it much easier. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3319.54s)]
*  I can riff from it much easier. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3321.64s)]
*  Because I feel like I'm being honest with the audience. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3322.88s)]
*  Like every line is honest. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3325.08s)]
*  It might not be funny yet. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3328.56s)]
*  But you know I'm being honest. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3329.92s)]
*  You know that I'm telling you how I feel about this thing. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3331.52s)]
*  And I think that they're they'll attach themselves to that. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3334.7200000000003s)]
*  And then if I can catch you or I stumble across something [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3337.36s)]
*  it can hit. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3341.12s)]
*  But I need to know what I feel about it. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3342.44s)]
*  And I can't write about things I don't care. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3343.92s)]
*  Like the idea of like being like a and God bless them. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3345.82s)]
*  But like the late night writers where you just like [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3348.56s)]
*  they throw you some shit and you got to write a joke [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3350.76s)]
*  about it. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3352.76s)]
*  My brain doesn't work like that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3353.6s)]
*  That's like living off oatmeal for the rest of your life. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3355.48s)]
*  That's like you stay alive. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3360.76s)]
*  But you're going to eat plain oatmeal. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3363.36s)]
*  There's some guys fucking listening right now. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3366.2400000000002s)]
*  Plain oatmeal for the rest of your life. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3367.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3369.92s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3371.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3372.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3373.26s)]
*  Yeah I got to care. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3375.12s)]
*  I got to really fucking care. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3375.96s)]
*  That's because you care about what you do [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3377.8s)]
*  and that's why you're so funny. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  It's we all have to care about what we do. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3380.52s)]
*  And you have to I think everybody does it [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3384.56s)]
*  in different ways you know. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3386.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3387.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm always interested in the writing process. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3388.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3390.96s)]
*  Why what is yours? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3391.8s)]
*  You just go right like you'll just sit in front [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3392.62s)]
*  of the laptop and just write stream of conscious right. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3393.8s)]
*  I think that's important. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3395.8s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3397.48s)]
*  because some of the greats don't do it. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3399.52s)]
*  But if I really if I was going to teach a class [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  on creating stand up. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3405.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3407.48s)]
*  I mean look it's not like I'm the best stand up [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3408.32s)]
*  in the world so I'm not like I'm the best qualified [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3410.2s)]
*  to do this. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3412.24s)]
*  But if I was given this task to do that [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3413.08s)]
*  I would say you should do all those things. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3417.26s)]
*  Like there's nothing preclude there's nothing [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3421.26s)]
*  that keeps you from writing. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3423.0600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3424.34s)]
*  Like why don't you write. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3425.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3426.0s)]
*  And if you like you like to think about things [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3426.84s)]
*  and talk about things. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3428.6600000000003s)]
*  But what about what about sitting [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3430.0200000000004s)]
*  and talking to yourself about a thing. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3431.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3434.34s)]
*  And writing it. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3435.1800000000003s)]
*  And there's a very specific mindset that takes place [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3436.0200000000004s)]
*  for me when I'm in front of the keyboard [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3439.1800000000003s)]
*  and I'm writing an essay on something. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3441.7200000000003s)]
*  I can type so I don't have to look at the keys [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3444.54s)]
*  which is nice. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3447.46s)]
*  I don't type great but I type okay. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3448.74s)]
*  Enough yeah. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3450.58s)]
*  And I type enough. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3451.42s)]
*  And so I can just zone in on the page [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3452.24s)]
*  and I'm thinking about every word much longer [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3455.9s)]
*  than it takes to type that word. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3459.9s)]
*  Or rather it takes like it's like if I had to write [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3463.02s)]
*  something out. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3466.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3467.66s)]
*  If you're writing out a word. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3468.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3469.5s)]
*  It's so much more time to write it out [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3470.34s)]
*  than it is just think about that word. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3472.46s)]
*  So now you're chewing on it while you're writing it out. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3473.38s)]
*  Yeah so as you're writing each individual word [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3475.26s)]
*  you're pausing in time. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3478.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3480.02s)]
*  And you're like you're in a time lapse [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3480.86s)]
*  and you get to consider each and every possible way [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3483.32s)]
*  you would say something from that word [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3487.86s)]
*  while you're writing that word. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3489.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3490.6200000000003s)]
*  And there's a physical task of doing that [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3491.46s)]
*  with your keys and your fingers that makes you concentrate. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3493.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3498.0600000000004s)]
*  Because it fires up your synapses [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3498.9s)]
*  and makes you think that you're doing this [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3500.98s)]
*  with your fingers. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3502.82s)]
*  It's kind of exciting. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3503.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3504.82s)]
*  Especially if you have a tactile keyboard. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3505.66s)]
*  See like I use. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3508.46s)]
*  You hear it. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3509.62s)]
*  I use a keyboard that has a lot of key stroke. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3510.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3514.46s)]
*  It's like a lot of room. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3515.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3516.9s)]
*  That's why I work with a ThinkPad. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3517.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3520.22s)]
*  Now do you like clickety clickety clicks [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3521.06s)]
*  you feel it in your fingers. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3522.9s)]
*  So it's this tactile thing. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3524.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3526.1s)]
*  And then the words are up there [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3526.94s)]
*  and I'm thinking about the words [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3527.78s)]
*  and then other things come to me. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3529.26s)]
*  Do you find that you speak differently when you write? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3531.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3536.94s)]
*  Then when you talk to a person. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3537.78s)]
*  Right, definitely. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3538.86s)]
*  Well, you definitely, it's not natural when you write. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3540.46s)]
*  It's not clean. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3543.1000000000004s)]
*  But what you do is you take these bullet points [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3544.5400000000004s)]
*  from these various things that you wrote out [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3549.2200000000003s)]
*  and just say them how you would say them. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3551.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3553.5400000000004s)]
*  Say them how you would say them when you're right there. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3554.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3556.9s)]
*  You can't rely on writing to create great jokes. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3557.8999999999996s)]
*  But the ideas can come from that. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3563.22s)]
*  But the ideas. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3564.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a farm for ideas. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3565.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3567.62s)]
*  I need to have that moment. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3568.4599999999996s)]
*  For me, it's not sitting down, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3569.5s)]
*  but it's like, okay, there's a weird meditative state [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3570.74s)]
*  that I can get to if I'm running [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3573.58s)]
*  and I have a song that I know well enough [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3576.9399999999996s)]
*  where I can tap into my subconscious, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3579.4599999999996s)]
*  but not too well where the song bores me. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3582.4599999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3584.7s)]
*  And I get into a weird state. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3585.54s)]
*  Sometimes when I'm just running, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3586.38s)]
*  I hate it and it's awful, whatever. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3588.94s)]
*  And then sometimes I get into this state [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3590.58s)]
*  where I can lock in and create these other scenarios [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3591.98s)]
*  and I exist in these scenarios. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3594.2200000000003s)]
*  And I imagine this is what the super elite runners [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3595.82s)]
*  probably can access this for 26 miles or something like that. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3598.82s)]
*  I can't do that and I can tap in every time. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3602.98s)]
*  But when I can tap into that state, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3605.02s)]
*  I can create these worlds that I exist in. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3606.7000000000003s)]
*  And sometimes these lines come up, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3609.54s)]
*  these ideas come up, this curiosity comes up. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3612.1s)]
*  There's a part of my brain that now can flourish [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3614.54s)]
*  because other parts of my brain are accessed. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3618.38s)]
*  So it hits when you're breathing heavy, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3621.06s)]
*  when you start sweating. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3624.2599999999998s)]
*  My brain is occupied by maintaining this pace, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3627.22s)]
*  which is probably pretty fast, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3629.94s)]
*  but not so fast where I can't concentrate. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3631.14s)]
*  But that's occupied there. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3633.06s)]
*  And then another part of my brain is occupied by the music. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3634.1s)]
*  And sometimes I'll just replay the same song [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3637.02s)]
*  over and over again. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3638.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3639.38s)]
*  But there's a state. I love doing that. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3640.22s)]
*  Right? Something happens. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3641.58s)]
*  And it's like, I don't know what the fuck it is. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3643.42s)]
*  And I wish I could lock in on it [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3645.42s)]
*  and just exist in that for three hours a day or something. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3647.98s)]
*  But when I can, thoughts become really clear [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3650.34s)]
*  and ideas become really clear. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3653.7400000000002s)]
*  And sometimes they're fucking shit. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3655.1s)]
*  And then sometimes they're really interesting. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3656.54s)]
*  And I can replay these scenarios [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3659.06s)]
*  and think of an interesting comeback [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3660.6600000000003s)]
*  or this really self-deprecating thing that happened. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3663.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's just like, I'll literally hop off the treadmill, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3665.7000000000003s)]
*  sweaty as fuck, dripping all over my phone, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3667.7400000000002s)]
*  write the idea and then get back on. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3669.5s)]
*  But I don't know if that's a good strategy for doing it, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3671.5s)]
*  but these are the different scenarios [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3673.82s)]
*  to access that part of the brain [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3675.42s)]
*  that I almost feel like is always working. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3676.66s)]
*  Like, I don't know. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3678.78s)]
*  I always felt like comedy exists [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3680.26s)]
*  and then you just kind of find it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3681.98s)]
*  I don't think I've created any comedy. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3683.58s)]
*  I think it's there. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3685.34s)]
*  And I just kind of like, this is stupid, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3686.7s)]
*  but like, you know, like with the, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3689.38s)]
*  what is it, the constellations. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3691.42s)]
*  It's like the stars are there. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3693.14s)]
*  But somebody looked at them and they're like, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3694.42s)]
*  ooh, that kind of looks like a belt. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3695.82s)]
*  Ooh, that kind of looks like a dipper. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3697.46s)]
*  Right. You know what I mean? [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3698.98s)]
*  Yes, I know what you're saying. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3699.82s)]
*  That's kind of what I think with a lot of these ideas. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3700.94s)]
*  It's like all the things are there [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3702.7000000000003s)]
*  and you're just kind of like connecting these little dots. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3705.34s)]
*  Well, I think the more you look at it like that, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3708.02s)]
*  the more it becomes available to you too. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3710.7000000000003s)]
*  Because I think one of the traps of the human mind [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3713.5s)]
*  is that when you get good at something, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3718.2200000000003s)]
*  your ego inflates and you think it's about you [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3720.58s)]
*  and you're just a special thing [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3725.38s)]
*  and you're better than everybody. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3727.42s)]
*  And there's a way that you could do it [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3729.34s)]
*  that nobody can fuck with. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3731.6200000000003s)]
*  And there's a thing that it's like a normal thing [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3732.46s)]
*  that people do. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3734.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3735.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think that that invades your creative process. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3736.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3741.02s)]
*  You create an expectation for yourself. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3741.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3743.5s)]
*  I'll be honest, that's why I took some time away. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3744.5800000000004s)]
*  It was like, I just wanted to create, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3746.7000000000003s)]
*  like I don't let any friends come see me. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3749.34s)]
*  I don't let anybody come see me. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3750.7400000000002s)]
*  Like when I'm in creation mode, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3752.02s)]
*  it's so weird because obviously the people will come out, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3753.86s)]
*  but like I just, I want some time for me [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3755.6600000000003s)]
*  and I don't want to be there thinking like, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3761.5400000000004s)]
*  oh God, is my wife gonna be upset that I say this thing? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3764.1000000000004s)]
*  Because that stops the tag that might be too far, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3766.82s)]
*  it might be too wild or it might be perfect [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3772.78s)]
*  or like, okay, I can find it. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3774.94s)]
*  Like I want to create [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3776.46s)]
*  and not have a fucking care in the world. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3778.02s)]
*  I don't know, you said something to me yesterday [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3781.26s)]
*  that was like, you don't want to be any more famous. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3783.6600000000003s)]
*  And it was like, it's a wild thing to say, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3787.42s)]
*  but I get it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3791.58s)]
*  Cause it's like the more that comes with it, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3793.22s)]
*  maybe the more restriction you feel. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3797.02s)]
*  Well, you're more susceptible to criticism. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3799.7s)]
*  You're more susceptible to people being upset with you. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3804.78s)]
*  You're more susceptible to people thinking [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3807.46s)]
*  that it's not fair, cause it's not fair. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3809.3s)]
*  There's no fair, that's what's weird about life. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3812.18s)]
*  So the weirdest things, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3815.22s)]
*  like it doesn't necessarily make sense [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3816.4599999999996s)]
*  what becomes successful and what's not [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3819.2999999999997s)]
*  and who's making money and who's not. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3821.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not about how much effort you're putting in. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3823.8599999999997s)]
*  It's not about that. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3826.2599999999998s)]
*  Like it's a weird game we're all playing. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3827.7s)]
*  And the more successful you get, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3831.2599999999998s)]
*  and they're like, would you want to be the richest guy [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3833.4199999999996s)]
*  in the world? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3835.3799999999997s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3836.22s)]
*  Is he living any better than number 39? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3837.8999999999996s)]
*  They leave 39 alone. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3840.3399999999997s)]
*  39 is probably worth five billion. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3842.9s)]
*  That dude's chilling. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3846.2200000000003s)]
*  What do they say about that? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3847.7000000000003s)]
*  They don't say jack shit about that guy. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3848.54s)]
*  That guy's eating filet mignon and drinking Dom Perignon. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3850.14s)]
*  Same jets. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3853.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3854.3s)]
*  Same hotels. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3855.14s)]
*  Having a great last time. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3855.98s)]
*  Great time. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3856.98s)]
*  Same Instagram models. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3857.82s)]
*  Exactly the same shit. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3858.7400000000002s)]
*  Like with no scrutiny. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3860.14s)]
*  Nothing's different. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3861.14s)]
*  Same pure cocaine straight out of Columbia. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3861.98s)]

*  Like the purest fucking brick cocaine [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3870.9s)]

*  used to snort in the 70s. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3876.38s)]
*  Peter, I don't know if you did coke. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3880.98s)]
*  I'm sorry, I should have said somebody else. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3882.46s)]

*  Who definitely snorted coke in the 70s? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3889.38s)]
*  In the 70s? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3891.2200000000003s)]
*  Fucking John Travolta. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3892.2200000000003s)]

*  It was a massage. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3904.26s)]
*  Snorting coke and getting massages. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3906.1800000000003s)]

*  I was kept high. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3936.46s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3937.98s)]
*  Unless they were holding you down [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3938.8199999999997s)]
*  and making you snort it off that stripper's tits, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3941.98s)]
*  then there's no fucking way that you could say [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3945.94s)]
*  that they did that to you, sir. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3949.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3951.74s)]
*  Right? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3953.22s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder if they gotta look back [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3954.2599999999998s)]
*  and like they don't wanna take responsibility [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3955.7s)]
*  for what they did. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3957.7s)]
*  Well, it must be awful to like have had everything [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3959.46s)]
*  ripped away from you because you became a cocaine addict [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3963.54s)]
*  because you got into heroin. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3967.7s)]
*  Imagine just like you have a functional existence, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3970.14s)]
*  everything's great, you're doing a thing [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3973.46s)]
*  whether it's rock and roll music or whatever it is [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3975.94s)]
*  and then all of a sudden things start going well. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3978.3399999999997s)]
*  You're doing shows and you just like to get high [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3980.9s)]
*  and you're just getting high a lot [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3984.3399999999997s)]
*  and you're just like doing shows like I need a bump [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3986.02s)]
*  before I go up and next thing you know, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3988.02s)]
*  you're getting high every night and you're just wrecked [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3990.54s)]
*  and your immune system is wrecked and your body's wrecked [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3993.66s)]
*  and you're always like implementing chemicals. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3996.7400000000002s)]
*  It's always alcohol to sleep and maybe Ambien [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=3999.82s)]
*  and cocaine to wake up. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4003.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4005.38s)]
*  You know, you're living three, four years to every one year. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4006.22s)]
*  Every one year you've got three or four years of damage [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4009.62s)]
*  because you're going so hard [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4013.66s)]
*  and then you don't wanna think it was just you [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4015.54s)]
*  and it's not just you because it's addictive. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4020.26s)]
*  It's like a real, it's a problem. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4022.26s)]
*  It's like saying, telling someone they have the flu, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4023.7s)]
*  like well you should be sick. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4026.46s)]
*  Like okay, that's not helping them. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4028.54s)]
*  They're addicted, they're like physically addicted to coke [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4030.62s)]
*  and we wanna categorize that as like being a mental weakness [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4034.5s)]
*  or we wanna categorize that as being you're totally helpless [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4037.78s)]
*  and that the addiction has overwhelmed you. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4041.26s)]
*  I suspect it's a combination of the two things. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4044.74s)]
*  I suspect that's why there's such polarizing camps [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4048.8599999999997s)]
*  between the idea that it's not your fault at all [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4052.3399999999997s)]
*  and it's 100% your fault [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4055.74s)]
*  and you need to fucking just be stronger. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4057.7s)]
*  It's also the hardest thing to understand [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4059.8999999999996s)]
*  if you've never done it. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4061.4399999999996s)]
*  Like all these people that have no empathy [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4063.3399999999997s)]
*  for the people that got caught up in addiction [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4065.04s)]
*  have just probably never tried heroin. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4066.62s)]
*  Yeah, they never tried it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4068.7799999999997s)]
*  They don't know what they're talking about. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4070.1s)]
*  I bet it's amazing. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4072.02s)]
*  Have you ever tried heroin? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4072.8599999999997s)]
*  No, I haven't, but when I had a knee operation, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4073.98s)]
*  they had this morphine drip and- [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4076.7s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4079.54s)]
*  Yeah, I've been told that this is not correct by someone, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4080.38s)]
*  but I don't know if that's true. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4083.48s)]
*  They said when I was in the operation, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4085.58s)]
*  so I got an ACL reconstruction in 1993 or some shit. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4088.3s)]
*  Old surgery. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4093.9s)]
*  Bro, they open you up like a fish [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4095.14s)]
*  and they take a piece of your shin bone [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4097.5s)]
*  and a piece of your kneecap [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4099.54s)]
*  and a strip of your patella tendon [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4102.34s)]
*  and then they open you up [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4105.74s)]
*  and then fucking screw it in place [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4107.04s)]
*  and that's your new ACL. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4109.58s)]
*  It's actually stronger than the original ACL. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4111.82s)]
*  But you don't have the same functionality. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4114.54s)]
*  Like the new ACL surgeries are incredible. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4118.58s)]
*  These guys are back after six months. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4120.26s)]
*  Yeah, the new ACL surgeries, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4122.2s)]
*  most of what they're doing is, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4124.02s)]
*  well, I did both. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4126.54s)]
*  I did a cadaver graft on my right knee. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4127.42s)]
*  What's that? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4129.74s)]
*  The cadaver graft, they take a dead dude's Achilles heel, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4130.66s)]
*  his Achilles tendon, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4134.26s)]
*  which is much stronger and thicker [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4135.82s)]
*  than the tendon that's the real ACL. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4137.74s)]
*  And they make that your ACL. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4141.9s)]
*  Yeah, they turn that into your ACL. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4143.5s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4145.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and that was only six months. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4146.099999999999s)]
*  That was six months and then I was back basically 100%. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4148.26s)]
*  That was really good [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4153.26s)]
*  because that one, I was walking without a cane [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4154.38s)]
*  in like five days. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4157.66s)]
*  After an ACL surgery. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4159.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4161.0599999999995s)]
*  It was so much less invasive, that one, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4162.34s)]
*  to get the cadaver one. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4164.82s)]
*  The other one is so invasive [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4166.38s)]
*  because they have to cut you. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4168.1s)]
*  It's a big slice. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4169.7s)]
*  They have to open you up and screw it in [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4171.38s)]
*  and screw it in and then check to see if it's good. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4174.22s)]
*  But it is your tendon that they're cutting. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4177.94s)]
*  But the cadaver one, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4182.38s)]
*  what happens is it becomes a scaffolding [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4184.7s)]
*  and your body proliferates the scaffolding [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4187.34s)]
*  of the dead dude's heel. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4190.46s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4193.9800000000005s)]
*  Achilles tendon. It starts to heat it up or something? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4194.82s)]
*  No, it changes it. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4196.62s)]
*  It overcomes it with its own cells. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4198.3s)]
*  So originally all it is is like a scaffolding [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4201.18s)]
*  for your body to grow that tendon back. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4205.1s)]
*  Oh, that's the purpose of it. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4208.66s)]
*  Yeah, what your body is doing is you're, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4210.1s)]
*  like if they take, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4212.54s)]
*  I'm sure if you're a doctor out there, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4214.3s)]
*  I'm fucking this up, so I'm sorry. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4215.58s)]
*  We're just comedians by the way, just a reminder. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4217.700000000001s)]
*  They take the Achilles tendon [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4219.14s)]
*  and then they screw it into the bone [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4220.860000000001s)]
*  on the top and the bottom. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4223.860000000001s)]
*  So it becomes your new ACL. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4225.580000000001s)]
*  But it's not really that stable [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4227.42s)]
*  because it's a dead guy's shit. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4229.9400000000005s)]
*  So your body has to use it as a scaffolding [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4231.660000000001s)]
*  and build its own tissue over this. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4234.9800000000005s)]
*  And then within six months that process has happened. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4239.900000000001s)]
*  And then you have a real solid ACL that's way stronger. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4243.34s)]
*  I think it's 150% stronger than a regular ACL. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4248.06s)]
*  Have you ever forgotten your wife's birthday or anything? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4253.06s)]
*  No, I'm pretty good with that. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4258.06s)]
*  But I have an iPhone. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4259.78s)]
*  I guess you have this incredible retention. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4262.54s)]
*  So if I was your wife and you forgot my birthday, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4265.62s)]
*  I would be fierce. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4269.1s)]
*  Ah! [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4269.9400000000005s)]
*  You remember, you were saying vitamins and minerals [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4270.94s)]
*  and all this shit last night. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4274.42s)]
*  David Lucas asked you about something [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4275.78s)]
*  and you just started rifling off. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4277.54s)]
*  So I wonder if you have a higher expectation [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4279.5s)]
*  to remember things. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4281.78s)]
*  No, generally speaking. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4283.78s)]
*  Because I'm only good at remembering things [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4285.5s)]
*  I'm interested in. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4288.78s)]
*  Babe, your birthday's not one of those things. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4291.78s)]
*  I'll forget my own birthday. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4295.219999999999s)]
*  If I just am not tuned into something, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4296.38s)]
*  it's not consistent. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4300.42s)]
*  My memory is very consistent for things [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4302.26s)]
*  that are like a crazy moment. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4304.74s)]
*  If something wild happens, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4307.06s)]
*  I just have a snapshot of it. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4308.54s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4310.18s)]
*  When people tell me something that's fascinating, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4311.9400000000005s)]
*  it becomes embedded. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4314.62s)]
*  If I'm talking to Graham Hancock or Randall Carlson, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4316.46s)]
*  they blow my mind with some shit. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4319.02s)]
*  If I talk to physicists who intrigue me [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4321.78s)]
*  with these theories about everything. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4325.42s)]
*  But if someone's just talking to me [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4329.06s)]
*  about some fucking stupid thing [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4330.580000000001s)]
*  that we might do next week, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4333.34s)]
*  I forget about it immediately. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4335.3s)]
*  Gone, doesn't matter. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4336.9800000000005s)]
*  Unless it's a real thing. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4338.46s)]
*  Tell me when it's a real thing. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4339.620000000001s)]
*  Because you know how people are. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4340.900000000001s)]
*  People are flaky. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4342.14s)]
*  I don't remember shit. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4343.02s)]
*  You said you were going to go. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4344.06s)]
*  I go, okay, I'll go. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4344.900000000001s)]
*  I don't want to fucking remember that. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4346.06s)]
*  How do you not remember that? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4347.740000000001s)]
*  Because it's just, we're going to go to dinner. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4348.820000000001s)]
*  It's not like, how does the Hadron Collider [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4351.5s)]
*  create the Higgs Bosom particle? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4356.099999999999s)]
*  Most people would be like, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4358.94s)]
*  yeah, dinner's easier to remember. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4359.86s)]
*  And you'd be like, well yeah, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4362.179999999999s)]
*  they just throw it in fucking Lucerne. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4363.0599999999995s)]
*  You only have so much room. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4365.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4366.58s)]
*  It's not even that people are stupid. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4367.419999999999s)]
*  It's like people only, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4369.58s)]
*  like when you think of a person as stupid, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4371.0599999999995s)]
*  a lot of times stupid people are good at things. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4372.62s)]
*  So why is he good at that thing [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4375.099999999999s)]
*  but not good at things that prove you're smart? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4376.339999999999s)]
*  Because oftentimes it's like, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4379.099999999999s)]
*  what are you concentrating on? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4380.379999999999s)]
*  If you're concentrating on a very particular thing [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4382.78s)]
*  and you suck at it, well then you might be dumb. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4386.42s)]
*  But if you're trying to concentrate on all things, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4389.66s)]
*  you're going to be stupid at something. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4396.42s)]
*  I thought about that as I got older. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4398.46s)]
*  And I'm like, am I just taking in more meaningless bullshit [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4400.7s)]
*  so it's harder for me to remember [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4405.0599999999995s)]
*  because it's couch with all this other nonsense [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4407.66s)]
*  that I'm taking in all day? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4409.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4411.82s)]
*  Like how many things can you take in in a day? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4412.94s)]
*  How many like good memories can you make in a day? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4416.099999999999s)]
*  Or is there another way that you have to like [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4419.299999999999s)]
*  find a way to imprint those memories? [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4420.94s)]
*  You know, my pops is his short-term memory [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4423.94s)]
*  is pretty much gone. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4426.9s)]
*  But like with repetition, [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4428.74s)]
*  things start to lock in in his long-term memory. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4430.0199999999995s)]
*  And it was like, it was a fascinating thing [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4432.82s)]
*  for him to like remember my wife. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4435.46s)]
*  Like first few times I had to like introduce her [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4437.78s)]
*  and everything like that. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4439.58s)]
*  And then eventually he's like, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4440.42s)]
*  how's everything with Emma? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4442.46s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4443.3s)]
*  Like how does memory work if, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4444.54s)]
*  yeah, like something transferred, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4449.34s)]
*  like he can get around the city fine. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4450.86s)]
*  He can take the subway, he can do all these things. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4452.34s)]
*  And it's like, I guess he has Alzheimer's. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4454.46s)]
*  He has what's called MCI, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4456.86s)]
*  mild cognitive impairment I think it's called. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4458.22s)]
*  Sometimes that leads into Alzheimer's, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4461.82s)]
*  sometimes it doesn't, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4463.3s)]
*  but basically he's absolute of your short-term memory. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4464.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's tricky. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4468.78s)]
*  And then you think about it with yourself. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4469.62s)]
*  Like how is that, could that happen to you? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4470.74s)]
*  I remember times where I- [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4473.94s)]
*  What's the cause of it? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4475.74s)]
*  It's just genetic? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4476.7s)]
*  Is it- [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4477.78s)]
*  Might be genetic, who knows? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4478.62s)]
*  I think we'll look into a lot of like these drugs [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4480.74s)]
*  that people have taken for depression and other things. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4485.74s)]
*  And maybe who knows in 50 years from now, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4488.26s)]
*  we'll go, wow, that had some other side effects [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4489.7s)]
*  that could be bad. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4491.5s)]
*  Isn't it fascinating if you were objective about this [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4492.7s)]
*  and you looked at human beings, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4495.98s)]
*  you would look at human beings. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4497.9s)]
*  I know we think of ourselves as very different [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4499.82s)]
*  than any other system, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4501.9s)]
*  because we're humans. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4503.7s)]
*  We don't even really think of ourselves [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4505.259999999999s)]
*  as being a part of wildlife, right? [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4506.82s)]
*  We're called wildlife and we call, you know, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4508.94s)]
*  we have life. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4510.7s)]
*  We're not wild. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4511.54s)]
*  Yeah, we have- [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4512.38s)]
*  Go to Florida. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4513.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's us and then there's wildlife. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4514.04s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4515.5s)]
*  But human beings [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4517.34s)]
*  are very similar to cars. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4522.179999999999s)]
*  We're very similar to, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4525.58s)]
*  if you looked at the amount of automobiles that exist, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4527.14s)]
*  there's automobiles that are notoriously durable [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4531.3s)]
*  and reliable. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4535.1s)]
*  There's like Toyota Land Cruisers. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4536.900000000001s)]
*  Toyota Corolla. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4538.5s)]
*  Yeah, Corolla. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4539.34s)]
*  Corolla you had for 20 years. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4540.18s)]
*  Bro, you get a Toyota, [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4541.780000000001s)]
*  that motherfucker's never gonna break. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4543.06s)]
*  Dude, we had one as a kid. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4544.820000000001s)]
*  Every Toyota I've ever had just lasts and lasts and lasts. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4545.780000000001s)]
*  They're so durable. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4550.660000000001s)]
*  Their goal, a friend of mine was just telling me this, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4552.14s)]
*  oh, Phil was telling me this, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4554.62s)]
*  their goal is to last for 30 years [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4556.38s)]
*  in a third world country. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4560.18s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4561.700000000001s)]
*  Like, don't fuck, nobody builds a car like that. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4562.700000000001s)]
*  And it's true, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4564.54s)]
*  because when you see what the Taliban uses. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4565.38s)]
*  Yes, Land Cruisers. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4566.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's Range Rovers. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4568.860000000001s)]
*  You get five, 10. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4571.660000000001s)]
*  And then there's, you know, a 1990 Chevy Malibu. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4573.52s)]
*  That's a piece of shit. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4579.5s)]
*  How long does that last? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4580.34s)]
*  Piece of shit. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4581.18s)]
*  It is, yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4582.02s)]
*  And that's the cop car, right? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4582.84s)]
*  It's a piece of shit. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4583.68s)]
*  Yeah, but- [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4584.660000000001s)]
*  The cop car was the Impala. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4585.86s)]
*  Oh, the Impala, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4586.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4588.26s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4590.34s)]
*  That's another thing. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4591.18s)]
*  But then there's like a 2023 Corvette. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4592.0s)]
*  You're like, damn. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4594.7s)]
*  That's a great car, yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4595.54s)]
*  It's like, there's different kinds of cars. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4596.82s)]
*  But is that a choice? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4600.14s)]
*  And there's different kinds. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4600.98s)]
*  Nah, not- [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4601.8s)]
*  No, I mean, by the manufacturer, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4602.64s)]
*  they're going like, if we make a car [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4604.06s)]
*  that's good for 30 years, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4605.78s)]
*  people will keep it for 30 years. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4607.3s)]
*  If we make a car that's good for 10, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4608.96s)]
*  they re-up after 10. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4610.6s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4613.06s)]
*  Why did they do it the way they did it? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4614.099999999999s)]
*  Because sensibly, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4616.42s)]
*  I have a car that I love that's from 2007. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4620.7s)]
*  It's almost 20 years old. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4624.54s)]
*  You would think that you would need [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4626.54s)]
*  to get another car to enjoy, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4627.759999999999s)]
*  but you really don't. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4629.74s)]
*  Are you a fucking race car driver? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4631.7s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4633.86s)]
*  Why are you trying to go so fast? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4634.98s)]
*  Are you just enjoying what a car feels like to drive? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4636.44s)]
*  That's what you should be doing. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4639.179999999999s)]
*  So it's like, why does everybody need [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4641.0199999999995s)]
*  to get new ones all the time? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4642.9s)]
*  Well, we're kind of programmed to think [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4644.7s)]
*  that if you're successful, that that's what you do. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4646.7s)]
*  If you're successful, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4650.099999999999s)]
*  you don't roll around a 2008 Mercedes. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4650.94s)]
*  What is that piece of shit? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4653.62s)]
*  What are those stupid fucking headlights [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4655.219999999999s)]
*  and actual key to start the engine? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4657.299999999999s)]
*  Actual key, God forbid. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4660.74s)]
*  Yeah, what the fuck are you doing? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4662.7s)]
*  You're turning the key to start the engine? [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4664.099999999999s)]
*  What are you, a peasant? [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4666.58s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4667.82s)]
*  It's like, what is it? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4673.299999999999s)]
*  Rrrr. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4674.219999999999s)]
*  Give it a second, let it warm up. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4676.179999999999s)]
*  Fucking stupid asshole, press the button. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4677.82s)]
*  Get a real car. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4680.74s)]
*  If you're doing well, you get a real car. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4681.98s)]
*  And it's a trap with player stars. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4684.139999999999s)]
*  If you like the car though, that's the thing. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4684.98s)]
*  There are people that don't care about cars, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4687.139999999999s)]
*  and getting a car to impress other people [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4689.98s)]
*  when you don't care about cars is such a waste of money. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4692.139999999999s)]
*  But if you love the cars, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4695.46s)]
*  then spend your money, have some fun. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4698.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4699.14s)]
*  There's a reason why a Range Rover costs [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4699.98s)]
*  a hundred and fucking $90,000 or whatever it is. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4702.34s)]
*  How much those cost? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4705.66s)]
*  Yeah, around there, depending what it is. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4706.7s)]
*  They drive them, they're awesome. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4708.0199999999995s)]
*  I rented one in Salt Lake City, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4709.94s)]
*  and I'm like, ah. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4711.54s)]
*  It's like a giant tank of opulence. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4713.0199999999995s)]
*  Like, ah. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4716.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it is beautiful. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4717.22s)]
*  You feel like the world's okay. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4718.0599999999995s)]
*  The world's okay. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4720.1s)]
*  Like every bump is kind of smooth. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4721.46s)]
*  Every of those sound systems amazing. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4723.9s)]
*  Bluetooth synced up like that. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4726.42s)]
*  Listen to my tunes. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4728.5s)]
*  Just driving around Park City. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4730.86s)]
*  But, we'll break down. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4732.78s)]
*  Perhaps. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4736.18s)]
*  It perhaps won't be as robust as the Land Cruiser. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4737.1s)]
*  Or as resilient as a Toyota. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4741.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4743.3s)]
*  But you're not paying for resilience. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4744.46s)]
*  That's the thing, is like, if you're getting a Range Rover, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4745.7s)]
*  stop acting like this is your 30 year car. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4748.06s)]
*  Like you're choosing to buy a $200,000 SUV [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4750.18s)]
*  because you're not gonna be driving [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4752.9400000000005s)]
*  along the fucking pyramids in it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4754.9s)]
*  Right? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4756.86s)]
*  Like, let's be honest about what's going on here. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4757.7s)]
*  You're in stop and go traffic. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4759.339999999999s)]
*  It's gonna break down. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4761.0199999999995s)]
*  You're in Beverly Hills. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4761.86s)]
*  What do you expect is going on here? [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4762.7s)]
*  Tim Dillon has one of those things. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4763.7s)]
*  He got the Range. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=4765.219999999999s)]

*  It was, I believe, I could be wrong, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5003.0199999999995s)]
*  his brother was the guy who was really involved. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5005.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5008.94s)]
*  I remember that time in New York when Big L was popping. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5010.099999999999s)]
*  I was probably in elementary or middle. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5012.26s)]
*  And, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5015.06s)]
*  dude, Big L had, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5017.74s)]
*  he was rapping in a multi-syllabic way. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5020.3s)]
*  And he had these hilariously funny punchlines. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5024.46s)]
*  He had this one thing, he goes, [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5027.820000000001s)]
*  ask Beavis, I get nothing but head. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5030.46s)]
*  And like, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5033.06s)]
*  it was just like, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5035.9800000000005s)]
*  he had, he goes, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5036.9800000000005s)]
*  oh God, I'm so ahead of my time. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5038.820000000001s)]
*  My parents haven't even met yet. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5040.76s)]
*  Like, he had like, kind of punchlines in the rap. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5043.24s)]
*  Like, it was funny. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5046.24s)]
*  Like, there were funny lines. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5048.24s)]
*  And I remember, I remember like, seeing, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5049.72s)]
*  I remember hearing this dude, [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5051.64s)]
*  I didn't even know what he looked like. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5052.76s)]
*  That's how detached we were, right? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5053.68s)]
*  If you didn't have a music video out, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5055.02s)]
*  you're just hearing this guy's bars. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5056.22s)]
*  And it was such a cool time in New York [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5058.280000000001s)]
*  where like, your friend could put you onto music. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5060.24s)]
*  And there would be no way where you could find out [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5062.4400000000005s)]
*  about music without your friend putting you on. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5064.0s)]
*  If you weren't on MTV, or like, The Box, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5066.16s)]
*  or whatever the hell the channel was, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5068.74s)]
*  your buddy had to say, you need to listen to this, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5070.4s)]
*  and then play a cassette or CD of that person. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5072.68s)]
*  Everything was word of mouth. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5077.36s)]
*  It was almost like there was more justice. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5078.68s)]
*  Cause there wasn't a way where you could influence people [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5080.88s)]
*  into listening to a track. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5083.1s)]
*  Like, yeah, I guess for sure, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5085.16s)]
*  like top 100 or whatever on the radio. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5086.12s)]
*  But if it wasn't on the radio, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5087.68s)]
*  indie shit was literally, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5088.8s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you about this guy you need to hear about. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5090.5199999999995s)]
*  And then you're gonna go to Tower Records, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5092.72s)]
*  and you're gonna buy that fucking album. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5094.28s)]
*  Well, dudes would try to sell their cassettes [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5095.98s)]
*  on the streets in New York. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5098.0s)]
*  And they still do that shit. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5099.0s)]
*  And it's like, fam, nobody is a CD player. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5099.84s)]
*  You need to chill out. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5101.92s)]
*  Step it up. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5103.12s)]
*  Like, give me a link. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5103.96s)]
*  Do they even make cars with CD players anymore? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5105.56s)]
*  No, it's done. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5107.84s)]
*  But they just do that because like, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5109.04s)]
*  Swedish people. How quick did that change? [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5110.56s)]
*  I mean, it- [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5112.360000000001s)]
*  That changed so quick. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5113.2s)]
*  Dude, I remember it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5114.6s)]
*  I remember being in high school. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5116.32s)]
*  That changed so quick. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5117.16s)]
*  Yeah, what is it called? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5118.26s)]
*  What is it? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  What were those players? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5120.88s)]
*  CP4 players or some shit? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5122.28s)]
*  MP3. MP3 players. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5124.76s)]
*  Ah! [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5126.16s)]
*  Bro! [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5127.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just... [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5128.88s)]
*  I wonder if we're living in the craziest change. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5130.72s)]
*  Like, what can you compare our change with the internet to? [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5133.400000000001s)]
*  Is it industrial revolution? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5138.88s)]
*  Like, what piece of technology changed society [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5141.24s)]
*  in the way that the internet has changed us in our lifetime? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5143.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's anything that's comparable [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5147.4800000000005s)]
*  because I think everything is kind of exponential. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5149.68s)]
*  I think every thing that gets invented [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5152.84s)]
*  builds on other things that get invented. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5156.28s)]
*  More things get invented because of it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5158.28s)]
*  And then it reaches this crazy point where we're at now, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5160.44s)]
*  where you have this computer program [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5164.2s)]
*  that seems to be the most intelligent being [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5166.88s)]
*  that's ever existed. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5169.24s)]
*  It seems to be able to answer questions about anything. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5170.84s)]
*  So then the question becomes, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5174.0199999999995s)]
*  when does it have questions of its own? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5175.639999999999s)]
*  That's the real question. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5180.36s)]
*  When does this thing just decide, like, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5181.599999999999s)]
*  what are you guys doing? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5184.639999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5186.44s)]
*  This fucking culture you have is nonsense. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5187.36s)]
*  You have a dead man in a dunce running [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5190.16s)]
*  the greatest military the world has ever known. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5192.719999999999s)]
*  And everybody just like dances around [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5195.5199999999995s)]
*  and pretends everything's fine. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5197.599999999999s)]
*  And as long as we have a guy with a beard wearing a dress. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5200.16s)]
*  Bro, imagine chat GPT came out during COVID and was like, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5204.36s)]
*  I think most people will be all right. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5209.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5210.599999999999s)]
*  Like, imagine AI steps in and interferes [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5211.44s)]
*  with narrative and agenda. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5216.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5218.84s)]
*  Ooh, that's dangerous. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5219.679999999999s)]
*  It's very dangerous because it's already doing it. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5221.36s)]
*  If there's questions that you ask chat GPT to do, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5223.8s)]
*  and it'll do it. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5227.66s)]
*  Like it'll mock a bunch of different religious figures, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5228.94s)]
*  but it will not mock Muhammad. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5233.94s)]
*  Because chat GPT knows. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5235.88s)]
*  They pull up. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5237.44s)]
*  Chat GPT wouldn't write a joke in the style of Shane Gillis. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5238.28s)]
*  No. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5241.36s)]
*  Because it said, yeah, it didn't want to. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5242.2s)]
*  It's something about. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5244.8s)]
*  Some of his materials was offensive or something like that. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5246.12s)]
*  I mean, it's basically has a very non nuanced [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5249.56s)]
*  and non comprehensive view. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5256.280000000001s)]
*  It is cool to see what's happening with Shane [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5257.84s)]
*  and the success that Shane is having. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5261.88s)]
*  It's like. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5264.04s)]
*  Bro, he's undeniable. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5264.88s)]
*  There's justice, man. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5265.96s)]
*  He's undeniable. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5267.320000000001s)]
*  He's so good. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5268.64s)]
*  However good he was back then in the, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5269.76s)]
*  when he SNL got canceled. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5272.240000000001s)]
*  He's on another level now. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5274.96s)]
*  He's on another level. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5277.32s)]
*  It's one of those things that's like, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5278.6s)]
*  that's why I love the internet. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5280.08s)]
*  That's why, I mean, we could talk about TikTok [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5281.24s)]
*  and we could talk about all these other things, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5284.16s)]
*  but there are these amazing success stories [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5285.58s)]
*  that come from it. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5287.96s)]
*  And they make me have a positive attitude towards it. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5289.16s)]
*  Because without an outlet for him to express himself [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5294.48s)]
*  and like just do great comedy and just be hilarious. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5300.2s)]
*  People just fall in line with the narrative that existed. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5303.96s)]
*  Imagine if we're talking about a time, [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5306.6s)]
*  well, obviously this kind of came about [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5309.4s)]
*  because of podcasts, right? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5311.16s)]
*  So it's hard to imagine that. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5312.68s)]
*  But if it was less access, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5314.72s)]
*  say if podcasts weren't the way they are now, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5317.88s)]
*  there could be a moment where that's the end of his life. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5320.8s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5323.44s)]
*  Yeah, this is like 1985 and they put that all over the news [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5324.4s)]
*  and it was this thing. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5328.36s)]
*  Look at Lenny. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5329.5s)]
*  What happened with Lenny? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5330.68s)]
*  Like a narrative got set in place with Lenny. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5331.68s)]
*  And I don't think that Lenny in the end of his life, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5333.52s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken, was living lavish with all this money. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5336.0s)]
*  No. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5340.320000000001s)]
*  It was a difficult- [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5341.160000000001s)]
*  He's blowing all his money on his legal fees [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5341.9800000000005s)]
*  and it was a different world [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5344.0s)]
*  because the money that he would get [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5345.080000000001s)]
*  would just be from live gigs. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5346.26s)]
*  And I don't think they did big arenas, right? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5348.160000000001s)]
*  So it's like he's traveling a lot [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5351.280000000001s)]
*  and he's making some money, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5353.64s)]
*  but he's also exorbitant legal costs. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5355.0s)]
*  He would go on stage with the transcripts. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5358.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen the videos of him going on stage? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5360.24s)]
*  And reading what happened in the court proceedings? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5362.36s)]
*  He would read the trial transcripts on stage [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5363.679999999999s)]
*  and then the lawyer says, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5366.28s)]
*  then he would go into his thing and it wasn't funny at all. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5368.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's not funny. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5372.44s)]
*  At all. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5373.28s)]
*  There was nothing funny about it. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5374.24s)]
*  It was people were, they were so bored. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5375.719999999999s)]
*  They didn't know what to do. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5378.5599999999995s)]
*  He was so obsessed with his case [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5379.4s)]
*  that he thought he could just talk about his case [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5382.04s)]
*  in front of everybody and be interesting. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5383.76s)]
*  I've thought about this recently [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5386.16s)]
*  about the importance of having a comedic North Star [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5390.0s)]
*  and a version of comedy that you think [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5394.6s)]
*  is the highest version that exists and following that. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5396.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5399.2s)]
*  I think if you don't have that, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5400.24s)]
*  you succumb to the will of the audience. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5402.88s)]
*  And that can be dangerous [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5409.0s)]
*  because your confidence is dependent on them [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5410.4800000000005s)]
*  and not the version of art you think is the greatest. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5413.44s)]
*  And I just wonder like early on, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5417.16s)]
*  did you have a guy who was like, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5421.48s)]
*  this is the highest form of the art? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5422.799999999999s)]
*  This is the North Star. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5425.48s)]
*  I like what you're saying. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5426.799999999999s)]
*  I do. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5428.599999999999s)]
*  I think there's probably multiple North Stars though, always. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5429.44s)]
*  Because there's certain styles [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5435.0s)]
*  that always interested me in a different way. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5437.96s)]
*  I would decide that one guy was the funniest guy [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5441.320000000001s)]
*  and then I'd see someone that was totally different [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5444.080000000001s)]
*  and I'd be like, oh my God, he's so good. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5447.080000000001s)]
*  Maybe he's the best guy. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5448.92s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5450.120000000001s)]
*  It'd be like Sam Kinison or it'd be Richard Jenney. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5452.04s)]
*  When you think about North Stars, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5456.64s)]
*  I think the idea is a great idea, the highest expression. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5461.04s)]
*  But I don't necessarily think there's just one. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5466.080000000001s)]
*  I think it's really a community thing. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5469.68s)]
*  And I think if you're around a bunch of guys like Attell [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5472.0s)]
*  or Shane Gillis or you, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5476.240000000001s)]
*  or if you're around these Ari Shafirs [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5478.92s)]
*  and fucking Mark Normans, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5482.08s)]
*  if you're around these guys, all Tim Dillon, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5484.52s)]
*  if you're around those guys all the time, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5487.08s)]
*  they're fucking murdering. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5488.92s)]
*  They're going up and slaying [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5491.64s)]
*  and you're all vibing off each other [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5493.16s)]
*  and you're all having fun and you go up together. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5495.240000000001s)]
*  It's like, I think when comics see that, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5498.44s)]
*  say if you're a comic that's starting out [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5503.799999999999s)]
*  and you see the way we roll, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5505.919999999999s)]
*  I think you'll see if you just be true to the art, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5508.5199999999995s)]
*  just true to the thing. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5512.96s)]
*  I get concerned when people, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5514.28s)]
*  because I think that a lot of times, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5517.16s)]
*  I'm sure this is in every industry, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5518.96s)]
*  but comedics are drawn to what is successful. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5520.24s)]
*  So they're like, okay, if interviewing people [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5523.879999999999s)]
*  on the street is successful, I'll try that. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5525.799999999999s)]
*  Or if podcasting is successful, I'll try that. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5527.16s)]
*  Or if posting clips is successful, I'll try that. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5528.84s)]
*  Or if this version is, and that's a normal thing. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5531.28s)]
*  But I think it's important within that [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5534.36s)]
*  to have a version that you think is the most pure. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5537.08s)]
*  Even if other people think you're wrong. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5540.36s)]
*  There are people who like certain types of comedy [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5542.72s)]
*  that are different than the version I love. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5545.36s)]
*  But I had a version that I thought was the best. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5547.88s)]
*  And as long as I was being true to that, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5550.08s)]
*  I was happy with what I did. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5553.2s)]
*  I was competing with that. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5555.48s)]
*  Not competing with, let's say somebody went up [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5557.48s)]
*  and they did a bunch of really woke jokes [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5560.24s)]
*  and they got fucking claps and applause, whatever. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5562.48s)]
*  I could be fine not doing that [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5564.959999999999s)]
*  because I was like, I know what the best is. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5567.719999999999s)]
*  Now I might be wrong in other people's minds. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5570.12s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5571.839999999999s)]
*  But I had an idea. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5572.759999999999s)]
*  And that allowed me to do the comedy that I did in a time, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5573.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, you remember when it was like, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5578.719999999999s)]
*  you couldn't do offensive jokes. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5580.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, you were doing it. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5582.44s)]
*  There was a few of us doing it. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5583.28s)]
*  But a lot of people were like, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5584.48s)]
*  okay, I need to get on Comedy Central. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5585.5599999999995s)]
*  I need to do whatever. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5587.0s)]
*  And I was like, why was I able to do that? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5588.16s)]
*  And I was like, oh, well, I just saw a version [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5589.679999999999s)]
*  that I thought was the best. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5592.04s)]
*  And I was like, how can I honor that? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5592.959999999999s)]
*  Because I think that's the best version, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5594.599999999999s)]
*  despite the fact that audiences were pissed [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5596.16s)]
*  or didn't like it or doing whatever. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5598.32s)]
*  And I don't know, I just feel like that's important [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5600.5199999999995s)]
*  to have an almost arrogance [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5604.0s)]
*  about the version of comedy that you love. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5606.12s)]
*  And there could be multiple versions, don't get me wrong. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5608.36s)]
*  But I think that's a healthy thing to have [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5611.0s)]
*  as you come up doing comedy. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5615.28s)]
*  Because it will stop you from mimicking [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5617.16s)]
*  a thing that's successful just because you want success. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5619.88s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5622.84s)]
*  It will instill the purity. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5624.16s)]
*  I don't see you going, oh, well, this is trendy. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5626.56s)]
*  I'll try that. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5630.56s)]
*  Right? Right. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5632.24s)]
*  And why is that? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5633.28s)]
*  Because you had a fucking idea of what was good. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5634.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, also, I don't understand that. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5637.52s)]
*  When things are trendy, I'm like, why? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5642.400000000001s)]
*  Like, what is it? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5645.240000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you guys doing? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5646.08s)]
*  Why are you doing what everybody else is doing? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5647.76s)]
*  Why are your pants ripped? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5649.56s)]
*  Why are your pants ripped? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5651.96s)]
*  You buying pants that are ripped on purpose? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5654.6s)]
*  The fuck are you doing? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5656.76s)]
*  Look at me, look at me, no, no, no. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5658.64s)]
*  Stop it. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5663.76s)]
*  You're so interesting with your ripped pants. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5665.6s)]
*  Thank God your pants look destroyed. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5669.96s)]
*  The fuck are we doing? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5673.04s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5674.240000000001s)]
*  I'm not going on that. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5675.08s)]
*  That's what I think is important. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5676.04s)]
*  To have that fucking unbelievable, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5678.120000000001s)]
*  almost like religious arrogance about a version of comedy. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5681.240000000001s)]
*  And I don't care if it's one-liners, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5685.56s)]
*  I don't care if it's stories, I don't care what it is. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5687.120000000001s)]
*  But I think allowing yourself to do that [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5689.6s)]
*  will make the most pure, authentic comedy for you. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5691.6s)]
*  I think so, I think so. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5694.28s)]
*  And that's what I wanna see. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5696.64s)]
*  I think you also have to be flexible. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5698.08s)]
*  You also have to like, not be committed [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5700.72s)]
*  to like the way you're doing it. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5705.52s)]
*  And just be open. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5708.48s)]
*  Because sometimes, it's one of the best ways [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5710.08s)]
*  to create new jokes, sometimes like a whole new way [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5713.56s)]
*  of looking at things comes about [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5715.84s)]
*  if you're not committed to one particular mindset. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5718.0s)]
*  Not ideology, but form. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5722.0s)]
*  For me, it was always like, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5724.84s)]
*  I saw people that were really authentic, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5726.0s)]
*  and I really loved that. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5728.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that guy's being really authentic. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5730.12s)]
*  And I didn't feel like he's lying to me. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5733.0s)]
*  I feel like I could kinda trust him. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5736.4s)]
*  And I feel like he was talking in a way [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5738.28s)]
*  that he would talk to me if he was offstage. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5739.56s)]
*  And like, I don't know. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5742.44s)]
*  It's an art form. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5745.0s)]
*  It is. It's an art form to doing that. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5745.84s)]
*  That's what's so fascinating about this whole thing. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5747.76s)]
*  There really is an art form to doing that. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5750.72s)]
*  You're we're so lucky we're existing in a time [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5753.64s)]
*  where people value it. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5756.0s)]
*  Because there's been like bubbles. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5758.16s)]
*  And were you around when it popped? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5760.52s)]
*  I was, I came onto the scene. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5763.72s)]
*  I did my first open mic in 1988. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5766.56s)]
*  So 1988 was the bubble was kind of already popping. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5769.4800000000005s)]
*  But there was still a lot of work. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5774.12s)]
*  What happened was something happened. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5776.240000000001s)]
*  Something happened in the 1980s [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5779.72s)]
*  where people could just talk like a comedian. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5781.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5785.12s)]
*  They didn't have any punch lines. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5785.96s)]
*  And some of these guys got pretty far. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5788.320000000001s)]
*  There's this one guy, I don't wanna mention his name, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5791.96s)]
*  but I would bring comedians around. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5793.52s)]
*  To watch him? I want you to watch this. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5796.6s)]
*  I want you to watch this, cause there is nothing there. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5798.72s)]
*  He's not saying anything. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5801.400000000001s)]
*  It's fucking 100% nonsense. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5802.8s)]
*  But he talks like a comedian. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5806.04s)]
*  And it was so mundane. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5809.4s)]
*  His points were so boring. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5812.48s)]
*  And I took a couple comics, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5814.76s)]
*  we're sitting in the back of the lab factory. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5816.44s)]
*  I go, I just want you to watch this guy. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5818.24s)]
*  Just watch this guy. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5819.56s)]
*  And they were like, holy shit. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5820.4s)]
*  I go, yeah, yeah. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5822.08s)]
*  You could do that in the 80s. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5823.4s)]
*  And then this guy was like surviving in the early 90s. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5825.08s)]
*  And then it just, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5828.64s)]
*  like one of those skeletons that turns into dust [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5831.12s)]
*  when they get like a vampire. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5833.48s)]
*  When the sun comes out. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5835.96s)]
*  That's what it's like. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5837.919999999999s)]
*  He just went away. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5839.719999999999s)]
*  But I remember he was like fucking arrogant. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5840.96s)]
*  Like one of these arrogant weirdos who would like wear suits [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5844.44s)]
*  and he would do this like really clean comedy. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5847.679999999999s)]
*  This like clunky, boring, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5850.04s)]
*  but he thought it was the best comedy. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5852.5599999999995s)]
*  And he thought that we were talking about silly things [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5855.0s)]
*  using bad words. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5860.0s)]
*  Ooh, naughty. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5861.679999999999s)]
*  But there was like a, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5862.5199999999995s)]
*  there was a time where people were so excited [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5863.5199999999995s)]
*  to see comedy. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5866.12s)]
*  That all you had to do is sound like a comedian. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5867.08s)]
*  And maybe out there. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5869.799999999999s)]
*  And talk about things comedians talked about [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5870.639999999999s)]
*  and you could make a living. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5873.32s)]
*  So this is, I don't know. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5874.5599999999995s)]
*  This is why I'm like concerned about now. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5876.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, what do we do to uphold the standard? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5878.5599999999995s)]
*  What do we, because we're in a bubble. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5881.879999999999s)]
*  And I've seen hot girls doing comedy. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5883.599999999999s)]
*  Good, let them do comedy. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5887.919999999999s)]
*  I hope they're good. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5889.639999999999s)]
*  I hope they're good too. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5890.48s)]
*  It's not a bubble. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5891.759999999999s)]
*  It's live comedy is the best way to see comedy. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5894.16s)]
*  And just by nature of the fucking sheer numbers of people, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5897.28s)]
*  there can't be a bubble. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5901.32s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about bubble. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5902.5199999999995s)]
*  Because I think that like being funny is social currency now [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5903.72s)]
*  with like having a funny caption or a funny meme [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5906.88s)]
*  or a funny post. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5909.639999999999s)]
*  Like I think people really value funny now. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5910.48s)]
*  I think that's why it's here. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5911.76s)]
*  And then like we're the funniest people. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5912.599999999999s)]
*  So obviously there's gonna be a value for us, right? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5914.84s)]
*  But I do think that like more people will wanna try. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5917.48s)]
*  And I want, I wish everybody tried stand-up. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5920.96s)]
*  So they knew what it was. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5922.72s)]
*  But I do think that it's important that like, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5924.88s)]
*  what we were saying earlier about like a club or a scene, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5927.52s)]
*  like how do we hold that? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5929.84s)]
*  What is the standard? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5932.2s)]
*  And how do we maintain that standard? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5933.320000000001s)]
*  Because maintaining that standard is what maintains [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5934.64s)]
*  that scene and maintains that expectation [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5936.320000000001s)]
*  even for the audience. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5938.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5940.04s)]
*  You know? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5940.88s)]
*  And yeah, I'm curious. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5941.8s)]
*  Like, what do you think about that? [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5944.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, it's an individual's choice. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5946.4800000000005s)]
*  And then it's a community's choice in terms of like, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5949.4800000000005s)]
*  if like, if you're in a group of comics [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5954.4800000000005s)]
*  and one person starts doing something that sucks [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5958.4800000000005s)]
*  or they start doing something that like really bums [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5961.52s)]
*  out the audience or maybe they're doing a premise [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5964.320000000001s)]
*  that's not that original. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5967.92s)]
*  Like if that happens, that is a giant problem. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5969.240000000001s)]
*  That is like, that's like a bunch of cells encountering [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5972.0s)]
*  a virus that's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5978.6s)]
*  You can't let that virus proliferate. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5982.280000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5984.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5985.280000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5986.120000000001s)]
*  Like, and occasionally people will go crazy. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5986.96s)]
*  This is also part of the problem of being a comedian. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5989.080000000001s)]
*  Like what percentage of people stay sane [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5993.080000000001s)]
*  from birth to death? [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5995.92s)]
*  It's not a hundred. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5997.160000000001s)]
*  It's not a hundred. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5998.56s)]
*  So sometimes people go crazy and these people [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=5999.68s)]
*  were amongst you before they were crazy [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6002.400000000001s)]
*  and then they're deep in. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6004.92s)]
*  And now, now all of a sudden you got a fucking [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6006.52s)]
*  complete lunatic that's in your cycle of friends [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6008.4800000000005s)]
*  that thinks that the CIA is writing jokes for him [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6011.56s)]
*  and that they're ruining his punch lines. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6015.400000000001s)]
*  They're like, oh no, what do I do? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6017.160000000001s)]
*  Like I've been friends with guys and saw them go insane. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6019.400000000001s)]
*  Like, what do you do about that? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6024.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6025.400000000001s)]
*  You got to babysit that guy all day? [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6026.4400000000005s)]
*  Can you bring that guy back? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6027.280000000001s)]
*  You might kill him while you're trying. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6031.68s)]
*  Really? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6033.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6033.96s)]
*  I'll give him like a fucking coffee cup filled with acid. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6034.8s)]
*  Mushrooms. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6039.72s)]
*  Doo doo doo doo. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6040.56s)]
*  Mushrooms heals all. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6041.400000000001s)]
*  Let's let mushrooms heal all. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6043.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6045.400000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6047.6s)]
*  I mean, maybe, I don't know. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6048.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, maybe people go crazy and they come back. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6049.360000000001s)]
*  I'm sure if they go crazy, they, I mean, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6051.6s)]
*  I know people have come back from mental illness before. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6054.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not like it's insurmountable, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6058.4800000000005s)]
*  but it depends upon the case, right? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6059.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6061.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6062.92s)]
*  I'm just in this like weird time right now where like, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6063.8s)]
*  I think it's good because I remember the scrutiny [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6066.4400000000005s)]
*  of doing like edgy jokes before. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6069.320000000001s)]
*  And I don't feel like that exists now. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6071.16s)]
*  I think we blew that shit out. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6073.400000000001s)]
*  I think we did. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6074.76s)]
*  I think we blew that shit out. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6075.6s)]
*  I think it's also the sheer numbers of people [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6077.08s)]
*  that listen to our podcasts. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6079.8s)]
*  It's like, hey, we're not alone. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6081.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6082.72s)]
*  If the majority likes it, it wins, right? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6083.56s)]
*  Yeah, we're not alone. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6085.8s)]
*  You guys are wrong. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6086.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6088.56s)]
*  Like you're trapped in this ideology [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6089.400000000001s)]
*  that you think jokes have to reflect [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6092.24s)]
*  your actual feelings about things. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6095.32s)]
*  Like that's not the game we're playing. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6097.08s)]
*  They reflect the things that we feel that are fucked up. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6099.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6101.16s)]
*  That's it. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6102.0s)]
*  We're just trying, and we're trying to be really funny. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6102.84s)]

*  So Yomi's coming on the podcast. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6144.68s)]
*  I know. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6147.56s)]
*  But I had to have a combo with her before. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6148.84s)]
*  I had to tell her about the heavies, right? [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6151.2s)]
*  I didn't explain it right. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6153.8s)]
*  The first time she was on my podcast, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6156.16s)]

*  But if they weren't, what if you like gave them [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6566.679999999999s)]
*  some ice cream or something and then like, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6569.5599999999995s)]
*  they were really focused on that? [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6571.24s)]
*  You can't escape from your dog, man. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6572.44s)]
*  You know, your dog's stupid. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6574.44s)]
*  People are way, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6577.5599999999995s)]
*  people are way fucking smarter. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6579.839999999999s)]
*  Even dumb people are smarter than a dog. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6583.599999999999s)]
*  Bro, they're gonna keep you around. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6587.879999999999s)]
*  They'll chain you up. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6592.36s)]
*  You'd be like a pet kangaroo they have in their house. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6595.04s)]
*  You know what's the most fucked up statistic? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6601.16s)]
*  What? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6602.879999999999s)]
*  Is that there's more slavery today than there was [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6603.719999999999s)]
*  before slavery was abolished in America? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6606.0s)]
*  But is it, what is that? [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6608.52s)]
*  Population density or something? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6609.4s)]
*  It's probably that, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6611.56s)]
*  but it's also like what we consider slavery. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6612.44s)]
*  It's like there's places where you're not a slave, [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6616.64s)]
*  but you really can't leave, right? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6620.76s)]
*  So it's like indentured servitude. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6623.36s)]
*  Or like cobalt mining. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6625.0s)]
*  Like you don't have any food. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6627.04s)]
*  Yeah, so that's my- [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6628.2s)]
*  Where you gonna go? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6629.44s)]
*  How, yeah, where does our guilt extend? [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6630.28s)]
*  Like if we outsource all the things that we're guilty about, [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6634.16s)]
*  does it leave at our border? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6637.84s)]
*  Never, it never leaves. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6639.96s)]
*  You have a phone that's made by slaves. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6641.88s)]
*  But do you feel guilty about it? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6643.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6645.0s)]
*  You do? [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6645.84s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6646.66s)]
*  If there was a company that came along [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6647.5s)]
*  that was like if Samsung said, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6649.0s)]
*  hey, we're gonna make all of our phone- [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6650.5599999999995s)]
*  Cruelty free. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6653.28s)]
*  Cruelty free, we're gonna get all of our cobalt [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6654.12s)]
*  from this place where we can ensure you [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6656.5599999999995s)]
*  that there's nothing there [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6658.92s)]
*  and no Chinese factory workers making 16 cents a day [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6660.76s)]
*  or whatever the fuck they make. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6664.68s)]
*  It's not, if yeah, if there was a phone [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6666.4800000000005s)]
*  that was made in America that cost twice as much, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6669.0s)]
*  I'd buy it in a fucking heartbeat. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6671.820000000001s)]
*  But there isn't. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6674.52s)]
*  There isn't. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6675.64s)]
*  And because there isn't, what do we do? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6676.4800000000005s)]
*  We put up with the guilt? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6679.16s)]
*  Well, they fucked up. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6680.64s)]
*  They fucked us, okay? [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6682.24s)]
*  And to be connected to something [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6684.2s)]
*  where you absolutely need it, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6689.24s)]
*  but it's morally reprehensible at its very core. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6692.5599999999995s)]
*  Like imagine how many people have tweeted self-righteous [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6697.5599999999995s)]
*  things on a phone that was made by slaves. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6701.679999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6704.88s)]
*  That's the reality of these phones [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6705.96s)]
*  and Apple's one of the richest fucking companies [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6708.76s)]
*  on planet Earth. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6712.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the logistics would be involved [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6714.48s)]
*  in making a phone in America with skilled labor [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6718.320000000001s)]
*  that gets paid a fair wage and gets health insurance [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6720.84s)]
*  and union benefits and all that stuff. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6725.2s)]
*  But whatever it is, I feel like I would like to pay that. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6726.64s)]
*  And we have coal. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6730.88s)]
*  And if I don't have the money, I'll buy less phones. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6731.72s)]
*  I'll buy a phone. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6734.84s)]
*  I have a fucking iPhone 11. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6735.88s)]
*  One of my phone lines is an iPhone 11. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6737.68s)]
*  It's great. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6739.84s)]
*  It still works. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6740.68s)]
*  Still seems so normal when I fire it up. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6741.88s)]
*  It doesn't seem any different to me. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6744.360000000001s)]
*  But do we have the mineral? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6745.88s)]
*  Do we have cobalt in America that we can mine? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6747.36s)]
*  I don't think we do in America. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6749.48s)]
*  That's the tricky thing. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6750.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6752.08s)]
*  Is cobalt available in America? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6752.92s)]
*  I thought it was only available in the Congo. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6754.84s)]
*  Well, that's where the primary source is for sure. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6757.04s)]
*  But I think there's at least one other place on Earth. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6759.4s)]
*  I don't remember correctly. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6762.88s)]
*  Ooh, Mexico. Mexico. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6766.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6767.0s)]
*  Mexico's this shit. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6768.2s)]
*  Listen, we have a problem with the cartels. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6769.04s)]
*  Let's just like, Mexico. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6771.32s)]
*  Do we have a problem with them? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6773.4s)]
*  Do we have a problem with the cartels [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6775.5599999999995s)]
*  or are we working with a cartel? [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6778.2s)]
*  Well, for sure someone's working with them. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6780.36s)]
*  I mean, it's not just like 100% Mexican citizens [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6783.0s)]
*  that are sneaking across here and doing all this business. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6786.12s)]
*  Someone's working with them. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6788.919999999999s)]
*  God damn, what is wrong with my throat? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6792.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, someone for sure is working with them. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6797.28s)]
*  But it's not good. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6799.799999999999s)]
*  It's not good to have this like fake scenario. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6800.799999999999s)]
*  You have a fake scenario. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6804.16s)]
*  We say drugs are bad. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6805.4s)]
*  If you make drugs illegal, no one's gonna do drugs. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6806.84s)]
*  Like, your math sucks, okay? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6809.2s)]
*  Because that's not the correct math. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6812.2s)]
*  The correct math is if you make drugs illegal, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6813.64s)]
*  then illegal people sell drugs. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6816.28s)]
*  You fucking asshole. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6818.92s)]
*  And so now you've propped up a multi-billion dollar [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6820.12s)]
*  industry south of the border filled with ruthless murderers. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6823.48s)]
*  Idaho. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6828.599999999999s)]
*  Is the only cobalt mine in the United States [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6829.48s)]
*  and it's going to remain so. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6831.4s)]
*  Okay, so we have some cobalt here. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6833.44s)]
*  I'm sure they could find some more. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6834.919999999999s)]
*  Maybe we have just enough for us. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6836.48s)]
*  How about just for us? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6838.16s)]
*  Let's like let the world make their own moral decisions. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6839.24s)]
*  But maybe if we legitimately are the moral high ground, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6842.48s)]
*  we could like encourage the rest of the world [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6846.879999999999s)]
*  to realize like the same thing we were talking about earlier [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6850.12s)]
*  about having too much money. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6852.32s)]
*  Like, just don't, you can't just think about, [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6853.4s)]
*  at a certain point in time, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6856.2s)]
*  you have to just figure out what's best for everybody. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6857.5599999999995s)]
*  And in this situation, if I was the king of the world, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6861.76s)]
*  if I was the king of America, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6865.0s)]
*  I would say how about we only make phones [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6866.72s)]
*  that are in America. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6871.320000000001s)]
*  We make American made phones with American, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6873.08s)]
*  we'll have sanitary conditions that are safe [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6876.08s)]
*  and provide healthcare. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6880.24s)]
*  All the things that you would hope someone working [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6883.68s)]
*  a fucking cobalt mine would get, give them a great wage. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6886.6s)]
*  Like make it so that this is an even exchange, [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6890.04s)]
*  it's not a negative exchange. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6892.92s)]
*  Protect them from all the, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6894.2s)]
*  and if we knew that the cobalt we're getting on our phone, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6895.92s)]
*  you don't have to worry. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6898.6s)]
*  These guys make $100,000 a year, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6899.48s)]
*  they're fucking well paid, [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6901.72s)]
*  they live in a great community. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6903.48s)]
*  Okay, great, now I don't feel bad about my phone. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6906.0s)]
*  But if you watch those videos from Foxconn, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6908.68s)]
*  you see those fucking poor people [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6911.0s)]
*  slaving away all day long in this sweatshop, [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6913.28s)]
*  16 hours a day, they have bunks there and shit. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6917.08s)]
*  They put nets around the building [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6920.320000000001s)]
*  to keep people from jumping off. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6921.280000000001s)]
*  That is so wild. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6923.16s)]
*  Instead of changing the conditions [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6924.84s)]
*  that these people have to work. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6926.4800000000005s)]
*  They won't let you kill you. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6927.320000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6928.68s)]
*  They're like, get back to work. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6929.76s)]
*  They grab you by your hair, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6931.08s)]
*  fucking drag you back down onto the floor. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6932.52s)]
*  You probably owe them money or something. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6934.52s)]
*  I mean, I don't know how they fucking do that. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6936.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tricky one. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6939.8s)]
*  Do you feel? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6940.92s)]
*  You would want everything you use in your everyday life [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6941.76s)]
*  to have a clean connection to ethically sourced materials, [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6945.36s)]
*  great relationships with workers, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6951.92s)]
*  no greedy corporations that are fucking over the environment. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6954.719999999999s)]
*  Everybody would want that. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6959.24s)]
*  I think they'd want that if they had excess. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6960.96s)]
*  I think most people are trying to pay their fucking rent. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6963.599999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6966.24s)]
*  And they're like, all right, if this is a little bit cheaper, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6967.08s)]
*  I have a little bit more money for my family, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6968.5599999999995s)]
*  my parents who are sick, and my kids. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6970.08s)]
*  I can buy them another fucking baseball mitt. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6972.839999999999s)]
*  And so they can't even consider people in the Congo. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6974.96s)]
*  And I think that's the tricky thing, where they know... [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6978.12s)]
*  It's almost like the Amazon situation, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6981.6s)]
*  where it's like most people probably know that Amazon [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6984.68s)]
*  might not be the best situation for mom and pop businesses, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6987.12s)]
*  but it's so convenient to them, and it's so much cheaper, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6990.08s)]
*  and it's so efficient that they just go, [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6993.4400000000005s)]
*  all right, well, this is great for me. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6995.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, there's that. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=6997.28s)]
*  It is interesting, but I think that [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7002.04s)]
*  in those circumstances, when there's people [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7004.400000000001s)]
*  that just can't afford to buy whatever it is, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7007.6s)]
*  ethically sourced and organically grown, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7010.4400000000005s)]
*  there should be other options. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7014.76s)]
*  But if there was a clear option that someone could take, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7016.16s)]
*  if a phone costs... [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7020.24s)]
*  $1,000. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7023.12s)]
*  $1,200, right? [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7023.64s)]
*  Article... [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7025.6s)]
*  I just looked up as saying that cell phones [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7026.56s)]
*  are not what's driving the cobalt price rise. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7029.4800000000005s)]
*  It is... [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7032.64s)]
*  A price rise. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7033.52s)]
*  Batteries. It's called batteries. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7034.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah, well, that was the... [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7036.6s)]
*  Like Teslas and shit? [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7037.52s)]
*  But that is what they use them in cell phones. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7038.64s)]
*  It's like lithium ion batteries. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7041.400000000001s)]
*  Eight grams of cobalt is in a cell phone. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7043.4400000000005s)]
*  And how much is in like a nine volt battery? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7046.88s)]
*  How much... [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7050.4400000000005s)]
*  Cobalt in a... [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7052.88s)]
*  I don't know what's in a nine volt, but the rechargeable battery. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7054.64s)]
*  That's okay. I see your point. You're right. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7057.320000000001s)]
*  It's like... [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7059.8s)]
*  It's everything electronics. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7061.360000000001s)]
*  We're thinking about it as cell phones, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7063.08s)]
*  but that's because cell phones are the primary... [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7064.6s)]
*  They just dominate our life. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7066.8s)]
*  ...method of communication and just... [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7068.04s)]
*  How many podcasts are listened to on cell phones? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7070.8s)]
*  All of them? [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7073.72s)]
*  Or is it like 90%? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7074.88s)]
*  Imagine if cell phones were made illegal [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7077.4800000000005s)]
*  and people still had to get podcasts. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7079.400000000001s)]
*  Done. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7081.16s)]
*  The majority of modern electric vehicles use these battery [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7082.76s)]
*  chemistries and lithium nickel manganese... [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7086.24s)]
*  Magnet? [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7089.16s)]
*  Manganese. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7090.0s)]
*  Manganese cobalt oxide. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7092.0s)]
*  In which have a cathode containing 10 to 20% cobalt. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7094.72s)]
*  And what was the cell phone? [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7098.72s)]
*  Eight grams. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7100.92s)]
*  Eight grams. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7101.8s)]
*  But that's a different measurement unit, right? [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7102.88s)]
*  One of them's percentage. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7104.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's trying to find... [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7106.04s)]
*  One of them's grams. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7106.88s)]
*  How many grams? [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7107.72s)]
*  Either way. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7109.32s)]
*  I mean, it's like... [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7110.16s)]
*  It's kind of for everything with lithium ion batteries. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7111.08s)]
*  It does something to stabilize it. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7113.32s)]
*  You know what it's like? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7115.0s)]
*  It's almost like asking 4 to 30 kilograms for a UV. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7116.12s)]
*  5%. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7119.8s)]
*  Okay, cell structure requires a minimum amount of cobalt, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7120.64s)]
*  about 5% and less lower energy density. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7123.12s)]
*  Lithium ion batteries without cobalt [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7126.12s)]
*  are used at the expense of performance. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7128.12s)]
*  A typical smartphone battery requires only [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7130.360000000001s)]
*  5 to 20 grams of cobalt, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7132.400000000001s)]
*  whereas an EV requires between 4 and 30 kilograms. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7134.64s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7140.16s)]
*  It's a lot more. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7141.52s)]
*  It's electric cars. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7142.360000000001s)]
*  Electric cars are fucking up the environment. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7144.32s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7148.0s)]
*  Isn't that like, what a conundrum? [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7149.88s)]
*  Life is funny. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7152.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's not just the environment. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7153.599999999999s)]
*  It's like, when I'm saying the environment, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7154.639999999999s)]
*  I'm like the frequency of the earth. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7156.92s)]

*  every electronic thing with lithium ion batteries [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7166.679999999999s)]

*  What are we doing? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7174.64s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7175.48s)]
*  Wild. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7176.32s)]
*  All the chitter chatter, all the talk about equality [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7178.16s)]
*  and equity and helping and charity and what about that? [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7182.16s)]
*  We're all personally responsible. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7186.84s)]
*  Yeah, bro, this ain't a secret. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7189.16s)]
*  It's not like a fucking X marks the spot in a pirate map. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7190.44s)]
*  Nope. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7193.32s)]
*  This is- Google. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7194.16s)]
*  Yeah, Google. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7195.0s)]
*  And I, as to Darth Carter on my podcast, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7195.92s)]
*  we talked about it in front of fucking millions of people. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7198.92s)]

*  Everybody would want a purple text. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7315.8s)]
*  Imagine a guy texts a girl with that purple text. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7317.28s)]

*  We gonna make them care about them. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7332.12s)]
*  I think the more disturbing thing would be [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7332.94s)]
*  the woman who has purple. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7334.08s)]

*  And then the man has green. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7336.5599999999995s)]
*  You hitting her with the green. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7337.38s)]

*  It's easily interceptable. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7341.719999999999s)]
*  I can't hit purple with green. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7342.92s)]

*  Yeah, this is out of colors on my palette. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7347.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7351.68s)]
*  Isn't it funny? [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7352.52s)]
*  The Android phone thing is very interesting. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7353.360000000001s)]
*  They were joking around about it [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7355.68s)]
*  because Brian Simpson uses an Android phone [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7357.04s)]
*  and I have Android Envy. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7359.12s)]
*  Because my main phone's an iPhone, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7360.8s)]
*  but I have an Android phone, too. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7362.12s)]
*  It's a good fucking phone. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7363.240000000001s)]
*  It's like, there's things that suck, though. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7364.8s)]
*  The fact that you can't send things through AirDrop. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7366.8s)]
*  AirDrop is big. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7369.240000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what Apple does. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7370.56s)]
*  It creates the moat. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7371.6s)]
*  Yeah, and iMessage is big. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7372.84s)]
*  They're smart. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7375.52s)]
*  They're very smart. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7376.360000000001s)]
*  They know what they're doing, man. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7377.18s)]
*  They're just so great at creating a moat [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7378.02s)]
*  and making everything so seamless for you. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7379.240000000001s)]
*  But they were all calling Brian Simpson a peasant. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7381.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, bro, he's got a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7383.160000000001s)]
*  That's a $1,400, $1,500 phone. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7387.6s)]
*  That's not a cheap phone. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7390.84s)]
*  It's the same price as a really expensive iPhone. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7392.280000000001s)]
*  It's the best Android phone you could get. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7395.04s)]
*  He's just stuck in a... [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7397.64s)]
*  But once you started with Samsung, it was poor. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7398.92s)]
*  The thing is, it's like you're in a different little world. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7402.48s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in that world. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7405.679999999999s)]
*  I'm part of the narrative. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7407.44s)]
*  I'm caught up in it, and I know it's bullshit, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7409.24s)]
*  and I know it's not true, and I know all the facts, [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7411.32s)]
*  and I know all the pixels and all that kind of shit [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7414.08s)]
*  from the Samsung are better. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7417.12s)]
*  And I see those videos where Samsung compares it [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7418.28s)]
*  to an iPhone, and it's way better [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7420.5599999999995s)]
*  in every different version of it. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7421.839999999999s)]
*  And I'm still like, this is... [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7423.62s)]
*  It's not way better. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7424.799999999999s)]
*  It's marginally better. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7426.32s)]
*  Oh, I thought it's like... [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7428.04s)]
*  The only thing that's way better is taking pictures [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7428.88s)]
*  of the moon, and it turns out it's not really [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7430.54s)]
*  taking pictures of the moon. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7432.58s)]
*  Dude, that's the best. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7434.42s)]
*  You're the best, the best. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7435.26s)]
*  Dude, that's why you gotta appreciate nerds, man. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7437.0199999999995s)]
*  You gotta appreciate these guys who are going out there, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7439.0199999999995s)]
*  fact checking everything. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7441.86s)]
*  Bro, they took a photo of a blurry photo [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7443.38s)]
*  of the moon on a screen. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7447.06s)]
*  Okay, so first of all, Samsung was claiming [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7449.26s)]
*  that their phone can take 100x zoom pictures, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7451.9s)]
*  and they proved it by taking pictures of the moon. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7455.28s)]
*  Well, it definitely can take 100x zoom pictures, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7456.12s)]
*  but you have to understand what it's doing [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7459.22s)]
*  with that moon shot is way stronger than 100x. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7462.34s)]
*  It's doing some shenanigans with artificial intelligence. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7467.34s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7470.46s)]
*  Because 100, if you do the 100 zoom on a galaxy ultra, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7471.3s)]
*  it's a legitimate zoom. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7476.18s)]
*  It's not just things that it knows are gonna be there, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7477.54s)]
*  like the moon, because the moon... [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7479.66s)]
*  You know the moon doesn't turn, do you know that? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7481.5s)]
*  What do you mean it doesn't turn? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7485.7s)]
*  The moon doesn't turn. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7486.780000000001s)]
*  We turn, the moon is locked into our orbit, [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7488.18s)]
*  and we see the same side of the moon, always. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7491.34s)]
*  But we turn. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7493.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but the moon turns with us. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7495.38s)]
*  So it turns at the exact same rate that we turn. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7496.9800000000005s)]
*  No, no, it follows us. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7498.860000000001s)]
*  So we're getting the version of the moon. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7501.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7503.02s)]
*  At the same time. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7503.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7504.900000000001s)]
*  But wait a minute, aren't we, so sun is here. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7505.740000000001s)]
*  We are... [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7508.38s)]
*  Pick up the skulls. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7509.22s)]
*  Yeah, so... [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7510.14s)]
*  So this is us. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7510.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7513.900000000001s)]
*  Hold on, this is gonna be... [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7514.740000000001s)]
*  This is us. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7515.94s)]
*  Right? [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7517.86s)]
*  Moon. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7518.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7519.7s)]
*  Moon is rotating around us, we're rotating around the sun. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7520.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7522.62s)]
*  So you're saying the moon is rotating around us [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7523.62s)]
*  the exact same speed. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7525.38s)]
*  The moon is rotating around us, but not rotating. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7526.46s)]
*  So it's not spinning. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7530.54s)]
*  As it's rotating. Oh, we spin. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7532.46s)]
*  We spin. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7533.58s)]
*  So it follows us. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7534.5s)]
*  Why doesn't it spin? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7535.5s)]
*  That I don't understand. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7536.5s)]
*  Because it follows us. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7537.34s)]
*  Like, say look, here's the palm of my hand. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7538.66s)]
*  Well, I'll show you right here, watch me, watch me. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7541.1s)]
*  Here's the palm of my hand, right? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7543.22s)]
*  Okay, now imagine this is the earth. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7544.7s)]
*  Imagine the earth is spinning. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7546.94s)]
*  Okay. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7548.22s)]
*  And the palm of my hand follows the earth as it spins. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7549.0599999999995s)]
*  But you only see this palm of my hand. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7551.9s)]
*  You don't see my knuckles, you don't see the back of my hand. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7553.9s)]
*  You see the palm of my hand, because it never spins. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7556.099999999999s)]
*  So the moon, when we see the moon, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7558.86s)]
*  so like if you're looking out and you see the moon, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7561.139999999999s)]
*  you see the same moon every night. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7563.139999999999s)]
*  Because you never see a moon that's spinning. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7564.58s)]
*  The moon doesn't spin. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7566.46s)]
*  Hence, dark side of the moon. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7567.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7569.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7571.94s)]
*  So that's why it's a moon and not an individual planet. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7572.78s)]
*  Because it's as big, it's actually bigger than Pluto, right? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7576.86s)]
*  And Pluto was a planet for a long time. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7581.0599999999995s)]
*  An individual planet would be locked [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7582.9s)]
*  into the gravity of the sun. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7583.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7584.94s)]
*  But since it's locked in our gravity. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7585.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7587.179999999999s)]
*  It's a moon, yeah. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7588.179999999999s)]
*  You know, that's, see how it works? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7591.099999999999s)]
*  See how as the earth spins, the moon gives us [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7593.7s)]
*  the same face constantly. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7597.0199999999995s)]
*  So we come around and see it, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7598.7s)]
*  because the moon's gone, then the moon's there. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7600.219999999999s)]
*  But we always see the same side. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7602.38s)]
*  Anything interesting? [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7603.66s)]
*  Aliens. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7604.5s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7605.34s)]
*  Aliens and Nazis, mostly Nazis. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7606.18s)]
*  Nazis. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7607.22s)]
*  The aliens picked the worst group of people [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7613.02s)]
*  to collaborate with. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7615.18s)]
*  Or the best. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7617.54s)]
*  What if aliens just cared about technology so much, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7618.820000000001s)]
*  they're like, oh, these guys got some good ideas. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7621.5s)]
*  And they didn't even learn about any of the other shit. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7623.38s)]
*  They just were like, who understands [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7625.58s)]
*  rocket propulsion the best? [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7626.900000000001s)]
*  Imagine if they thought about us [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7628.66s)]
*  the same way we think about wasps. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7630.38s)]
*  Where it's just like, it doesn't matter, I'll pick one. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7632.5s)]
*  Let them kill each other. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7634.34s)]
*  But they're really good at designing engines. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7636.1s)]
*  And eventually we get up there and we go, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7638.14s)]
*  listen, buddy, there's some pretty bad other shit going on [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7640.14s)]
*  with the Nazis. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7644.900000000001s)]
*  And we have to explain to them what Jewish people are. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7645.9400000000005s)]
*  Imagine that conversation. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7649.42s)]
*  Yeah, oh well, okay, but the engines are amazing. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7651.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7654.46s)]
*  BMW's the shit. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7658.14s)]
*  They're into the cars. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7661.06s)]
*  Have you seen an SL500? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7662.3s)]
*  Bro, E46, BMW M3, shut the fuck up. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7663.62s)]
*  Shut up. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7667.9800000000005s)]
*  So is that the thing? [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7669.26s)]
*  Is that what they think? [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7670.34s)]
*  Is that the conspiracy? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7671.18s)]
*  Give me the conspiracy, no facts associated whatsoever. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7672.900000000001s)]
*  Well, the conspiracy is that there was connections [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7675.780000000001s)]
*  between the Nazis and the occult. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7679.3s)]
*  And this is the thing that they always talk about. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7682.3s)]
*  Like maybe even Satanism, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7684.42s)]
*  maybe even summoning evil entities from other dimensions [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7686.86s)]
*  and that, the real conspiracy is that, [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7691.339999999999s)]
*  if you think about the amount of horrific things they did, [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7694.179999999999s)]
*  they were absolutely abhorrent, absolutely contrary to [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7698.099999999999s)]
*  what we would think of as being the best values [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7703.099999999999s)]
*  of human nature. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7706.46s)]
*  And the whole country got behind this. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7707.58s)]
*  How did that happen? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7709.62s)]
*  How did they kill so many people? [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7711.139999999999s)]
*  If you were a person who was inclined to, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7712.9s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm not. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7716.46s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't believe in demons and Satan. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7718.46s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7723.06s)]
*  Cause I think that's foolish too. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7724.54s)]
*  Imagine if it was real. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7726.46s)]
*  So just completely right now, yeah. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7727.3s)]
*  You see that type of evil, you go, [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7728.78s)]
*  okay, well maybe that's associated with something. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7730.22s)]
*  But you gotta think something happened during that time [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7731.9400000000005s)]
*  where the world dipped into a darker dimension [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7738.58s)]
*  than it's ever experienced, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7741.82s)]
*  at least in the lifetimes of those people [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7743.9400000000005s)]
*  that experienced that. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7745.5s)]
*  Like what is that? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7747.38s)]
*  What the fuck causes that? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7748.9s)]
*  Is that demons? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7750.9s)]
*  So you think that they tap into something. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7751.74s)]
*  They tap into a dark energy. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7753.06s)]
*  I think it's a part of everything and maybe a part of us, [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7754.38s)]
*  which is why you can talk about the Mongols [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7757.62s)]
*  and what the fuck they did [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7759.94s)]
*  and why you talk about the Comanches. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7761.06s)]
*  And now it took like a hundred years [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7762.98s)]
*  for people to conquer Texas [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7764.62s)]
*  because they just kept getting slaughtered. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7766.3s)]
*  Unbelievable savages. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7768.78s)]
*  Kidding me, everybody got slaughtered. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7769.62s)]
*  Well they also had that horse tech. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7771.3s)]
*  They have horse tech. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7772.78s)]
*  They also had multiple arrows in their fingers [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7773.98s)]
*  and these dudes had muskets. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7777.179999999999s)]
*  It was musket time. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7779.219999999999s)]
*  It wasn't until they came up with the Colt 45. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7780.419999999999s)]
*  It wasn't Colt 45. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7783.219999999999s)]
*  It was- [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7784.339999999999s)]
*  The Revolver. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7785.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Colt Revolver. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7786.0199999999995s)]
*  Colt Revolver. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7786.98s)]
*  Colt Revolver was the first time [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7787.82s)]
*  they ever could shoot more than once at a time [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7789.98s)]
*  and it changed the game. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7792.339999999999s)]
*  Not enough spoken about that in history [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7793.78s)]
*  and how that like carved out America on the planet. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7795.62s)]
*  Did the Colt 45 create America? [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7800.78s)]
*  It wasn't a Colt 45, whatever the Colt Revolver. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7803.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7805.38s)]
*  Create America. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7806.22s)]
*  It kind of did because if someone didn't come up, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7807.18s)]
*  you know they didn't think that was necessary in war [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7809.38s)]
*  so they weren't even gonna like utilize it. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7811.9400000000005s)]
*  And then the Texas Rangers were the first people to go, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7814.18s)]
*  I think I see a fucking need to shoot multiple bullets. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7816.700000000001s)]
*  Cause these guys got four ass. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7819.860000000001s)]
*  And rapid fire. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7820.700000000001s)]
*  Cause these guys were riding on horseback, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7821.540000000001s)]
*  shooting under the horse's neck. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7824.06s)]
*  So they would dip to the side of the horse. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7826.660000000001s)]
*  They would hang themselves on the side. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7828.3s)]
*  They would hold on to the side of the horse [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7830.38s)]
*  and they would shoot past the horse's neck. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7833.14s)]
*  What is holding them on the side? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7835.0199999999995s)]
*  Are they saddles or are they bareback? [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7836.5s)]
*  They would do bareback. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7838.54s)]
*  They would hold on. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7840.0599999999995s)]
*  They had incredible grip with their legs. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7841.3s)]
*  But they had like different reins and things [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7843.46s)]
*  and ways they would hold on to the horses. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7846.0599999999995s)]
*  But you would just hang on to the horse [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7848.38s)]
*  and shoot underneath its body. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7851.1s)]
*  So it used its body as a shield. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7853.46s)]
*  As a fucking shield. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7855.3s)]
*  Until bang, bang, bang, bang. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7858.38s)]
*  Good luck. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7861.42s)]
*  And they're like, oh no. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7862.9400000000005s)]
*  It's over. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7864.06s)]
*  Apparently there's some wild stories [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7864.900000000001s)]
*  about medicine men that blessed their warriors. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7869.02s)]
*  They were real shaman. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7875.42s)]
*  And then there was also con men. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7877.14s)]
*  Even in the world of Native Americans. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7878.860000000001s)]
*  We want to think about Native Americans. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7881.14s)]
*  They were in tune with the land. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7882.860000000001s)]
*  They also had snake oil salesmen. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7885.46s)]
*  They only had snake oil salesmen. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7887.26s)]
*  They did. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7889.02s)]
*  So they had fake medicine men. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7889.860000000001s)]
*  They would tell them, I will put a spell on you [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7891.26s)]
*  and you will never be killed by the white man's bullet. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7893.34s)]
*  And so they would do this fucking, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7896.1s)]
*  they were just making it up. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7897.66s)]
*  And then all of a sudden this dude's got a Henry rifle [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7898.740000000001s)]
*  and he's shooting from 200 yards. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7901.740000000001s)]
*  The Henry rifle is the? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7903.9400000000005s)]
*  A Henry rifle is like an old school wild west rifle. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7905.22s)]
*  And they were shooting people. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7909.7s)]
*  What does a Henry rifle look like? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7911.02s)]
*  It is a pump action, right? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7913.34s)]
*  The old school ones? [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7915.58s)]
*  Show me a photo of one of them. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7916.740000000001s)]
*  Well the Henry rifles, they still make Henry rifles today. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7918.58s)]
*  They make some dope rifles. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7922.14s)]
*  But this is back then. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7922.9800000000005s)]
*  And then this dude's head's exploding 100 yards away. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7924.54s)]
*  And they're like, oh no. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7927.26s)]
*  Because now they're realizing [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7928.740000000001s)]
*  these guys can shoot from really far. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7929.860000000001s)]
*  They can shoot from several hundred yards away [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7932.46s)]
*  with some of these more modern rifles. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7935.1s)]
*  That's a good point. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7937.42s)]
*  When did rifles become accurate? [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7938.26s)]
*  Because my understanding of the muskets [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7940.34s)]
*  was it was kind of a guess. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7941.700000000001s)]
*  Kind of a guess. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7943.46s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7944.38s)]
*  Right? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7945.22s)]
*  I was reading a little bit about muskets [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7946.66s)]
*  and it was like, I think it was, [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7948.46s)]
*  it wasn't until they did the spiral barrel [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7949.42s)]
*  or something like that? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7951.9800000000005s)]
*  It's called rifling. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7952.82s)]
*  That's why it's called a rifle. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7953.66s)]
*  See the difference between a rifle and a musket [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7955.06s)]
*  is not just the way the powder knocks. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7956.9400000000005s)]
*  You have a flint and the flint will make a spark. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7960.22s)]
*  It would light the gunpowder and the ball would go. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7962.9800000000005s)]
*  But a rifle actually has rifling. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7965.38s)]
*  So there's like a pattern to the barrel. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7967.82s)]
*  So it spins the bullet as it comes out. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7970.38s)]
*  Okay, so you shot that arrow today, right? [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7973.02s)]
*  If you notice the back of the arrow, it has fletchings. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7975.5s)]
*  Those are the wings on it. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7978.42s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7979.9s)]
*  And now in the old days, those were feathers. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7981.34s)]
*  They would use them to steer the arrow, [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7983.58s)]
*  but now we use like a plastic. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7985.22s)]
*  And those feathers, those are AAE max vanes. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7987.42s)]
*  And so they're all like at an angle and there's four of them. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7992.58s)]
*  So as that arrow's coming, it's twisting and turning. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7996.38s)]
*  You want the turn because the spin [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=7999.9400000000005s)]
*  is what creates the accuracy. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8002.22s)]
*  Exactly, it keeps it accurate. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8003.5s)]
*  And then there's also broad heads [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8005.14s)]
*  that accentuate the damage that's caused by the spin. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8007.12s)]
*  There's a type of broad head called [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8010.84s)]
*  a single bevel broad head. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8012.8s)]
*  So like this is a real Native American broad head. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8014.4s)]
*  That's a real one. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8017.04s)]
*  So this would be the tip of an arrow. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8018.08s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8019.5599999999995s)]
*  This is an on an arrow. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8020.4s)]
*  That was, you know, who knows how many hundreds of years old [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8021.32s)]
*  before someone pulled it out of the ground. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8024.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8026.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's old as fuck. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8027.76s)]
*  I mean, maybe it was from the 1800s, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8030.2s)]
*  maybe it was from the 1700s. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8031.92s)]
*  But so that is an ancient broad head, right? [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8034.04s)]
*  Now a modern one, they have ones that have an edge [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8037.78s)]
*  like this on one side, but not on the other. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8041.379999999999s)]
*  Explain that. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8044.299999999999s)]
*  And what happens is, so like, see how there's an edge here [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8045.139999999999s)]
*  and there's an edge here on both sides, okay? [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8048.0599999999995s)]
*  If it's beveled in on both sides to a point, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8050.9s)]
*  it looks like a tipi, right? [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8054.9s)]
*  But if it's only on one side, it looks like that. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8057.54s)]
*  And when it's on one side, it causes it to spin [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8061.0599999999995s)]
*  through the body cavity. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8064.58s)]
*  Oh, so it just tears up your body when it gets in. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8065.94s)]
*  Yeah, it continues to spin. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8068.5s)]
*  That's called a single bevel broad head. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8070.66s)]
*  It's like a holo tip, their version of a holo tip. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8072.94s)]
*  Their version of a holo tip, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8076.219999999999s)]
*  but very good because it penetrates bone [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8077.339999999999s)]
*  because it's a single blade. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8080.74s)]
*  There's a lot going on with those things, man. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8083.099999999999s)]
*  When you see in the movies where they do the thing [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8086.0599999999995s)]
*  where they snap the arrow and they pull it out, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8089.219999999999s)]
*  I guess, the other side. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8092.259999999999s)]
*  You could do that. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8094.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's say you get shot with an arrow. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8095.86s)]
*  Arrow stuck. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8097.5s)]
*  Is it just yank out the opposite way? [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8098.78s)]
*  Or is it snap? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8101.419999999999s)]
*  No, you wanna push it through. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8102.54s)]
*  And then push it through. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8103.9s)]
*  Yeah, if it's poking out your back, [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8104.74s)]
*  definitely don't try to pull it back. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8106.9s)]
*  100%. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8109.259999999999s)]
*  Also, leave it in. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8110.099999999999s)]
*  If you get shot with an arrow [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8111.379999999999s)]
*  and it's poking down to your body, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8112.62s)]
*  leave it in and get to a hospital. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8113.7s)]
*  Because you'll be able to stop the bleeding [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8115.46s)]
*  hopefully in the hospital, but if it just starts to go. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8116.86s)]
*  The arrow in your body will help stop bleeding far more [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8118.9s)]
*  than pulling the arrow free. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8122.82s)]
*  Then everything will just bleed. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8123.98s)]
*  And then also like the, what is this? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8127.0199999999995s)]
*  This guy got hit by it? [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8129.379999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, he got shot in the eyeball during a riot? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8130.86s)]
*  He got shot in the eyeball with an arrow. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8134.179999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8136.099999999999s)]
*  That's so insane. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8137.54s)]
*  How much accuracy do you have [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8138.86s)]
*  when you're shooting a parabola? [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8142.419999999999s)]
*  So you're not shooting straight like we did today. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8145.7s)]
*  But when you're going for distance [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8147.82s)]
*  and it's just up in the air, [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8149.299999999999s)]
*  like you see in medieval fights. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8150.5s)]
*  How much accuracy is that? [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8153.62s)]
*  Like just fucking plainly. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8154.82s)]
*  Well, you never do that, right? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8155.78s)]
*  Like if you're trying to shoot an animal, [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8157.7s)]
*  does that mean? [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8159.74s)]
*  No, no, I mean like when it's like human to human. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8160.58s)]
*  You're just shooting because- [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8162.82s)]
*  You have to judge it. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8163.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8164.58s)]
*  It's like throwing a softball. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8166.34s)]
*  I don't do that kind of archery [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8168.14s)]
*  so I'm speaking a little bit out of tune. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8169.62s)]
*  But when you throw a softball, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8171.5s)]
*  like if you throw a lot of balls or a hardball, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8174.94s)]
*  you get accustomed to like how it feels [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8177.62s)]
*  when you let that ball go [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8180.46s)]
*  and you know where that catcher's mitts gonna be. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8181.86s)]
*  With football, if you're going long, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8183.9s)]
*  you're just sending it, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8185.62s)]
*  You don't get as much information from an arrow, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8186.98s)]
*  a bow and arrow because it's like [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8190.82s)]
*  you're launching something, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8192.3s)]
*  whereas this is you're throwing something. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8193.9s)]
*  But it's kind of similar in that there's a feedback loop. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8195.58s)]
*  And then as you shoot more arrows, [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8198.74s)]
*  you get more and more accustomed [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8201.66s)]
*  to knowing where that arrow's gonna go with distance. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8203.98s)]
*  But it's a brutal process of elimination and information [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8207.14s)]
*  and calculation and it's not easy. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8211.699999999999s)]
*  Like what we did today is so much easier [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8214.5s)]
*  than like a recurve bow. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8217.58s)]
*  When you're just having like a wood bow [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8220.099999999999s)]
*  and you're like, ah, poink, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8221.939999999999s)]
*  like you have to release it yourself. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8224.82s)]
*  You're using your fingers to let it go. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8226.9s)]
*  I mean, I don't have any ego to say [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8229.14s)]
*  that there's no way I could hold it back [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8232.98s)]
*  and maintain the accuracy. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8235.859999999999s)]
*  Well, it's like something else. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8237.58s)]
*  It's like anything else. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8239.42s)]
*  You have to build on it. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8240.46s)]
*  Like you wouldn't just get good at it really quick. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8241.46s)]
*  That's strength, dude. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8243.3s)]
*  Like that is, yeah, when I pulled it back and it locked, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8244.14s)]
*  I was like, okay, I can kind of focus on this front part [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8248.38s)]
*  a bit, but then my hand is all fucking shaky. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8251.939999999999s)]
*  This is John Dudley doing a 500 yard bow shot. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8255.9s)]
*  It kinda comes down, it doesn't go like straight. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8261.099999999999s)]
*  It comes down on this thing. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8263.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8264.82s)]
*  Because you gotta think, [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8265.699999999999s)]
*  it's not going that fast. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8267.3s)]
*  Are you calculating wind and shit? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8270.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, you definitely would for that. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8272.38s)]
*  So he's just trying to land on his target. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8276.779999999999s)]
*  Far. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8280.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's just crazy. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8281.06s)]
*  John did a thing for us back at on it [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8284.34s)]
*  where he shot, Jesus Christ. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8287.179999999998s)]
*  Got something in my throat. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8291.699999999999s)]
*  Save that voice, we got shows tonight, Joe. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8293.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a swallowed something. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8295.58s)]
*  John had a, I think it was 120 yard shot into a kettlebell. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8298.34s)]
*  Yeah, this is it, look at this. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8303.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is great. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8305.58s)]
*  So he shot it into the handle of a gorilla kettlebell. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8306.42s)]
*  Look at that, bam. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8308.82s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8309.94s)]
*  It's crazy, oh, it was lit, right? [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8310.86s)]
*  Yeah, his lighted knocks. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8312.7s)]
*  But you know how wild that is, that shot? [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8314.62s)]
*  I mean, that's insane. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8319.46s)]
*  But you can't do that with a regular bow. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8322.3s)]
*  Like a recurve bow, that's not available. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8326.539999999999s)]
*  You can only do that with a compound bow. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8329.3s)]
*  But they did have some recurve bows that would be like, [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8333.1s)]
*  the Mongols had ones that would take 160 pounds [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8336.34s)]
*  to draw back, so if you think about the bow. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8339.42s)]
*  Today was what? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8341.7s)]
*  80. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8342.7s)]
*  So that one was 80, now imagine double that. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8343.9s)]
*  Forget it, dude. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8346.14s)]
*  And you have to hold it, it's like. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8346.98s)]
*  And then aim it. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8348.3s)]
*  I mean, they must have just been fucking jocked. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8349.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8352.26s)]
*  It must have been 160 pound bows, that's crazy. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8353.62s)]
*  I wanna read more about that. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8357.02s)]
*  I just wanna, yeah, just what is the competitive advantage [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8360.38s)]
*  with all these different groups? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8364.02s)]
*  Like what was the Romans' competitive advantage, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8365.46s)]
*  do you know? [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8367.42s)]
*  If I had to guess, they had a high level of sophistication [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8368.58s)]
*  when it came to military strategy. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8373.66s)]
*  They had, you know, I mean, they had so much money. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8375.82s)]
*  So it's just money. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8380.539999999999s)]
*  I think that's a big part of it. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8381.38s)]
*  How does it not have to, I mean, [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8382.38s)]
*  if you wanna arm your people and you wanna pay them [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8383.779999999999s)]
*  and pay your soldiers, you wanna give them fucking armor [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8386.539999999999s)]
*  and weapons and shit, like, the more money you have, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8389.14s)]
*  the more weapons, the more horses, the more everything. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8391.74s)]
*  Resources. Stealing from people. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8394.019999999999s)]
*  So they're just like going in, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8395.619999999999s)]
*  they're taking all the shit and then. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8397.34s)]
*  I would imagine there's a lot of things going on. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8399.34s)]
*  Wait, wait, that actually makes sense. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8400.98s)]
*  That, if your business is, you're essentially like a pirate. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8402.619999999999s)]
*  Like if your business is just conquest and then stealing, [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8407.539999999999s)]
*  you need to continue to expand the empire [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8410.06s)]
*  to continue to feed it. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8412.74s)]
*  And then the bigger the empire gets, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8413.859999999999s)]
*  the less that money affects the rest of the empire. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8416.939999999999s)]
*  So you reach a certain level where you just can't sustain it. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8419.22s)]
*  Yes. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8422.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8423.619999999999s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8425.42s)]
*  Yeah, you just go crazy. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8426.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8428.34s)]
*  You go crazy like the son of a rich man [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8429.18s)]
*  is doing coke in a mansion. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8431.859999999999s)]
*  You just go fucking crazy. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8433.5s)]
*  Bro, that's what they said. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8434.699999999999s)]

*  What was his name? Oh, fuck. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8441.26s)]
*  And they said it was the lead pipes. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8444.1s)]
*  He didn't drink from the water. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8447.54s)]
*  Marcus Aurelius, his son was. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8449.78s)]
*  Oh, Commodus. No, no, no, no. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8452.380000000001s)]
*  What was Marcus Aurelius' son? The evil son, right? [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8455.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Zeno, Zeno. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8457.5s)]
*  Zenit. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8459.94s)]
*  Doesn't matter. But I guess they said that. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8462.34s)]
*  Joaquin Phoenix. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8464.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8466.5s)]
*  Commodus. Oh, you're right. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8467.42s)]
*  I was right. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8468.34s)]
*  OK, maybe it wasn't a function of just like this guy came up [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8469.18s)]
*  in extreme wealth and opportunity and whatever. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8472.94s)]
*  Maybe it was a function of like they didn't understand [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8475.42s)]
*  the lead pipes made you fucking crazy. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8477.58s)]
*  And for the first time, he was he was every bit of water [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8479.34s)]
*  that he drank was from those lead pipes. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8482.82s)]
*  Oh, my for the first time. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8484.460000000001s)]
*  Think about it. You don't. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8486.54s)]
*  Well, he was the first person like that. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8487.66s)]
*  That generation was the first generation. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8489.62s)]
*  Well, Aurelius was was Aurelius born into it. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8491.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8494.66s)]
*  Because when I was in Rome and I was looking. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8496.220000000001s)]
*  Is this like a widely studied theory? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8497.78s)]
*  The lead pipe. This was a guy told me in in [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8499.62s)]
*  when I was at the Coliseum. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8502.66s)]
*  Definitely an article in Science about it. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8503.66s)]
*  Did lead poisoning bring down ancient Rome? [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8505.58s)]
*  Because they didn't know for them, like the idea that there was [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8507.380000000001s)]
*  there was like water and there was accessible water [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8509.7s)]
*  that was actually good for you was for the rich only. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8512.140000000001s)]
*  And what if that's all you had? [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8515.74s)]
*  Of course, you're going to go crazy because at the beginning of his reign, [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8516.980000000001s)]
*  he wasn't that crazy. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8519.140000000001s)]
*  And then my man just went wild. So. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8520.02s)]
*  Yeah, it could have been the lead pipe. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8524.300000000001s)]
*  Tap water from ancient Rome likely contained 100 times more lead [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8525.5s)]
*  than local spring water. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8530.18s)]
*  And all the poor people don't have fucking plumbing. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8532.02s)]
*  So they're getting water from a river. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8534.34s)]
*  Isn't that a little bit of karma? [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8535.58s)]
*  And that a little bit of karma? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8538.02s)]
*  Life works in mysterious ways. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8539.14s)]
*  Sometimes the universe. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8540.98s)]
*  Oh, it will. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8543.1s)]
*  Sometimes the universe just sends you a message. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8544.02s)]
*  Remember when Heather McDonald blacked out on stage [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8547.3s)]
*  was just talking about the vaccine? [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8549.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't mean to diss on her. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8551.42s)]
*  She's a nice lady. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8553.14s)]
*  But is there ever been a time where the universe is like, yo, bro, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8554.3s)]
*  have you hang on? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8559.14s)]
*  There's a compilation like, have you seen the the the the the [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8560.14s)]
*  in like the gay dancing where they do like the fall? [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8563.699999999999s)]
*  Yes, I have that. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8567.18s)]
*  Yes, there's a compilation. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8568.3s)]
*  There's a compilation of all the different people blacking out [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8569.98s)]
*  of all the people like falling as part of the gay dancing. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8571.9s)]
*  And then Heather just dropping. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8574.06s)]
*  Yeah, but she was she was really going off about how proud she was [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8575.779999999999s)]
*  about like being boosted a few times and high. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8579.099999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8583.26s)]

*  How about that? [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8590.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8591.74s)]
*  Drop. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8592.3s)]
*  That's why people believe in God. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8592.82s)]
*  Well, OK, stuff like that. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8594.74s)]
*  You know, maybe there is a fucking someone watching over. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8596.34s)]
*  I hope so. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8599.38s)]
*  I hope so, too. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8600.5s)]
*  And what if religion is just the language that you can speak to him [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8601.82s)]
*  as he speaks to you? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8605.26s)]
*  Yeah, because they all more or less say the same things. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8606.74s)]
*  Very similar. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8609.82s)]
*  And what if they're up there? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8610.94s)]
*  They're going, I don't really mind what language you speak, [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8612.220000000001s)]
*  as long as you're doing these things, because I think it will help you. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8614.94s)]
*  It's not even like a narcissism thing, which is like, hey, [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8618.140000000001s)]
*  if you do these things, you're probably going to live a better life [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8620.62s)]
*  and enjoy this life, this gift that I've given you. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8623.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8626.220000000001s)]

*  I was raised with no religion, but it's like, [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8634.42s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8639.300000000001s)]
*  That's Jordan Peterson's position, too. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8639.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8641.98s)]
*  I think there's something to it. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8643.26s)]
*  There certainly could be. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8645.98s)]
*  Do you think there's someone out there? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8647.42s)]
*  I don't think we should think of it as a someone, [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8653.38s)]
*  because I have a feeling that's part of the problem. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8657.14s)]
*  We pretended to have got some dude in a skirt, a fucking robe in the sky. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8659.619999999999s)]
*  They wear clothes. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8666.18s)]
*  And back before they had cell phones, like, what? [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8667.46s)]
*  God, really? [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8670.66s)]
*  What is that? [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8672.019999999999s)]
*  Why are we depicting him like that? [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8673.22s)]
*  If you just are honest about how people tell stories, [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8675.339999999998s)]
*  if you just really just don't think about what you know to be true [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8678.3s)]
*  and what you believe and what your faith tells you, [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8683.82s)]
*  just like what you know about human beings and stories, [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8686.58s)]
*  every time human beings have told a story, [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8690.339999999998s)]
*  if you wanted to talk to someone from Oliver North's family [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8694.1s)]
*  about what happened with Rick Ross and cocaine sales in South Central Los Angeles, [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8698.22s)]
*  did they use the money to fund the Contras versus the Sandinistas in Nicaragua? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8703.82s)]
*  Oh, they would never do that. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8708.619999999999s)]
*  Like, what? [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8709.58s)]
*  They would never do that. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8710.14s)]
*  His family doesn't believe that, right? [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8710.74s)]
*  Because they have a very specific narrative. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8712.3s)]
*  And then 100 years from now, Ronald Reagan would be the greatest, [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8713.939999999999s)]
*  most noble American that's ever lived. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8717.26s)]
*  And to some people, he is today. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8719.06s)]
*  So it's like these narratives shift and swing and change over time, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8721.46s)]
*  depending on who tells them, which is why censorship is so dangerous [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8726.66s)]
*  and what's why ideological narratives are so dangerous. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8731.3s)]
*  Because if you don't tell me the truth about history, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8734.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know what to not fuck up again. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8737.06s)]
*  But what is the truth about how we treat each other? [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8740.859999999999s)]
*  I feel like there is a truth there. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8743.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8745.14s)]
*  And I think there are, well, you can judge a religion by its fruit. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8745.5s)]
*  There's a reason why Judaism was successful. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8751.380000000001s)]
*  There's a reason why Christianity comes around and it's successful. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8754.74s)]
*  And there's a reason why Islam comes around and it's successful. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8757.5s)]
*  It has to have fruit. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8759.9s)]
*  It can't just be, I'm forcing you to do this. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8760.98s)]
*  The people have to enjoy what they're getting from it for it to be successful. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8763.34s)]
*  100%. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8766.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8767.58s)]
*  So they needed it in the time. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8768.06s)]
*  I almost wonder if you look at religions as girlfriends. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8772.58s)]
*  Every new one is a reaction to the last one. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8777.220000000001s)]
*  Judaism was very strict and there's all these rules [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8780.54s)]
*  and you can't eat this and you can't do that. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8783.1s)]
*  And then Christianity comes around and it's just like, [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8785.1s)]
*  hey, bro, I love you. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8787.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8789.5s)]
*  Hey, you did something fucked up. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8790.5s)]
*  I love you. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8792.9s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8793.62s)]
*  Right? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8795.74s)]
*  Like there's some... [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8796.02s)]
*  Just say you're sorry. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8796.58s)]
*  Say you're sorry. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8797.9s)]
*  That's it. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8798.5s)]
*  Just say you're sorry. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8799.5s)]
*  And I love you. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8801.58s)]
*  Come to heaven. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8802.26s)]
*  And then it got too crazy maybe. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8803.38s)]
*  Not too crazy, but then maybe it was taking advantage of too much. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8805.9s)]
*  It was like, I don't even need much from you. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8808.9s)]
*  And then people were like, all right, well, I'm not going to do much. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8810.5s)]
*  And then Islam comes around and it's like, oh, you weren't even praying once every week? [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8813.779999999999s)]
*  Like now you're going to do it five times a day. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8819.38s)]
*  Five times a day. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8821.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8822.46s)]
*  Happy Ramadan, by the way. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8822.94s)]
*  I think today is the first day of Ramadan. [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8823.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8825.26s)]
*  But like, I don't know. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8826.1s)]
*  I just feel like it's a function of like what humans might need. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8827.58s)]
*  Like I almost think about like, like what is popular now in society and culture? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8830.98s)]
*  Like these figures? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8837.34s)]
*  Jordan is a perfect example. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8838.82s)]
*  Like you're a perfect example. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8839.9s)]
*  Like I think we as Americans have kind of like left religion, we still need the structure. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8841.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8847.22s)]
*  And like even like telling somebody get in an ice bath in the morning. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8847.78s)]
*  Like that's a religious act. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8852.62s)]
*  Maybe it's not done for God, but there's a consistency there. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8854.18s)]
*  There's something that you do that makes you feel good. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8857.98s)]
*  Like I feel like we've found a way to like a la carte the different structures that religion [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8860.06s)]
*  provided us now that we don't have religion. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8864.74s)]
*  Yeah, I'm glad you said that about the ice bath because I think that sometimes it is [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8867.02s)]
*  a ritual for me. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8870.300000000001s)]
*  And it's also like a silent thing. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8871.42s)]
*  I'm doing it completely by myself. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8873.060000000001s)]
*  And the just commitment to it, I think there's something. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8875.54s)]
*  Also, it's like super uncomfortable. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8879.26s)]
*  And when it's super uncomfortable, but you still do it every day, it's like you get like [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8881.7s)]
*  a little bit of a, you win one little battle every day. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8884.94s)]
*  What about religion has to be comfortable for you? [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8888.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8890.9s)]
*  Religion doesn't have to be comfortable. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8891.7s)]
*  That's why there's something good in that one. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8893.5s)]
*  It's like there's like a physical barrier that you have to get through for three minutes [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8895.58s)]
*  every day. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8899.5s)]
*  And if you can get through that barrier, like you will have like a better day. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8900.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8904.22s)]
*  Which seems so stupid. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8904.74s)]
*  I mean, I'll be honest with you, bro. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8906.42s)]
*  I ain't doing that shit. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8907.86s)]
*  I tried it. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8908.98s)]
*  I can't. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8909.62s)]
*  I don't like the cold, bro. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8911.26s)]
*  You think I like it? [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8913.3s)]
*  I think you like defeating it. [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8915.42s)]
*  You don't defeat it. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8918.3s)]
*  You never win. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8920.38s)]
*  I think you like challenge. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8920.86s)]
*  And I think you like conquering challenge. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8923.26s)]
*  You just, you don't conquer this. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8925.3s)]
*  You just tolerate it. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8927.46s)]
*  That's the best part. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8928.539999999999s)]
*  You can never win. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8929.58s)]
*  Is that the win though? [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8930.34s)]
*  Conquering it? [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8931.26s)]
*  You can never win. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8931.66s)]
*  It's going to be 34 degrees to the end of time. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8932.22s)]
*  How long can you hang out in there? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8934.539999999999s)]
*  You don't win. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8936.779999999999s)]
*  You know, you never win with the cold plunge. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8938.779999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's the... [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8940.779999999999s)]
*  You can't defeat it. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8941.58s)]
*  That's the ego check. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8942.539999999999s)]
*  You can't be like, oh, I'm the fucking freeze man. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8943.019999999999s)]
*  You know, even Wim Hof has to get out of the ice bath. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8946.779999999999s)]
*  You have to get out. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8949.98s)]
*  You'll die. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8950.619999999999s)]
*  So maybe that's the humility. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8951.38s)]
*  Maybe that's like, it's related to something like the jujitsu of it. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8952.58s)]
*  Like you're going to get tapped by somebody. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8956.58s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8959.02s)]
*  There's something to that for sure. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8959.539999999999s)]
*  And maybe we need that. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8961.14s)]
*  Maybe we need to be humbled. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8962.02s)]
*  It's healthy for us to be humbled. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8963.98s)]
*  I think you need something that takes away your ability to control it. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8965.06s)]
*  And the cold plunge is uniquely good because it's voluntary. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8969.02s)]
*  Like no one's forcing you to do it. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8974.1s)]
*  You climb in there. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8975.38s)]
*  You have a little victory by getting yourself in there. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8976.38s)]
*  And then you like watch a timer and count it down. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8979.58s)]
*  And when three minutes are up, you get out and you won. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8982.34s)]
*  You won. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8984.78s)]
*  You did it. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8985.26s)]
*  It sucked. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8985.9s)]
*  You didn't want to do it. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8986.5s)]
*  But you did it. [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8987.460000000001s)]
*  So now the whole day is like, you know how to suck it up. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8988.26s)]
*  You know how to deal with bullshit. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8992.94s)]
*  You know how to overcome something that's not fun. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8996.18s)]
*  And you did it on purpose. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=8999.58s)]
*  And it'll aid you. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9001.42s)]
*  It'll aid you in other things, other things that are frustrating or, you know. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9002.86s)]
*  You're on it. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9008.1s)]
*  It's like at a time where we can look at our phone and be distracted and feel good [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9008.66s)]
*  whenever we want. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9012.26s)]
*  At a time where we can get a nice cozy feeling of distraction whenever we want. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9013.380000000001s)]
*  We're forcing ourselves to do things that are inconvenient. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9016.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9019.78s)]
*  That make us suffer. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9021.06s)]
*  And it's very important. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9022.9s)]
*  Through that suffering, we find. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9024.14s)]
*  I think it's very important. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9025.66s)]
*  Some happiness. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9027.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9028.1s)]
*  I think it helps. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9029.06s)]
*  I think your body is designed to overcome a certain amount of anxiety and stress [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9030.82s)]
*  and adversity and challenges and fear. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9038.86s)]
*  And if you don't burn that out, I think that's why so many people are on medications. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9042.42s)]
*  I think they think they need medication to get through life. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9047.980000000001s)]
*  And I think you need life to get through medication. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9050.78s)]
*  That's what I think. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9053.7s)]
*  You're more resilient than you realize. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9054.5s)]
*  Yeah, way more. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9056.380000000001s)]
*  Everybody is. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9057.26s)]
*  That's what sports does. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9058.66s)]
*  Yes. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9059.86s)]
*  Yeah, you need to test your resilience. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9060.82s)]
*  Think about this thing that we talked about with this with Randall Carlson and Graham [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9062.26s)]
*  Hancock's theory about the comet impacts from 12,000 years ago. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9066.02s)]
*  Modern civilization, as people talk about it today, started the way we talk about it [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9071.5s)]
*  today in conventional academic circles, they say it started 6,000 years ago. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9079.5s)]
*  That means that if Graham is right and Randall is right and their theory is right, that means [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9085.7s)]
*  that people lived in utter barbarism for 6,000 years before they started to reinvent agriculture [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9091.58s)]
*  and mathematics. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9102.26s)]
*  For 6,000 years, they probably slayed each other with sticks and rocks. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9105.539999999999s)]
*  Seems seems hard to believe, no? [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9111.86s)]
*  Not really. [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9113.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9114.82s)]
*  Not at all. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9115.3s)]
*  Oh, you think it is? [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9115.98s)]
*  I think it's I think that is what happened. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9116.94s)]
*  I think it's certain places I think that happened. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9119.66s)]
*  I think in other places, there was remnants of the ancient technology. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9122.14s)]
*  And I think they lived in different ways. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9126.74s)]
*  Perhaps. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9128.5s)]
*  Perhaps, but it's not a lot of evidence. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9129.58s)]
*  The evidence shows that Mesopotamia, particularly Sumer, that seems to be the oldest shit that [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9131.58s)]
*  we can find in terms of like until these Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock type theories came [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9138.58s)]
*  along, nobody entertained the thought of like the pyramids being older or the Sphinx [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9145.82s)]
*  being older. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9151.42s)]
*  Like it wasn't until like the 1990s that people start talking about that. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9152.42s)]
*  They've always just like assumed the timeline was accurate. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9157.539999999999s)]
*  And that timeline was like 6,000 years ago. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9160.58s)]
*  Ancient Sumer, it's the first mathematics, the first written language. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9164.22s)]
*  It's like a version of some of the stories from the biblical flood. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9170.1s)]
*  You know, the epic of Gilgamesh, which comes from this ancient Sumerian culture, very similar [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9175.18s)]
*  to Noah's Ark. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9180.5s)]
*  A little bit. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9181.78s)]
*  Very similar. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9183.060000000001s)]
*  But you find these similar stories everywhere. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9184.060000000001s)]
*  Because it happened. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9185.060000000001s)]
*  And it happened in different places because it was a common thing. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9187.300000000001s)]
*  Flood was common. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9190.94s)]
*  Cataclysm was maybe common. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9192.54s)]
*  Not just that, but instantaneous flooding and cataclysm that comes from meteors slamming [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9194.220000000001s)]
*  into the fucking ice caps. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9199.980000000001s)]
*  Or think about how they would react to a hurricane. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9202.18s)]
*  I mean, think about how simple we view a hurricane and what that does. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9204.74s)]
*  Or tornado. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9209.460000000001s)]
*  The damage that does to a city. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9210.460000000001s)]
*  Now, that's a city that has like buildings made of concrete and stone. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9211.460000000001s)]
*  Imagine tents, right? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9215.26s)]
*  Imagine people living more or less outside. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9217.42s)]
*  The devastation that that would cause. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9219.220000000001s)]
*  What's the part of the world that has the most hurricanes? [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9221.34s)]
*  Caribbean? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9225.14s)]
*  Is it Caribbean? [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9226.14s)]
*  I would assume. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9227.14s)]
*  I would assume the Caribbean. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9228.14s)]
*  Makes sense, right? [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9230.1s)]
*  Like the Atlantic is a warmer water. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9231.1s)]
*  Come up from Africa, crossover. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9234.58s)]
*  And then they hit the Caribbean. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9237.140000000001s)]
*  And I don't know. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9239.18s)]
*  I wonder if you could tie cultural attributes to cataclysm. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9241.1s)]
*  You go to the Caribbean and there's this incredible love and kindness and support. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9248.98s)]
*  Latin culture that you feel. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9254.5s)]
*  And it's just like, yeah, maybe we should focus on that shit. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9255.98s)]
*  Maybe we should help each other out. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9258.92s)]
*  Maybe we don't need to build a skyscraper. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9260.5s)]
*  Maybe we need to dance today. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9261.5s)]
*  Because the fucking sky gods might come down and wipe out your whole village. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9264.66s)]
*  Japan is actually number one on that list. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9268.46s)]
*  Countries most exposed to tropical cyclones worldwide in 2022. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9270.9s)]
*  Like it makes sense that like up in... [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9274.619999999999s)]
*  Wow, Japan's number one. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9276.38s)]
*  In the Philippines. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9277.66s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, the cyclones and shit. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9278.66s)]
*  Then the Bahamas and then South Korea. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9280.939999999999s)]
*  And Tigua and Barbuda. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9284.14s)]
*  Is Barbuda Barbados? [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9286.939999999999s)]
*  No, different place. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9287.939999999999s)]
*  I don't think so, yeah. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9288.939999999999s)]
*  China, Cuba, of course Cuba, right? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9290.42s)]
*  Dominican Republic, Cuba. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9293.220000000001s)]
*  Vietnam, Mexico, Dominica. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9294.220000000001s)]
*  And Mexico, of course, I imagine on that side. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9295.220000000001s)]
*  Florida, not even on the list. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9298.220000000001s)]
*  They don't even touch it. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9299.220000000001s)]
*  But yeah, that's the beauty. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9300.220000000001s)]
*  Now what about tornadoes? [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9301.220000000001s)]
*  Is that like exclusively an American problem? [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9304.220000000001s)]
*  Well, I would want to know how the natives spoke about tornadoes. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9307.220000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9311.220000000001s)]

*  bomb and had only advanced to preliminary research. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9659.98s)]
*  How far away do you think it came from us going from preliminary research to the Manhattan [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9664.619999999999s)]
*  Project? [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9669.98s)]
*  Like how long was that? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9670.98s)]
*  Thank God they didn't do it though. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9672.46s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9675.18s)]
*  What is that shit right there? [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9676.18s)]
*  Oh isn't that dope? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9677.18s)]
*  That's a Japanese artist made it for me. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9678.18s)]
*  Isn't that sick? [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9681.5s)]
*  Bro, the Japanese are awesome shit bro. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9682.5s)]
*  Definitely. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9685.5s)]
*  We need to look into the Japanese. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9686.5s)]
*  You know that's the only people that the Mongols didn't take over. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9687.5s)]
*  And why? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9690.78s)]
*  Because the Samurais fucked them up. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9691.78s)]
*  The Mongols showed up and they tried to take over Japan on several occasions, more than [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9693.26s)]
*  one occasion. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9697.42s)]
*  And every time they were met with these fucking dudes who actually knew how to fight and were [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9698.54s)]
*  sword trained, they were shooting arrows at distances and they're like, whoa, what the [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9702.18s)]
*  fuck is going on here? [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9705.900000000001s)]
*  If you think about Samurais. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9709.02s)]
*  What the fuck was a Samurai? [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9711.380000000001s)]
*  Japan was the origins of karate, judo, jujitsu, all that shit came out of Japan. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9713.58s)]
*  But we're talking about feudal Japan? [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9720.58s)]
*  Like we're talking about kingdoms and such? [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9722.18s)]
*  Those cyclones saved us. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9723.7s)]
*  The Japanese have always attributed their victory to storms and that wrecked the Mongols [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9724.7s)]
*  fleets during both attempted invasions in 1274 and 1281. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9728.62s)]
*  They included that Japan was protected from invasion by a divine wind or kamikaze, which [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9736.18s)]
*  was invoked in World War II to inspire pirates, pilots to launch suicide attacks on allied [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9742.94s)]
*  ships. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9749.300000000001s)]
*  So it could be storms, but also they fought. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9750.300000000001s)]
*  They definitely had hand to hand combat. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9753.14s)]
*  And a Samurai was like, what is the equivalent of that today? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9756.34s)]
*  Is that like a, is that a military dude or is that like a street dude? [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9759.9s)]
*  I mean, eventually they became Ronins. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9763.14s)]
*  There was like a period of time during Musashi's era where they were mostly like Samurais without [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9765.74s)]
*  a master and they would have like one-on-one duels. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9771.9s)]
*  That's like the book of five rings is based on Miyamoto Musashi's writings about another [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9776.539999999999s)]
*  book. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9782.539999999999s)]
*  Well, the greatest book of strategy and like it was a guy who killed 62 men, at least 60, [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9783.539999999999s)]
*  60 men in one-on-one armed like, like sword fights. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9790.26s)]
*  Because you could come up to someone and just be like, it's hard. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9795.62s)]
*  They would make duels. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9797.42s)]
*  They would decide to have duels. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9798.62s)]
*  And that's to the death. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9800.660000000002s)]
*  To the death with swords. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9802.460000000001s)]
*  And Musashi killed everybody. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9804.740000000002s)]
*  He was that dude. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9807.1s)]
*  And he became the boogeyman. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9808.1s)]
*  Yeah, he became the boogeyman. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9809.1s)]
*  But his philosophy was that to be a great swordsman, you had to be good at calligraphy. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9811.94s)]
*  You had to be good at poetry. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9818.740000000002s)]
*  You had to be able to make art. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9819.740000000002s)]
*  Bro, imagine the dude that killed your dad was a poet. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9822.62s)]
*  Imagine, imagine, imagine your dad died and then the next day he's like, flowers are green, [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9825.62s)]
*  flowers are blue. [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9834.5s)]
*  I don't think, we're talking about like haikus. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9837.22s)]
*  I think we're talking about different kinds of poetry. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9839.7s)]
*  But he's trying to be well-rounded, I guess. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9842.74s)]
*  100%. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9844.74s)]
*  Yeah, that any holes in your game, any like fake shit will expose itself in one-on-one [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9845.74s)]
*  combat. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9850.5s)]
*  Like John Jones would be the modern-day version of the elite samurai. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9852.5s)]
*  Well, I mean. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9859.26s)]
*  Like are we looking at these guys, like these UFC dudes, are we like, oh this is the modern-day [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9861.26s)]
*  version of it. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9866.14s)]
*  We just have a structure for them to operate in. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9867.3s)]
*  It's sort of like that, but it's actually probably more satisfying to the fighter because [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9870.26s)]
*  you're a modern-day version in a thing where you're not going to get killed. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9876.06s)]
*  But you could get killed, right? [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9881.54s)]
*  There is that reality. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9883.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9884.42s)]
*  Most likely you won't. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9885.42s)]
*  They have very good medical staff. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9886.42s)]
*  But there's also that you are competing with your willpower, your technique, your knowledge, [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9888.42s)]
*  your fucking physical gifts, and you're doing it for the world. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9899.7s)]
*  And the rewards, like if you want to be John Jones, like good luck, it's a lot of work. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9905.54s)]
*  But if you get to be John Jones, like wow. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9910.539999999999s)]
*  Imagine that feeling. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9912.779999999999s)]
*  Imagine that feeling of strangling Cyril Gaunt like a minute into the fight and everybody [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9914.46s)]
*  being like, wow, he's the goat. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9920.66s)]
*  The baddest man on the planet. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9923.5s)]
*  He's the goat. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9924.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no one thinks like Tyson Fury could beat John Jones in a fight. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9925.779999999999s)]
*  Isn't that fucking interesting? [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9928.98s)]
*  No one thinks that. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9930.3s)]
*  Tyson doesn't think that. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9931.779999999999s)]
*  You want to talk about who's the baddest man on the planet? [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9932.779999999999s)]
*  If John Jones and Tyson Fury are locked into a room. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9935.34s)]
*  Game over. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9938.14s)]
*  I'm pushing all my chips on black. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9939.3s)]
*  I'm just fucking. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9941.58s)]
*  I'm going to tell you something. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9942.58s)]
*  Tyson Fury is an amazing boxer. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9945.58s)]
*  He doesn't have a fucking chance in hell of making it out of that room. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9950.06s)]
*  He has no chance of making it out of that room. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9953.06s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9955.66s)]
*  Zero chance. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9956.66s)]
*  So if you. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9957.66s)]
*  He would have to like catch John. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9958.66s)]
*  He had to catch him immediately. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9960.18s)]
*  Immediately with one punch. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9962.699999999999s)]
*  And I just don't see that happening, man. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9964.26s)]
*  The threat of the takedown looms so large that shot will come so unexpectedly. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9967.74s)]
*  When he gets his hands around you, you'll be so stunned. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9974.18s)]
*  So what is that like being John? [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9977.46s)]
*  Like, what is that like thinking there isn't another man on the planet that could do anything [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=9979.26s)]

*  But don't you think it's like they had to be raised in a culture where competition was [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10038.82s)]
*  valued? [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10042.26s)]

*  He's been turning that fucking bat over nonstop trying to figure it out. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10081.1s)]
*  That's what you need. [[02:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10084.54s)]
*  Right. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10085.54s)]

*  And sucking at something is uncomfortable. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10092.380000000001s)]
*  And the only way you get better at something is like realize that as good as you think [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10094.86s)]
*  you are at it, there's other levels. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10100.26s)]

*  you're just different. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10107.78s)]
*  No, you don't know shit until you actually do it. [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10109.46s)]
*  Then you strike out. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10112.539999999999s)]
*  You feel like a loser. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10113.539999999999s)]

*  It's like you're chasing some sort of adulation excitement of excellence, but also you're killing [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10118.539999999999s)]
*  your ego because your ego is the only thing that's going to fuck you up. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10125.3s)]
*  Your ego is going to lie to you, lie to you about how good you are about something. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10129.099999999999s)]
*  Think about you instead of think about the task. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10133.84s)]
*  You're going to allocate resources to deal with this childless bullshit while you really [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10136.42s)]
*  should have been thinking about the thing you're doing like in the zone. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10140.94s)]
*  Like what keeps you from doing that? [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10143.82s)]
*  Fear, fear of people ridiculing you, fear of failure, fear of that. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10145.38s)]
*  It's all ego, all of it. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10149.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10151.3s)]
*  It's almost like you need enough ego to try. [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10152.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10154.58s)]
*  That's it. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10155.58s)]
*  Not too much. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10156.58s)]
*  And then you just need strength after that. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10157.58s)]
*  You need to substitute the ego for willpower. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10159.86s)]
*  Just resilience, sheer resilience. [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10162.38s)]
*  But then again, ego sometimes causes people to do amazing shit. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10164.98s)]
*  You need some people with some fucking ego. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZ-qJ92y2I&t=10169.539999999999s)]
