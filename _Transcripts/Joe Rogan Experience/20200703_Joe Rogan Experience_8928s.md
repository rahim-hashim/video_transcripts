# Joe Rogan Experience #1502 - Russell Peters
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [July 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNvjRzcfcx0)
*  Russell! Joseph! My man! Oh we're live! We're live, we're sort of live. Salute brother.
*  Always good to see you my friend. You too, thanks. It's been a while. Midday
*  drinking, I like it. Sometimes you need it. I had a steak for breakfast. I saw you
*  post something about that. Yeah, I was like, fuck it, I don't want to eat
*  breakfast food today. I want to eat a steak. What kind of steak? I got it from Evan
*  Funke, who's the head chef of Felix, and they were preparing to reopen. Felix is
*  favorite restaurant in Venice. Have you ever been? No, I've not. Phenomenal. Brian
*  Callan turned me on to it. Okay. And they came in, him and the owner, Janet, came in
*  to do a podcast and they gave me some steaks. So I cooked one of them today.
*  What kind of cut was it? It was a T-bone, fat, big thick T-bone. They were about to reopen and now they
*  got shut down again. Do they not have a patio they can open? I don't believe they do and I
*  don't even think you're allowed to do that now. No, I think you're allowed to
*  patio still. You're just not allowed to eat indoors as far as I go.
*  I went to the deli by my house yesterday and I went, can I sit inside?
*  They're like, no, it's not allowed anymore. I go, oh, so I had to sit on the patio, but it was fine.
*  They were gonna do something at the comedy store where they were gonna serve
*  chicken fingers and just food and allow people to drink. Yes. And just start
*  opening it as a restaurant only. Yeah, I saw that and I guess it's not happening.
*  No, they shut it down because right when they were about to do it then LA shut
*  down the restaurants. It's so shitty. Well, it's real shitty, man. It's real
*  shitty and what's extra shitty about it is they were almost out of the woods.
*  They were right about to reopen again because the uptick. Yeah, California
*  spiked harder than everyone else almost. Yeah, a lot of protesters. And then Florida.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of protesting. Yeah. People want to pretend it's not the protesting.
*  I'm 100% for the protesting. Don't get me wrong, but I'm also 100% for freedom.
*  America, I'll tell you what, boy. Yeah, I mean, look, it's just natural, man. You get a
*  few sick people and you get 10,000 people, 50,000 people huddled together.
*  People are gonna get sick. Yeah, and they're that close yelling at each other.
*  You know, yelling literally screaming so it spits flying. Apparently, particularly
*  at night times when it spreads because Brett Weinstein, who's a biologist who's
*  on the podcast, I saw that sent me a paper that said that there's a recent
*  study that shows that COVID-19 dies almost instantly when it hits sunlight.
*  Yeah, that's why it's ridiculous. They close the beaches. Yeah, that's where you
*  should want everybody. Right. Just stay away from each other. Just stay out in the
*  sun. Killing COVID. Right. Wear your mask when you're getting up and leaving.
*  And then when you're sitting down, stay away from everybody and everybody is fine.
*  It's not rocket science. The problem is that people are not gonna listen.
*  Yeah, but I mean, still, I mean, fucking you got a much better chance of it dying
*  out there by the beach. Yes. And you know, Fourth of July weekend, they did it.
*  It's only gonna rile people up further. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's I mean, I'm really
*  worried about the state. I really am. It's the state of California or the state
*  of the country? Well, the state of the country for sure. But California in
*  particular, because so many cases and then the homeless population. Have you
*  ever been you've been by Brentwood lately? Are they have they moved them
*  all there now? They got a fucking tent village set up there. Jimmy, see if you
*  can find photos of that. They used to have them under the bridges here in the
*  valley. My friend Matt was talking about he works down there and he was telling
*  me how insane it is. He's like, they're never gonna leave this. They're like
*  they have it set up now or they have like a community. Yeah. And then you have
*  to stay socially distant inside the tent community and a bunch of people don't
*  want to follow the rules. So they're outside the tent community. So you have
*  fences. So you have the people inside the tent community that are set up with,
*  you know, six foot distance. So it's basically an HOA under the bridge. Yeah.
*  Well, it's on under the bridge. They're using the veterans something or another.
*  The V. A. They have some some large yard. Right. And then outside of the fence,
*  they have the people that are rule breakers. So they set up their tents just
*  outside. They're like, Fuck you, pussies. We're over here making out like they
*  don't want to have any rules. So they don't want to deal with the socially
*  distant. If you're inside the tents that they've set up and created for you, you
*  have to follow the rules. So those are probably the ones that are following the
*  rules are probably the homeless people that just, you know, took a bad turn
*  financially. And then the other ones that are acting up, probably the drug
*  ones. L. A. Is getting a government run tent city. All it took was 40 years and
*  a pandemic. But they're saying that like it's a good thing. Yeah, like we're
*  finally. Yeah, that's what they're saying. But you know, this is gonna first
*  of all, this is gonna crush property values. This is this is in Brentwood, not
*  the property values are the most important thing. Don't get me wrong, but
*  they're an important thing, especially in that neighborhood. Yeah, that's a very
*  valuable neighborhood. And if someone has invested all their money into their
*  home and they're hoping to sell their home and then all of a sudden the home
*  values drop radically because nobody wants to live right next door to a tent
*  city. See if there's any photos of that fucking thing because the photos are
*  pretty dramatic. Maybe they're trying to hide it because they're trying to make
*  it. You know, that's one of the things, man. Everybody's sugar coating everything
*  on here. They're sugar coating and then there's and then there's the fucking
*  over reactors. It's a very insane time. Yeah, you know why people over react,
*  though. It's because it's not the same for everybody. Like I have a friend who
*  got covid. He's 37. He was clear of it in three days and three days. He felt like
*  shit. He couldn't smell. It couldn't taste three days late. He was on Z pack
*  and something else and just stayed home and he got vitamin I V s every day. And
*  then three days later, he's going on a 25 mile bike ride three days, three
*  days. He's fine. I don't know if it's a good idea to go on that bike ride by
*  the way. Yeah, but I want to see what happens. I'm not saying anything. Hope
*  wears a mask. Yeah, I want to see if it makes him feel like shit. If he goes on
*  the bike ride or if he feels great. I was talking to DL because you know, he
*  just got yeah, I saw that was really scary and he was like, no, I got nothing.
*  He's fine. Yeah, I haven't. He said I felt nothing the entire time. Well, he
*  coughed a little today. He had a video, a little bit of video. He was hilarious.
*  He's like, Oh, my culvis is acted out. Yeah, yeah, I saw that because he
*  probably smoked a joint right before that. Probably right. But it was scary
*  watching him just slump into unconsciousness on stage and whoever that
*  guy is that caught him. That guy's a fucking hero. That's his road manager. I
*  think his road manager is a fucking hero because if DL fell, he would have
*  smashed his head on that stage and you got real problems then. Yeah, because he
*  was just sitting there and he he slurred his words and the audience was like,
*  What the fuck did you just say? Like they couldn't understand what he said. You
*  saw the video. I did not see the video. Let's see if we can find it. It's it's I
*  only just found out there was a video of it like two nights ago because Cedric
*  was at my house. DL is a fucking great guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy.
*  I used to open for me. You know that? No, 23 years ago. He's smart as fuck. He's
*  a really smart guy, but a really good guy to. Yeah, really good guy. Really
*  honest and yeah. And I think minded. I think the a lot of the here it is right
*  here. So he's on stage and I guess his road manager fellow that right that guy
*  there gives him a drink of water. He puts the water down and he's this doesn't
*  have any volume. Unfortunately, there it goes. Here it goes.
*  You've been in quarantine so long. We came back.
*  Remember, remember, I want to give it a big skin to call it. They were immigrants.
*  Right. Everybody's like what? See now what? Hear that? What? But now watch. He
*  just slowly starts slumping. Look, that guy, that road manager is a fucking
*  hero because that guy was there. Look, his head still hit the bone. Yeah, a
*  little bit.
*  But the what I was worried was a stroke because sometimes that happens to people.
*  But first of all, the way they drag him off the fucking stage like, Hey guys,
*  when you pussies actually carry him, they didn't even let him finish his set,
*  though. They're dragging him, though, bouncing off the I know they didn't let
*  him finish. Just throw some water on. Come on. We're comics. We can get
*  through this.
*  They said, like, we have everything okay. And everything like, Yeah, right.
*  You don't have nothing under control. Yeah, nothing's under control. Joe Rogan
*  meets a crazy stripper.
*  The the real scary thing was the slurring of the words. Yeah, because he
*  was at my house about a less than a month before that happened. One night on
*  May 30th. I had them over with cigars in the backyard, socially distancing. Of
*  course, you know, it was me, Cedric, DL, J. Phillips, Dwayne Martin. And we're
*  just hanging out and have a drink. You like cigars? You want a cigar right now?
*  Midday cigar. Fuck it. Let's go.
*  I'll do a midday cigar and a little midday bourbon. Mike Binder gave me these.
*  He came over when he's doing that. Oh, in the documentary. Nice. I like Mike. He's a
*  good guy. He's a good guy. The documentary looks really good, man. Yeah,
*  I went into the store and did it. Oh, did you? Yeah, that's probably the best
*  place for it. Yeah, it's good because it gives the energy of the room, you know?
*  Yeah, he wanted to do it here, though. He wanted to get he and I talking about it.
*  Take that. Take that. Take that. Take that. This is an interesting one. Look at
*  that. This is from Benchmade Knives. You get the coolest shit sent to you.
*  Look at that. Like a guillotine. It's my move. It's my move. Is that your move?
*  That's my move now. Really? It's a good move. You know, because of you, my other
*  move is the in-arm choke. Head and arm choke? Yeah. And so whenever I get it,
*  I get in position for it, Sean Jacoby, Joe Hogan choke. The Joe Hogan choke.
*  That's hilarious. Yeah, that choke fucked my neck up. I was using my neck so much
*  to squeeze against dude's arms. Oh, because you flatten out and do that?
*  Yeah, but you're actually using your arm, excuse me, your neck rather to hold
*  someone's arm into place.
*  So it's nice to hear that you've been training, man. Yeah, it's nice to have been
*  training. Is it legal now? They're gonna arrest you for training? What happens?
*  It became legal and then I don't know if it's still legal, but I was doing it
*  with Jays of Bellows and Mark Armstrong, whom you both know, I would imagine.
*  Oh yeah, Jays great. Jays used to run the Malibu place. I was going over there
*  for a while. It was a really easy drive.
*  Yeah, so he's a super nice guy too. Really slick on the ground too. Yes.
*  Oh yeah, really high level black belt. Yeah, and
*  real technical too. Those guys that teach, there's something to be said about
*  teaching. I often wondered whether or not that would actually translate to comedy
*  as well, because teaching martial arts makes you way better at it. When I got
*  really good at taekwondo, one of the ways I got really good was I was teaching
*  all the time. And there's something about that teaching all the time. Because you end up
*  breaking it down. Yes, yeah. My friend Brent, he was one of Eddie Bravo's teachers,
*  one of his instructors. And when I first started rolling with him, we were both
*  like purple belts together. And then he started teaching. He quit his job and
*  started teaching. And when he started teaching, he jumped up like huge. Like
*  he had made this... Like before we used to... I don't remember how we used to go,
*  but it was close. But then once he started teaching, man, he became fucking
*  super dangerous, man. I remember it was like a way harder role. I was like,
*  holy shit, man, this is amazing. And it was really just for teaching.
*  My game changed training with Mark and Jay every day for like a month and a half.
*  Like my game completely changed from... I used to just... You rolled with me last
*  year, so... And I always tell people what a fucking gorilla you are. People,
*  I feel like rolling with Joe Rogan. I go, you ever rolled with a gorilla?
*  That's what it's like rolling with a fucking gorilla.
*  Well, it's not fair. I've been doing it a long time now. No, I know. But...
*  Since 96. Yeah. So my game was always just defend. Just defend, make sure you
*  don't get got. I wasn't gonna get you, but you weren't gonna get me. Mind you,
*  you got me. But so that's what my game became after that as well. And then
*  it just changed. Something happened and I became from defensive to offensive now.
*  Yeah. Well, once you catch a few people... Yeah. The real secret is
*  drilling. And that's the thing that people don't enjoy doing. People really
*  enjoy rolling. They really enjoy sparring because it's so fun. Eddie Bravo explained
*  that to me once a long time ago. He's like, everybody loves to spar because
*  it's so fun, but they don't work enough time, spend enough time rather on
*  really developing new moves. But if you spend enough time on developing new
*  moves, then the sparring becomes so much better. But you just have to be
*  disciplined to do the drilling. Right. I do get bored doing drills. It's boring.
*  Ten this way, ten that way. But if you do it and you do it with
*  sincerity, you have to do it like almost think about it like you're actually
*  pulling it off. Because a lot of times guys go through the motions with
*  drills and they don't think of it as something that they are really doing.
*  They're just kind of like, oh yeah, this is how I do it. But they don't
*  think they're actually applying the choke. But if you could think of it as
*  like, this is really happening. I'm really passing the guard. I'm going knee
*  on belly. They buck, I take the back, I get the choke, I sink it in it,
*  they tap. And then you do it again and you do it again and you do it
*  again. And then one day you'll be sparring. And in that sparring, the
*  same thing will happen. You'll pass the guard, the person will move, you'll
*  go knee to belly, they'll go to their back, you take the choke. And it's
*  like, when that stuff happens, it's so satisfying. You can learn. I made
*  the biggest leap from blue belt to purple belt. And that was because I
*  was hanging out with Eddie and we were drilling a lot. He was maniacal about
*  it. You guys started at the same time? No, he was way ahead of me. He was
*  really good before I started. He was a really good purple belt when I first
*  met him. Maybe, yeah, like purple. Yeah, right around purple. And then when he
*  went off to, in 2003, when he went to Sao Paulo, he was a brown belt. He was
*  really good though. And then he tapped Hoyler and then when he came back,
*  Sean Jock gave him his black belt. He gave him his own black belt. He did.
*  He took it right off his back. Yeah, he tapped two world champions. He tapped
*  Gustavo Dantes in the first fight and then he tapped Hoyler Gracie. It was
*  crazy shit. And then I heard Hoyce chased him down in the parking lot or
*  something. No, that was a different time. That was a different event. That was
*  the second time he had a match up with Hoyler. But he was never
*  disrespectful to Hoyler. It's just sometimes people get things twisted and
*  then you don't see each other in real life. If you talk to Eddie Bravo about
*  Hoyce Gracie, it was never anything but respect. Hoyce is a cop now. Hoyce
*  became a cop. He's actually a cop? He's a cop in Idaho. What? Yeah, go to the
*  real Hoyce Gracie. I thought he lived in California. Well, you could shoot people
*  in Idaho. I don't know, man. I mean, he's a real... Did he not want a lot of
*  action? I don't know. He's a gun enthusiast. I follow him on Instagram.
*  There's a lot of gun stuff. And I'm like, I never really understood the
*  connection. I'm like, a lot of the fighter guys, a lot of fighter people
*  that I follow are all into guns. And I'm like, some sort of survivalist mentality,
*  our newest reserve police officer spent hours in the rain going through training
*  drills and completing the Idaho post firearms qualification. Hoyce, motherfucking
*  Gracie. That's so weird. If there's a Mount Rushmore of martial arts, there's
*  only one face that is absolutely on there. And that's that guy. There's not a
*  fucking doubt in my mind that guy's face needs to be on. And Martin Short, too,
*  in the middle, apparently.
*  They really can't be a Mount Rushmore of martial arts because there's
*  not enough heads. Even if you had a Mount Rushmore of MMA, how are you only
*  gonna have four heads? There's a lot of people that came in and changed the
*  game. Yeah, there's too many people. You have to have GSP. Have to. You have to.
*  Two division world champion dominated the welterweights, revolutionized the way
*  people think about athletes training for MMA. When he was at the peak of his
*  championship skills, he was unstoppable, man. When he beat John Fitch, when he
*  smashed BJ Penn, like those days. And then he came back after retirement and beat
*  Bisping. And beat Bisping at 85 and put him to sleep with a rear naked choke.
*  He actually was better. He actually looked better after four years out. It's
*  a long time away, too. It's not like a month off. Yeah, he's Mount Rushmore for
*  sure. Mighty Mouse has to be Mount Rushmore. You know, people forgot. You
*  forgot. But you watch those Mighty Mouse fights back when Mighty Mouse beat
*  Sahudo for the first time, when he beat, I mean, fucking the Ray Borg one when he
*  threw him to the air and caught him in an armbar on the way down. I remember
*  that. God damn, dude. That was crazy. Mighty Mouse, when he was in his peak,
*  was something really special. I have a friend of mine who trains with Mighty
*  Mouse. It's Indian kid who fights the Saint Lion. Is he fighting for one of
*  C? Yeah. Yeah. One of C is amazing. Gurudarshan. Yeah, they're they have some
*  really tough fighters over there and Mighty Mouse is still stomping them. Yeah,
*  I'm hearing that one might try and start up by by the fall out here in America.
*  Really? In America? Good luck. That's what I said. It doesn't make sense. You
*  might as well stick to Singapore. Yeah, Singapore. They're huge. Are they allowed
*  to do shows right now? I don't know, but I think the rest of the world's opening
*  up, but they're not letting Americans in. Isn't that crazy? Well, it makes sense.
*  What did we do? How did we fuck this up? It's funny because America was the one
*  that was stopping everybody from coming in. Now the rest of the world's like,
*  hey, hey, wait there for a second. What do you think it is? Is it that so many
*  Americans are overweight? Is it the protests? It's that blind entitlement. As
*  a Canadian, I could tell you this. There seems to be like a blind entitlement
*  with a lot of Americans where they, I'm American, I can do whatever I want. I'm
*  like, yeah, you can, but can you just listen to a little bit of reason for a
*  minute? Here's why this is happening. I'm like, no, you're invading my rights.
*  And I'm like, I get that. We're all frustrated with it. I'm with you on this,
*  but for the betterment of the rest of the country, if you could just wait a
*  little bit. I just wish there was an awesome treatment. So if you got it,
*  it was like, my friend who's 37, I don't want to say his name because I don't
*  think he's talked about it yet. But when he got it, he was a little bummed out at
*  first. And then two days later, he's like, this ain't shit. Three days later,
*  he was like no symptoms at all. Yeah, I did the test on Monday. I had your guy
*  come to my house. Well, he sent somebody and I was negative. I did the finger
*  one, the blood one, then the nose swab, negative on all of them. But I think I
*  had it, dude, in January and I had like a brief one. Yeah, but dude, if you had
*  it that FDA approved antibodies test that concierge MD uses, they would catch
*  it. I think that a lot of people thought they had it because there's the regular
*  flu and there's regular colds. Yeah, but I never get those either. You know what I
*  mean? But you can. That's true. You're a human. That's true. But and then a lot of
*  people, I think a lot of the testing results are getting marked wrong. You
*  think so? Yeah, it's, listen, I had a friend pass away during this whole thing.
*  From? He died of cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. And because they did a
*  COVID test, they said it's COVID related. Yeah, that's rough. And I'm like, come on,
*  that's fucking bullshit. Because I spoke to the doctor less than 24 hours before
*  he passed away. And the doctor said he's got three to six months. My doctor told
*  me that there's quite a few cases of people that were literally at death's
*  door from cardiopulmonary disease. And they got COVID and died and they called
*  a COVID death. And he was upset about it. He was like, I understand because a lot
*  of these hospitals are privately funded, privately owned. And that's something I
*  didn't really even consider. I always thought a hospital was like some sort of
*  state run thing. I mean, I never thought about hospitals. Did you? No, see, I'm
*  from again, I'm from Canada, where they're all government run. Yeah. Well,
*  they have they have to make money, you know, and basically, this guy was saying,
*  look, the doctors are doing their best. And it's not that they want to be
*  deceptive. And it's not that they're doing it anyway. But he goes, but
*  hospitals are like any other business. There's a bottom line. They have to make
*  money. And if there's an incentive for them to call something a COVID death,
*  and they receive extra funds, especially in a time like this, where they're
*  really hurting financially, it makes sense. But at all, you know, it really
*  highlights why a state funded medical, you know, some sort of a, if we had like
*  the way Canada has it, like Canada is not perfect. No, I mean, it's not listen,
*  it's not the best. But it's pretty, it's pretty efficient. You don't have to pay
*  it's efficient for what you need it to be. You need something extra done. Yeah,
*  you might have you might be better off paying a little extra to get something
*  done. But as far as like regular shit, you know, you get a cold, go to the
*  doctor, you, you break your arm, you go to the doctor. Yeah, well, I have friends
*  that have had like real problems, like shoulder problems and knee problems,
*  like they need surgery, and they've come to America to get it. Oh, yeah, no,
*  that's what that's the way it works. Same with my dad when he had cancer, he the
*  treatment he wanted or needed was in Philadelphia. Yeah. So it's like
*  privately funded stuff, stuff that costs more money, where the doctors get they
*  have an incentive to become excellent, right? Because they can make more money
*  doing it. Like specializing. Yeah. But then the Canadian government still picked
*  up the tab for it. Oh, really? Yeah, because it was a service that wasn't
*  available in Canada. That's sweet. Yeah. So they were like, All right, we got it.
*  Yeah, that's a divisive thing over here, man. And that's where I go. It is weird
*  that it's divisive, too, because it's like, it literally benefits everybody.
*  Do you know why it's divisive? Because the people that are healthy at the time
*  are arguing about it. They don't want to pay. Yeah, it's the people that are
*  healthy at the time. They're not looking at it long term. But you would think
*  that these politicians would be for two because they're all old as shit. Yeah,
*  but they have money. That's true. They've been corrupt and taking money on the
*  take. Like I'm a Bernie Sanders fan. And that's one of the things that I really
*  like about what Bernie Sanders was saying. You know, Bernie Sanders was
*  saying that it should be a fundamental right as an American citizen to have
*  health care. It should be fundamental right as a human being anywhere in the
*  world. Yes. The way I look at it, I mean, people have all these little weird
*  arguments about it. But the way I looked at it was like, aren't we a community?
*  So if we're a community, shouldn't we, if we're gonna take care of things, we
*  should take care of fire department, right? You should have a fire department,
*  tax dollars pay for that. You should have a police department, tax dollars to pay
*  for that. What about health care, education? All those things should be,
*  there should be all those things taken care of. Yeah, I don't, again, I've only
*  been here 14 years, so I'm learning about the education system now in America.
*  Well, we thought Obamacare, we thought Obamacare was gonna cover it. That's what
*  a lot of people thought. When Obama was talking about it and they were trying to
*  get the Affordable Care Act passed and get everything, we thought, oh, this is
*  gonna be it. We're gonna be cool. But it seems like, what is it, nine years later?
*  It's like 12 years later? How many years is it now? Well, he's been gone for four.
*  When did he start it, though? He started it, I think. We had an eight year term,
*  but when was he... Yeah, wasn't it in the middle of, or the beginning of a
*  second term? Is that when it started? Or the end of his first term,
*  somewhere around there? So let's just say it's seven years old. Yeah. Still,
*  it's not much difference. Is it much different, Jamie? Do you know?
*  I'm talking about, what part of it is different? He's spacing out. I mean,
*  is it easier to get health care? Is it better? It was. Some people got it
*  taken away from him already. Because of Trump? Yeah. That motherfucker. And then
*  there was also the people that were against the Obamacare because they said
*  it made their rates go up. Yeah. Yeah, there was that too. Yeah,
*  there was a bunch of people that were doctors that were upset about it.
*  They were saying it was too expensive for them. There's just so much fucking
*  red tape and everything nowadays. It's so hard to be a person. It's like being
*  on a movie set, you know? Hey, can I get a bottle of water?
*  Can somebody get a talent, a bottle of water? Sure. Don't plug that in,
*  whatever you do. Yeah, right? You plug something in, the union electric guys.
*  Yeah, fuck dude. It's so crazy. I did a movie last summer and
*  I became friends with all the drivers because they were all Teamster guys and
*  they were all Italian. And I just break their balls when we're driving back and
*  forth. So they fucking love me. It's like lunchtime would come and they'd be
*  like, hey Russell, Mikey C says don't go to lunch. He got you a sandwich from
*  our spot. And I'm like, oh, thanks Mikey C.
*  Nice. They were good guys. There's something to be said for Teamsters.
*  Yeah, it's... We got a lot of people, man. I think that's part of the problem.
*  Yeah. Part of the problem in this country. We got a lot of people.
*  If we're... Humans are designed to live in little villages, I think. I think when
*  you get us into these big large groups of people, shit gets weird. Yeah,
*  well everybody wants to establish their dominance. There's a little bit of that
*  too. Yeah. And there's a bunch of different ways to live. Everybody wants
*  to establish that their way is the best way. You gotta do it our way. Yeah,
*  there's... And there's no one way. There's no one way. Fucking Eddie.
*  Are you doing any shows right now? I did. I did Miami this past weekend.
*  What'd you do? Five shows. The improv? Yeah. Wow. So that was the first time
*  in three months? No. Two weeks before that I did the American Comedy Club
*  in San Diego. That was the first time. They're open for that long? Yeah.
*  So that was good. It was like 75 people a show. The whole comedy store's open
*  again. Already? Yeah. Yeah. It was good though. I had a good time.
*  And then Miami, I was getting a little leery of the numbers and the stats
*  coming out, so I would literally stay in my hotel room until show time,
*  go to the show, do my shows, no meet and greet and bounce right back
*  to the hotel. Will you do anything to take precautions? Are you taking supplements?
*  Yeah, I'm on a bunch of shit. I got this anti-aging doctor that
*  I see. Will you taking vitamins though? Yeah, I'm taking a bunch of vitamin D.
*  A bunch of vitamin D, some stupid amount, like 20,000 or something like that.
*  Really? Every day? A vitamin D? Yeah. Or maybe 10,000 a day. I take 5,000.
*  5,000 I use every day. Yeah, I take two 5,000, so yeah. Damn,
*  look at you. I'm getting the D. Hey, wait a minute. What a hee.
*  It's hard and you can't go outside. That's one of the really rough things,
*  right? The best way to get vitamin D is really from the sun. Yeah,
*  it was 15 minutes at a time or something, but I get dark as fuck when I go
*  outside. And I got this stupid sun spot right here that I'm always paranoid
*  about. Oh, does it get darker when you get tanned? Yeah, it gets hyperpigmentation.
*  Tried lasering it off a few times, but again, in California,
*  it's difficult when I go to these places, they need a special laser for brown
*  skin. Oh, really? I'm like, you're taking a brown spot off. How difficult can
*  this be? What is it from? It's just a birth thing? No,
*  it just developed over the years. It was a tiny light spot,
*  looked like a splash. But it's nothing dangerous. No. And then it just,
*  you know, just hyperpigmentation. As you get older, your skin gets weaker,
*  I imagine. Yeah, a lot of folks get those weird little black, like Morgan Freeman's
*  got those weird little black spots that stick out of his face. Yeah,
*  it looks like he's got black sesames all over him. It's strange, right? Yeah.
*  What is that? I don't know. Again, I think I'm getting them somewhere on my
*  neck. I've got one of those now. On him, it kind of looks better,
*  though. Gives him that distinguished, distinguished speckled look. Yeah,
*  that guy could do no wrong. Has he ever been in a bad movie?
*  What's a bad Morgan Freeman movie? What is a bad Morgan Freeman? I don't think
*  he's... He's like one of those guys, if he's in a movie, I'm comforted.
*  You know? I'm like, all right. It's gonna be a good movie. He will drive
*  Miss Daisy. Yeah. And he'll do it with class. He's got great hair,
*  you know? You know what I said? He's got a solid head of hair and a great
*  voice. He's like our generation's James Earl Jones. Not that our generation
*  didn't have an James Earl Jones, but he's like our second backup James Earl
*  Jones. That's interesting. You see they're doing a Jack Johnson movie?
*  Are they really? Yeah. Who's playing Jack Johnson? Mahershali. I don't know
*  that dude. Yeah, the guy from the Green Book, the black dude. Oh, yeah. Really?
*  Wow. Does he know how to box? I don't know. Apparently he did... I think he
*  did a Broadway version of Jack Johnson or something in 2000. Oh, no shit.
*  See if you can find some... That's crazy. That was 20 years ago.
*  2000 is 20 years ago. Does that seem right? He seems so slight though.
*  Like he doesn't seem like a big dude, but he looks a lot like him there.
*  There he is. Yeah. But Jack Johnson had those giant 13 inch wrists.
*  Did he really? Yeah, he has a massive wrist. I didn't know that.
*  Massive wrists, huh? Yeah. Wow. Unruly. Hold on, go back up. It says HBO
*  Limited Series. Oh, it's a series. Interesting. That's my favorite fighter of
*  all time, Jack Johnson. Well, you wanna talk about a brave man.
*  I mean, that guy was knocking out white people at the turn of the 20th century.
*  And he would punish them. Yes. He wouldn't just knock you out,
*  because he knew he could knock you out. Right. He would hit you in the
*  jaw, see your knees buck, and step in and hold you up. And he would say shit
*  to you. Not yet, boss. Not yet. You're gonna have a long night tonight,
*  boss. Just beat the shit out of him. He would hurt him and just hold him
*  up. No, no, don't fall down. I want you to take this beating.
*  That to me is like the ultimate fucking gangster move. I have one of those
*  Roots of Fight shirts with him, and it says the Galveston Giant. But when
*  you look up how big he was, he wasn't very big. He was like 5'9 or 5'10.
*  No, no, no, no. I think he was more than 6' tall. But back then,
*  he was a giant. Yeah. But because his wrists, he had big, he had thick,
*  he was a thick dude. I think he was only like 200 plus pounds,
*  like a little... Yeah, he wasn't over, he wasn't much over 200.
*  No. Yeah. People just didn't have any food back then. No, he was dense
*  though, like his body was fucking... The story's about him, right?
*  There it is. Look at him. 6' tall, 200 pounds, and he was a giant back then.
*  Isn't that crazy? The Galveston Giant. His fucking forearms are bigger
*  than his biceps almost. Damn, he did have some giant ass forearms. Yeah.
*  He fought middleweight Stanley Ketchell. Stanley Ketchell, yeah. In an exhibition
*  bout. And Ketchell tried to knock him out and dropped him. Yeah,
*  and that's when he got right up and then knocked him out and his teeth
*  got embedded into his glove. Yeah. Well, back then when they had gloves,
*  their gloves were like bag gloves. They were tiny ass little gloves with
*  horse hair in them. Oh, yeah. And you could pack the horse hair down,
*  and guys would squirt water into their... They'd make a small incision,
*  squirt water into their gloves and pack the horse hair down to make it
*  hard. Yeah. It's a... Rough way to live back then, bro. Have you ever felt those
*  gloves and the leather's really coarse? Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a rough way
*  to live, man. Little Arthur. That's what they call him too, right?
*  Is that what they call him? Little Arthur? He had a bunch of nicknames.
*  Little Arthur... Imagine if you take a guy like that and train him today.
*  You know what I mean? Just the character that you would have to have
*  to be the heavyweight champ in the world when... I mean, racism back then
*  was probably magnified by a hundred fold, right? He would fight 45 round
*  fights and shit like that. Oh, they all would have those. 60 round fights.
*  Yeah. Him and Sam Langford and Peter Jackson and all those guys.
*  But he wouldn't give Langford a title shot. Why? I don't know.
*  There's something with that. I don't know what that was about,
*  but... Car accident claims Jack Johnson in 1946. That's when he died. Wow.
*  Because he liked fast cars. Oh, yeah. And he would always...
*  There's that famous story of him getting pulled over by a cop.
*  Yep. Gave him a hundred bucks. Yeah, I told him I'm going the same
*  speed on the way back. Yeah. And then there was the other one where
*  he... Apparently, he got into a taxi one time and the guy said,
*  I don't drive the N words. And so Jack grabbed him, threw him in the
*  back seat, got in the front, drove him to where he had to get to.
*  Wow. And then the guy's like, hey, what about my
*  fare? He goes, I drove myself. And look at the... He had white wives
*  back then too. Oh, yeah. He did that on purpose. Imagine those chicks,
*  how bold you had to be back then. He was probably hung like a
*  horse too. Oh, yeah. Like multiple horses.
*  I would love to see what the world was like at various stages in history.
*  I wonder if one day they're going to be able to do that with virtual
*  reality. I don't know if you've ever used any of those Oculus Rift
*  headsets or anything like that. They're really interesting. They got one
*  now with Alex Honnold, who's that crazy free solo climber. Right. And
*  he went up the side of a mountain with this camera apparatus on. So
*  you're literally looking at this climb from his perspective. It's fucking
*  bonkers. But I wonder if they're going to get to a point, I would love it
*  if they got to a point where you could go back in time. You could go
*  to 1920s New York City and see what it looked like.
*  Hear it and see it. There's videos on YouTube about what the world was
*  like. If you can go back 10 million years, this is what it looked like.
*  And then they do this and what the world would look like in this many
*  years. That's all speculation, but I guess the ones going back are more
*  confirmed, so to speak. I just would love to... You're never going to
*  really be able to go there, but I think they're going to be able to
*  simulate it in a way that's really, really close within our lifetime.
*  Yeah, they're on it. They're on it, especially now. They got nothing
*  else to do. They might as well work extra hard on it. I just think
*  it would be amazing just to get a glimpse of what it was like,
*  like 1700s Paris, walking down the street in the 1700s,
*  as they can recreate it perfectly. Yeah, and while they're building
*  something that's like... You could be there when they're building the
*  Colosseum or something in Rome. Yeah, they don't know how they did
*  that though. That's the problem. If you want to go back to the
*  Parthenon or something like that, how did they erect these? Yeah. Who
*  were the crafts people? Yeah, because that's the thing. There's a lot
*  of... Again, that always changes too. That's the beauty of science,
*  that there's never really the answer. There's what they think the
*  answer is, and then when they find out the answer, like,
*  oh, we were wrong the first time. Yeah. Do you think you're gonna stay
*  in America no matter what? You're thinking about going back to Toronto?
*  I know you love it up there. I love my home, but I got two kids
*  here. Yeah. I can't just leave. Right. What are they gonna do?
*  I'm not gonna bring two baby mamas with me. That's not the way that's
*  gonna go. Good luck. Yeah, so... You know what? I gotta lay in the
*  bed that I made, buddy. Or start a reality show. Two baby mamas in
*  Toronto. That's the name of the show. Yeah, right. Two Americans in
*  Toronto. Two baby mamas and Russell Peters in Toronto. I gotta buy
*  three houses? Fuck that. No, you don't. You buy one big house,
*  and that's how you film it. Yeah. You have the East West. Yeah,
*  I'll take the center. You guys are Easton List. Yeah, you have division.
*  I'm the referee. I walk around with a footlocker shirt on all day.
*  Yeah, you all meet in the middle. You set up a gymnasium for the
*  kids in the middle. Everything's fun. The game's in the middle. Girls
*  can talk shit to each other. Oh, yeah. No, that's no good. That's
*  no good. I don't want that to be my life. It's already my life.
*  I don't want it to be any further my life. Well, you gotta think,
*  what are comedians gonna do if it gets to a point where there really
*  is no more income from stand up anymore? I mean, I'm legitimately
*  concerned that this is gonna last a lot longer than people think.
*  I'm definitely concerned. Yeah. I mean, you know, this thing kicked me
*  in the nuts pretty good, this whole thing. And there's a reason I'm out
*  there doing dates, you know, putting it on the line just because I have
*  to. Yeah. You know? Well, you your income is solely from stand up.
*  Solely. And we all thought that was fun. Yeah. Everybody. I mean,
*  if this didn't happen, I wouldn't even be in any kind of situation.
*  Right. Yeah. Like that. Everything's good. Yeah, man. But it there's
*  only certain people who really blossomed in this and you're one of
*  well, Schultz. Sure. Andrew Schultz figured out how to do covid comedy
*  better than anybody. His videos that he does on Instagram on the phone
*  sideways. Amazing. I watch every single one of those. I'm like,
*  God damn, this kid's good. They're so good. They're so well written and
*  they're so fast and the pace and just his timing and his insight. And
*  he does a little little blind little jokes in there. I like when he
*  takes a little jabs at everybody. Yes. He's a he's a wizard at this
*  stuff. Yeah. Yeah. How old is Andrew? He's in his thirties. Thirty six.
*  Yeah. Just old enough to be smart enough. He knows what the fuck he's
*  doing. Yeah. But still young and wild. You know, he's one of those.
*  There's a few of those guys that are coming up that are in this day and
*  age with social media and cancel culture. It's very hard to be a wild
*  comedian. Yeah. You know, in our day when we were first starting, there
*  were no rules. There was no rules. Fucking Wild West. You were wild
*  because everybody else was wild and that was what you enjoyed. Like I
*  enjoy wild comedy. I've always enjoyed Kinnison and Pryor and when Joey Diaz
*  is going off, like that's that's my favorite. That's what I like. You know,
*  and so that's what we all did. But to be a guy like Schultz today is it's
*  a lot riskier to be Tim Dillon today. A lot riskier. Yeah. These guys,
*  but they figured it out, you know, because they're from the culture that
*  is canceling people. So they know the inside of it. They know like they kind
*  of know the lines in it. They know how to move though. That's what's weird.
*  Yeah. I mean, the lines are very blurred right now. And I keep thinking, you
*  know, I say it on stage too, but I'm like, you know, if they're, if they're
*  going to cancel it for what you're saying, they're not paying attention to
*  intent. They're not looking at the look in your face when you say something,
*  they don't look in your eyes. They don't hear, you know, that there's a lot of
*  cadence involved in a lot of things that you say that, uh, that take the
*  sting right out of it. And then I even said, if I was to read a transcript of
*  everything I said tonight, I'm like, this guy's a piece of shit and let's get
*  rid of him.
*  There's also temporary thoughts that go down as permanent record. You know,
*  when you're, especially if you're doing a podcast, you're just riffing, you're
*  talking shit, you're trying to make each other laugh. And if you take that and
*  make it a permanent record, like this is how this person feels.
*  Wait, will you see when this one airs, how many people got, get that son of a
*  bitch, get the fuck out of America. If you don't like it here, that's what I'm
*  going to hear. You're going to get a lot of that. And I'm like, no, you fuck.
*  I love it here. One bad thing about America though. Well, no,
*  the minute you say anything and you're not American, you automatically get the
*  fuck out is what you get.
*  What do you have to do to be American American? You're you have a green card.
*  I have a green card. You have to do to make the, make the leap. I just got to get a
*  assistant to take my seat. And a tattoo. You need an eagle. An eagle tattoo.
*  An eagle with a dick shaped like a gun. How about that? Wearing a gi.
*  Yes, I like it. But the gi is kind of originally Japanese. I know,
*  but I think I just in honor of.
*  Okay. American Eagle with a gi.
*  American Giegel. Do you have any tattoos? None. None. You thought about it?
*  I think about it now and then. I remember when you had none.
*  I had one. You had one little one on my shoulder. Yeah. And that was like,
*  in the past 10 years, you've definitely done a transformation.
*  Well, what I did was I w I wanted to get a sleeve and I did want it to be
*  patchwork. So I wanted to do it all one piece.
*  So I went to Aaron De La Vadova down at Guru tattooed San Diego.
*  We planned it out and he drew all these sketches of what it would look like.
*  And you know, it was a thought out thing. What was it? What is your sleeve?
*  Well, the first one's a lot. It's a dragon.
*  It's wrapped around this Buddha that's holding a DMT molecule.
*  It's pretty wild shit. Yeah. I just wanted, I wanted art, you know?
*  And everybody's like, Oh, you got a tattoo.
*  You're going to keep it for the rest of your life. Well, that's not that long.
*  Yeah. Guess what? You know? Yeah. Like what's better? Old skin.
*  People like, what's it going to look like when you're old?
*  Well, guess what? All old skin looks like shit.
*  Yeah. I at one point wanted a boxing glove holding a microphone.
*  I didn't do that.
*  No, I'm not glad cause I never got it. Every time somebody would draw it for me.
*  I was like, it doesn't look good.
*  When I was in high school, everybody had a fucking Tasmanian devil with boxing
*  gloves. That was the thing. I don't know why.
*  Then it became the tribal art became the, Oh yeah. Or a barbed wire around your
*  bicep. Yeah. Yeah. Or your ankle. If you're a gal or a dude who likes dudes.
*  Yeah. And then they would do like the tribal zigzags all over their back.
*  And I'm like, listen, you can tell that's like a timestamp on you now.
*  Yep. So you were, you were really big into tattoos 10 years ago, were you?
*  Yeah. The tribal thing's weird, right? Like why did that come in and go out?
*  Because it was white guys doing it who were never part of a fucking tribe.
*  It can't be tribal if you were never in a tribe.
*  That's so true. Like why do you have tribal shit? I was like, what tribe are you from?
*  I'm fucking Los Filas, bro.
*  You're not even from a tribe called quest.
*  That's so true. Why guys from a no tribe?
*  Because the tribal people still do it.
*  Do they though? Not like those kind of tattoos.
*  I mean like the Maori tattoos and all that. That's crazy.
*  Yeah, that's different.
*  That's like real hardcore tattooing.
*  Oh, they tap it in there too. Yeah.
*  They, a lot of guys, like there's a bunch of UFC fighters,
*  Taitui Vasa who has that shit from his waist down, like his legs.
*  He's got like shorts made out of it. You know, a lot of those guys, they,
*  they do it tapping. So they lay there and the guy has the stick.
*  You've seen the tapping. Yeah. Yeah. It looks painful as fuck.
*  It's gotta be never done it. My buddy Sturgill, he has one of those.
*  He's got like a quarter sleeve. I just like that his name is Sturgill.
*  Sturgill Simpson. That's a legit Southern there.
*  And like one of the name of Sterling and Virgil and they're like, okay,
*  we're going to call him Sturgill. Yeah, that's a good name for him.
*  It's perfect. Like he's Sturgill and he's got one of his tattoos.
*  He got from a Japanese master and that's how they did it with the tapping.
*  Yeah. It's a long laborious process, but that's a thing.
*  Like a lot of people that are real Japanese tattoo aficionados,
*  they'll go to Japan to get tattooed. That's how the Yakuza gets it. Right?
*  Yeah. Some of them, I'm sure some of them get it the other way now,
*  but they can do shit with tattoos. Now it's like, it's the art form has,
*  has evolved this to this crazy place where they can do like
*  photo realistic tattoos. Now that's incredible. You ever seen Steve butcher?
*  You know what that dude is? No,
*  but I've seen some of the guys that have your logo tattooed on them and it's
*  incredible how fucking realistic it looks.
*  I stopped posting them on Instagram cause I was getting so many of them. Yeah.
*  And then someone posted, yeah, that's Steve butcher. He did.
*  That's insane. It's insane. Well, he's insane period.
*  He's really fucking talented.
*  Somebody got somebody got Michael Jordan.
*  See, I would do some dumb shit like that. If I got a tattoo, probably,
*  you know, who's great to go to Ash Lewis, Ash, Ash Lewis tattoo.
*  He's got some amazing shit too.
*  And there's some that whole style of tattoos. Stan Lee.
*  Look at that. Yeah. That's really incredible when they get that. Like, yeah,
*  I guess that's Stanley one, Jamie. Let me take a look at that. Look at that. Fuck,
*  man. Like if I was to do, if I was to do it, I would do one like that.
*  Like a photo realistic one of both your baby's mama giving you the finger.
*  Yeah. On one on each thigh. I don't know if my thighs are big enough.
*  Oh, yeah. Robin Williams. That's amazing.
*  Yeah. But he got the worst movie ever. Patch Adams. That's hilarious.
*  That has to be a joke. Like Patch Adams. Have you ever seen Patch Adams?
*  I didn't watch. I mean, I probably did at the time, but I don't remember it.
*  It's I don't remember the premise. It's something really ridiculous.
*  Like a clown that works with cancer patients or something.
*  Something along those lines. Yeah, yeah. No, he was, he was a doctor who would,
*  who would use con. It was based on a real true story. What'd you say, Jamie?
*  Yes. Yeah.
*  It was a doctor who would come in and do silly things to make the patients laugh,
*  to try and help their spirits.
*  Yeah. But it was bad because they all died anyway.
*  Yeah. But they died with great spirit.
*  It was a really happy death. They had,
*  he was a rough one, man. When that guy hung himself, I was like,
*  yeah, you know, I never got to meet him.
*  I met him once at the improv was crazy.
*  I didn't know I was meeting him until like five minutes into the conversation.
*  I realized it was Robin Williams. How long ago was that? Years ago.
*  Obviously he's dead. Yeah. So not, not recent.
*  No. I don't remember, but I did a show at the improv.
*  It was quite a few years ago. I was, it was during the time of the podcast.
*  I did a show at the improv and then afterwards I'm shaking hands with people
*  and taking pictures and this very slight older man with a beard,
*  a heavy beard wearing a baseball hat comes up and he's like really
*  complimentary, but he obviously knows a lot about standup.
*  He's asking me questions about writing and questions about, you know,
*  like certain bits, like really laughing. And then I'm like, holy fuck,
*  this is Robin Williams. Like I did, I was like, Oh, thanks, man.
*  I really appreciate it. That's really cool. And like,
*  I just think he's some cool guy. And then I realized in the middle of the
*  conversation, this is Robin fucking Williams.
*  Cause he's got this crazy thick ass white beard.
*  Yeah. You almost grew a real bushy beard.
*  I think he was hiding, man. You know,
*  I think for a lot of folks that are like real sensitive and he's obviously a
*  real sensitive guy that, um,
*  that place of being that famous is fucking overwhelming.
*  That famous and known for whether you are or not,
*  but you're known for being always like on. Yeah.
*  And then there's the pressure of having to be on now.
*  So you don't disappoint the illusion. Yeah.
*  And that's gotta be fucking taxing.
*  It's gotta be always on. And then just also, you know,
*  it's just,
*  just the pressure of everyone recognizing you everywhere you go.
*  And I think one of the best recognitions I got was Bob Newhart.
*  10 years ago, he, I didn't even know he knew I existed,
*  but he invited me to be,
*  he was getting inducted into the television hall of fame for 50 years in the
*  business or something. And, uh,
*  and he wanted me to be there on behalf of the younger generation. And I'm like,
*  are you serious? And I remember I sat with Fred Willard and,
*  uh, uh, Manix. What's his name? Tom Connors,
*  I think Chuck Connors. Okay. Yeah.
*  I sat beside them while we were doing it and I was like, this is incredible.
*  And then that they had a private dinner after and it was,
*  and I was sitting at the table with Fred Willard and then, uh, uh,
*  the guy that was on bosom buddies with Tom Hanks. Oh, wow.
*  And then where's that guy?
*  Peter Scolari. That's an okay. Yeah. Right. And then, uh,
*  and then Dawn Rickles was there and Bob was just so fucking, he's still alive.
*  And I actually been meaning to call him just to check in on the guy. But, um,
*  but he was so funny. I remember he was about to make it.
*  He got up to make a speech. It was like this private dinner we had,
*  he gets up to make a speech in this woman is like, Bob, is this going to be funny?
*  Is this a funny speech? And everyone's like, who is this?
*  Who's fucking broad yelling? I'm saying, it's going to be funny, Bob, Bob,
*  it's just going to be funny. And Bob Newhart just goes,
*  why don't we all find out together? And I was like, it's fucking perfect.
*  It's so perfect. The perfect response. It wasn't like, Hey, shut up.
*  It was like, why don't we all find out together?
*  God, that is just, that's some people. It's like a master talking, you know?
*  Yeah. I mean, that's a lob. She lobbed and he smashed it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Some people are just so dull minded. Oh, we got it. Is it going to be funny?
*  Like she needed to know. She needed to know from him. Yeah.
*  How should we react to this? You know,
*  who's the first famous person that came to your show? Um, I don't remember the
*  first payments. Uh, well back in the mid nineties,
*  the Raptors used to come to my shows in Toronto,
*  a lot of them, because we would do this black comedy night once a month. Uh,
*  Kenny Robinson had the newbie and disciples of prior all black comedy shows,
*  the ABC of NDP. And, uh,
*  it started in April of 1995 and those shows would sell out every month to the
*  point where I had every gangster in the city calling me, yo,
*  I need you to put me on the list. I'm like, man, you're fucking killing me, dude.
*  He goes, yo, don't, don't embarrass me when I get there. Make sure I'm on.
*  I'm like, fuck. And I'm like, I go, Kenny,
*  I gotta put so-and-so on the list. Is he going to bring guns? I go,
*  I don't know what he's going to bring, but if he gets in and there's no problem,
*  you'll have no problems. And oh boy. Did you have a lot of metal detectors?
*  No. There was a shooting at the store one night. I remember that.
*  That was a couple of years ago. The guy shot a guy on the patio.
*  Yeah, that's a different time. That's someone, that was a murder.
*  That was someone came to kill somebody.
*  There was a shooting in the main room one night. I think,
*  I believe Tupac was there. Really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  I was off that night. I wasn't there. Was that, uh,
*  that must've been, uh, maybe tripping on Tuesdays or something. I don't know.
*  I don't know. Um, they used to have fat Tuesdays. Oh, fat Tuesdays.
*  That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then Guy Torrey took it over and had tripping on Tuesdays.
*  Is that what it was? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then Chris Spencer took it over.
*  Guy Torrey used to get up in the morning and do East Coast
*  radio from his home in LA.
*  That's, I couldn't do that shit. He would do it like five days a week.
*  I'm most positive that he did that.
*  I had Guy and Joe over my house as well. We were in the backyard having cigars.
*  Do you remember when Joe used to host Def Jam and he was jacked?
*  He's still in great shape. You know, he does a lot of martial arts as well.
*  Does he? Yeah. What did he do?
*  He did some, uh, some taekwondo and he did some, uh,
*  Greco-Roman wrestling and stuff like that. No shit. Yeah.
*  But he was one of the first guys ever to be funny and jacked. Yeah. But I,
*  he, uh, listen, he was one of my favorites.
*  I think he's one of the reasons too that I talked to the crowd so much because
*  he, I used to watch him do that and I go, I love that. Yeah.
*  I know you hate when I do it, but.
*  Well, it's not that I hate it. It's a, if I go on afterwards,
*  they want to talk to me too. No, see, I don't get them talking.
*  I just ask them questions.
*  And the way I ask them questions, it doesn't make,
*  doesn't open it up for a conversation.
*  It opens up to that they want to shut up now.
*  I try to approach it that way, like a jab, you know? I get it. I understand.
*  I want to make sure you're good when you go on. I understand.
*  I get it out of their system, Joe. I understand. Well, you like to do that too.
*  That's how you form material, right? That's exactly how I write.
*  I remember you and I, I felt bad after last time we had dinner,
*  he yelled at me like, just fucking stop being lazy. And I go, listen, Joe,
*  this is my process. I definitely didn't yell at you.
*  Well, you know, you talk very, you said, no, you said, I can't write.
*  And I said, you definitely can write. Don't say you can't write.
*  You definitely can write. You just don't do it. It's true. Everybody can write.
*  Yeah. I mean, I used to write, but I need pen and a pad.
*  I got to go do it the old school way. Yeah. Well, it's like for us,
*  we're also ADD. It's hard to just sit alone,
*  just to sit alone with your thoughts.
*  But I feel like there's a bunch of different things you can do.
*  You can write on stage, which is great. You can write throughout the day,
*  just have ideas, then run them on stage. All that's great. But it's none of that.
*  Nothing's preventing you from actually sitting and writing as well.
*  And like, I feel like when you sit and write,
*  you have an opportunity to develop different concepts, different ideas.
*  And I get it. And I've been meaning to this whole quarantine,
*  but I thought I would be the most motivated guy.
*  I think every comic thought we were going to come out of this quarantine with
*  an entire new act that was so fucking well written.
*  And everybody I talked to was like, what'd you do? Nothing.
*  I couldn't fucking sit down and do it. I didn't write at all. No, me neither.
*  I didn't write it all on purpose. First of all,
*  because I didn't know how I felt. Cause I was like, this was like,
*  when this shit locked down, first of all,
*  everybody thought it like large percentage of us were going to die. Right?
*  Yeah. We didn't know what the fuck was happening. Nobody knew.
*  We saw the footage from China where they're driving down the street,
*  spraying that stuff into the buildings. We didn't know.
*  So we thought like, man, what if we all like,
*  what if we're losing a lot of our friends? I was worried about Diaz.
*  I was worried about Tim Dillon. I was worried about big people.
*  I was worried about older people. You know,
*  Joey was one of the guys who checked on me weekly.
*  He checks on everybody. He's awesome. Yeah. He's fucking great. He was like,
*  I love you brother. I'm just checking on you. How's everything?
*  Tell me something good cocksucker. Yeah. He's a beautiful person. He really is.
*  I, I, it is, it is shocking what a sweet human being he is. Yeah.
*  He's so gruff on the outside and his stories are so crazy that people get this
*  distorted impression of who he is. But Joey Diaz is a saint.
*  And you would want to think that he's going to want to hang out with everybody
*  and party. He does not like that shit at all. He gets the fuck out of there.
*  Yeah. Too many people. I gotta go. Yeah.
*  One person asked me the wrong fucking question. I'm out of there. Yeah.
*  He just likes to go in and crush and then get out of there like a legend.
*  It's great.
*  Still drives a Subaru.
*  Joey, please get a nice car. Get a Cadillac. Fuck I hate that for Joe. Yeah,
*  that's him. I don't give a fuck about that shit. Joe Rogan.
*  What do I gotta do with a fucking Cadillac? What did you get?
*  Did you get anything to celebrate your Spotify thing?
*  Did you buy a nice car for yourself? No, no, I haven't bought anything. No, no.
*  I have enough cars. Yeah, you do. I think it's maybe a watch or something,
*  something that says, Hey, no, no, I'm just living like I always lived.
*  Just trying to concentrate on doing good shows, trying to concentrate on when,
*  especially when Spotify launches,
*  I want to just get real good guests and be prepared. And I want to, you know,
*  I'm always trying to- That's why I'm glad I'm on now before you start getting good guests again.
*  Fuck that. You're coming on, bitch. I'm always trying to,
*  you know, do my best. That's what I concentrate on.
*  I feel like if I steer away from that in anything, I fuck up.
*  Yeah. No, you gotta just keep it what you're doing. Yeah.
*  Just keep trying to do my best and not even thinking about all that other stuff.
*  I remember when they would be in your house.
*  You'd walk in and it was right on the right hand side in that little ass room.
*  My little office. Yeah. That was the studio. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That was the first time I did it. It was a December of 2010.
*  Nobody was watching. Nobody. And you were like, you want to do it? I go, yeah,
*  I don't even know what it is, but I'll do it.
*  We would have like 200 people viewing live. Yeah. Yes.
*  You were doing live ones too. That was Red Band who figured that shit out already.
*  Well, that's how we started it. We started it on a laptop with Ustream,
*  just answering questions. Ustream. That's what it was. Yeah. Ustream.
*  And then we moved over to YouTube later on, but it was, it was just for fun.
*  The YouTube clips keep me very entertained on the road. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I'll go look for a subject that I want to hear about and there'll be like a 12 to
*  15 minute clip. I got perfect. That's one of the good things about the Spotify
*  deals. What Spotify is going to do is they're going to organize things like all
*  the health and wellness podcasts are going to be organized. All the fitness ones,
*  all the martial arts ones, all the ones with scientists,
*  all the ones on archeology, animals, paleontology, all those,
*  all the different ones are going to be organized so you could,
*  you could actually search shit. Have you thought about doing a podcast?
*  I have thought about it. Yeah. This is the perfect time, Russell Peters.
*  I mean, I really want to, but I, you know, baby, I need some,
*  can you put me on under your wing? Everybody wants that. Not really wing,
*  just let me use a space or something. Figure it out and I'll fucking,
*  I'll tweet it for you.
*  That'll help actually. Yeah. I'll tell people. I mean, I, you know,
*  I do on the Instagram live a lot. I'll, I'll talk to like, uh, like I'll pull up,
*  like, you know, look who's there. And I'm like, Oh look,
*  there's crazy lakes from rock steady crew and I'll add him.
*  We'll do like a live chat and we'll, and it's not the basic, Hey,
*  so tell me about breakdancing. We just have a conversation and it's actually
*  really good. And then I get like, you know, I'll have a, you know, uh,
*  a rapper, uh, one of my favorite rappers will be on or something, you know,
*  and it's just fun shit. You know who I was hanging out with in Houston?
*  Willie D. I saw that. I saw that.
*  Dude, I hadn't done standup in like 90 plus days and Willie came down to the
*  show and he's like, this weekend, right? This weekend. Yeah.
*  And he's like, which show should I come to my, please come to the second show.
*  I don't want a bomb in front of Willie D. But it was even the first show was fun.
*  It was great. It went great. First of all, the audience was so enthusiastic.
*  People were so happy to be out and so happy to do things.
*  And the day we got there, we weren't even sure I was with Brian Moses and Tony
*  Hinchcliffe. And we weren't sure whether or not we were going to even be able to
*  do the show because we got seeing Brian Moses from, I don't think he could do
*  the show.
*  He killed. Um, but we, uh, got there and there was a stage one COVID alert that
*  they had moved back to stage one and I was, or phase one, I was like, what does
*  that mean? And they're like, well, they're closing down all the bars. I'm
*  like, oh fuck. I thought we're going to have to literally get on the plane and
*  go back home. But then they said, nope, we're going to just keep the shows
*  rolling. And then, uh, Houston is Texas and Texas is different. They just, they
*  have, you know, they're, they're closing down the bars, but they keep the
*  restaurants open at 50% capacity.
*  I really like Texas. I love it there. I know. Like I think I could move to Texas,
*  but I couldn't go where you're going to go. Where would you go? Dallas? Yeah.
*  Dallas. I love Dallas. I liked Dallas a lot or Houston maybe, but Dallas probably
*  more likely.
*  I love all of them, man. I just love Texas. I love the attitude. I do. It's very
*  diverse. It feels like its own country. Yeah, there's all kinds of shit.
*  And I think it gets a bum rap for a lot of things. I mean, sure. Those things
*  exist over there, but I don't think that's what it's about over there.
*  Definitely not Austin. Austin is a really open minded, interesting place.
*  It's like a hipster city. Yeah. It's an interesting place. It's, um,
*  I had a good time like going and watching live bands and shit in Austin.
*  You know, they've got some great music and stuff like that. Sixth Street. Yeah.
*  Yeah. But I, I, listen, that heat is intense over there.
*  I like heat. No, I like heat too, but dude, it's a fucking dumb heat.
*  Like I, but I'm like, God damn, Van Indian guys complaining about the heat.
*  Something's wrong with the heat, dude. It's good for you though.
*  It's good for you that moist heat. It was, uh,
*  we shot a movie there, me and Faison about five years ago.
*  Damn, I haven't seen Faison forever. Faison's great. You should have him on.
*  You know, you'd have a fucking great conversation with Faison.
*  He's really intelligent despite his exterior. He's actually got a lot of, uh,
*  he's got a lot of interesting, uh, perceptive thoughts.
*  Very, very good dude too. He's a great guy, solid guy.
*  And you guys were in Texas. Yeah, we were shooting one day.
*  So one day we were shooting was like the hottest day of the year that day was
*  like in July. I think it was like 118 or something like that.
*  And Texas 118 is different. Oh, it's not a good 118.
*  So we were supposed to shoot the scene outside. They were like, fuck,
*  it's too hot. We'll shoot it under this bridge for shade.
*  And it was a scene where these kids are break dancing and then I jump in and
*  break dance with them. So I had to like do a top rock and some waves and shit,
*  but I'm like, dude, and then an action and reset. I'm like, no, dude,
*  I'm going to fucking dive. Maybe.
*  So we shoot the whole day of this thing and I'm fucking dead. Like my shirt,
*  I'm wearing a blue shirt so you can see when I sweat and everything.
*  Then I'm like, Oh, thank God that's over. And they go, okay,
*  we're relocating over there.
*  We're going to do the roller skating. It's going to go on the hottest fucking day
*  of the year. You want me to roller skate outside? Yeah, we're going to do it.
*  That's the thing about movies, right? They got to jam those 12 hour days in.
*  Oh yeah. We were doing a 14 to 15 hour days because it was non union.
*  Movies are hard, man. You know, it's not a hard like coal mining,
*  but it's hard in that it's, it beats you up.
*  A lot of comics that wind up getting into movies, their act sort of suffers.
*  Yeah. Well it's one or the other. Yes. You can't,
*  you know, you can't be you on the movie set. You got to be that character.
*  Well, I always tell everybody that I bet that's why Eddie Murphy stopped doing
*  standup. I mean, it's just like his, his movies were doing so good and he,
*  you know, you're more insulated in that world too. You got too famous too.
*  It's like, it's almost like it's a better way to do it. Yeah.
*  What do you think he's going to be like when he comes back?
*  Who knows if he's gonna, I mean, it's a lot of money on the line for him.
*  I'm sure he's got a lot. He's got a lot of money, but I mean, shit.
*  I watched Norbert the other night. I've been talking to people.
*  I saw you post about it. It's fucking funny, man. It's funny.
*  What's coming to America the next night? Family movie night.
*  What was that movie he did with Owen Wilson? Lie spy or something like that.
*  Something spy. I spy. Was it? Hmm. I don't know.
*  It was actually a really good movie. I enjoyed that movie a lot.
*  He's done a lot of fucking movies, man.
*  He's one of those guys where his movies don't get the respect that they deserve
*  for some strange reason. Like, uh, what was that one that he did with Steve Martin?
*  Uh, both finger. That is a fucking great movie.
*  Do you know the story behind that? Right? No.
*  But the Heather Graham character was allegedly Anne Hesch.
*  I was supposed to be is based on Anne Hesch. Really? That's what I heard.
*  Based on her. Yeah. How she was dating Steve Martin.
*  Then she ended up with a woman. Yeah. And then ended up,
*  what did she end up with? Then she ended up with Ellen DeGeneres.
*  And then she ended up marrying a man after that. That's right.
*  Just keep it moving. Yeah. Whoever's going to take me. I'm good with it.
*  I actually met her and she's very nice too. So, you know,
*  I thought whatever happened to her, man,
*  she was shooting a series up in Canada for a little while. That's where I met her.
*  But Eddie, you know, the problem with Eddie was not the problem.
*  What happened with Eddie was his movies in the eighties were so fucking huge.
*  You know, it's like opening with a phenomenal joke and then the rest of your act,
*  you can't follow it despite how good the rest of the jokes are.
*  But so many of those movies were still really good.
*  They just didn't get the respect for some reason.
*  Like Beverly Hills Cop 48 Hours coming to America, trading places.
*  I mean, hit after hit after hit. Not like a little bit of a hit.
*  He was the man. And then, you know, you got another 48 hours and then you got
*  Beverly Hills Cop two and three. Even they were good.
*  Yes. That was the first time I saw sequels that were like, wow,
*  that's just as fucking good as the first one.
*  But wasn't there like a time period where he wasn't doing films or they weren't as
*  popular and then you get films like Bowfinger and.
*  Yeah. So I think after he did that one movie, it was like
*  like a military kind of movie in the late eighties.
*  It was somewhere around.
*  Did you try to branch out or something?
*  After Golden Child, it kind of fell apart a little bit.
*  Oh, is that what it was?
*  Yeah.
*  Was that pre or post My Girl Wants to Party All the Time?
*  That was post.
*  OK, so that was an issue.
*  Yeah, that was.
*  But that.
*  My girl wants to.
*  You know, Finest Henderson?
*  Yeah, sure. Yeah.
*  You know, he wrote that for Eddie.
*  Really? Yeah, apparently.
*  Finest. Finest told me he wrote it for him. Wow.
*  He was I used to help Eddie with that back in the day.
*  And because Finest was actually a really big.
*  He had a really big song back in the day called Skip to My Lou.
*  Really? Yeah, it was a really dope R&B track, like early 80s.
*  I remember I was in New York City and Eddie Murphy had that song.
*  No, I was in Boston.
*  I was in Boston and Eddie Murphy had that song come out.
*  I was like, this guy can do anything.
*  That was one of those things where like when a person does it like.
*  And Rick James produced it for him.
*  Did he really? Oh, that makes sense. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's some of those guys who could just kind of do anything.
*  They can do movies. They can do comedy.
*  He's got a reggae album out now. You know that?
*  What? Yeah, it came out like three years ago.
*  I think. Yeah. Eddie Murphy.
*  Yeah. A couple of years ago, Eddie Murphy released a reggae album.
*  See, I always feel like with certain dudes,
*  like whether it's him or Jamie Foxx or dudes who just have like this really
*  diverse set of skills, they're probably just always doing something,
*  whether you know about it or not.
*  They got they're just creatives that they can't stop creating. Right.
*  And then they get, you know, I think the thing with a lot of people are creative
*  and a lot of people, I think what you need is the.
*  What is this? Eddie Murphy. That's the reggae.
*  Red Light featuring Snoop Dogg.
*  Whoa. Snoop Lion. Look at this.
*  He's playing guitar.
*  Yeah, he plays instruments and shit.
*  OK, we can't play any of it, but it's a flashing.
*  This little I'm going to have to go and get this now.
*  That's correct. But I'm not shocked, man.
*  I'm not shocked.
*  And I and I know he was thinking about doing stand up again,
*  but I do not know if he's actually doing stand up.
*  Do you know? I was at his house
*  January of last year, January 2019.
*  Tiffany Haddish took me to his house.
*  And it was this night that I was really not supposed to be there.
*  I wasn't invited, but Tiffany was like, come with me.
*  And I'm like, hell, yeah.
*  So I went and it was then it was this incredible fucking night
*  at Eddie Murphy's house where
*  I walked downstairs for a first person I see is Jamie Foxx.
*  It was like, hey, man, what's up? I'm like, what's up, Jamie?
*  Like, yeah. And then and then I turn I see Neil Brennan.
*  And then I and then I look at the bar and I see Sasha
*  Baron Cohen and Isla Fisher sitting at the bar.
*  And I'm like, what the fuck have I won?
*  Then I see Kimmel. Then I see Bill Hader.
*  And then I hear behind me, yeah, is this what you comedians always do?
*  Hang out with each other.
*  And I turn around and it's Q-tip from A Tribe Called Quest.
*  And I'm like, what up, Tep?
*  And they're like, what the fuck is going?
*  What have I walked into? Wow.
*  And then Jeff Ross was there.
*  And then Chappelle came. Chris Rock came.
*  And I was like, what have I fucking walked into?
*  But the good thing is, you know, because you were comics, we all know each other.
*  And then, you know, I'd only met Eddie once for like a split second at a fight.
*  And he knew my name then.
*  But when I walked when I walked in the basement, he goes, hey, Russell,
*  thanks for coming. I'm like, hey, Murphy knows my name.
*  That's all I can think of.
*  Holy shit, Eddie Murphy knows my name.
*  I met him once with Charlie.
*  I ran into Charlie. Charlie was so great.
*  He was such a sweet guy.
*  Charlie and I did a tour together for Maxim,
*  the Bud Light comedy tour and with John Heffron.
*  And then just randomly,
*  I was in Maui and just Charlie was in Maui.
*  And I went over and sat with him.
*  And Eddie Murphy was weird.
*  It was so strange.
*  How was he when he was with Charlie?
*  It's real friendly, man.
*  Yeah, he was really nice.
*  There was like nothing weird about him.
*  And now he's super friendly.
*  First words, he goes, you're a funny motherfucker.
*  Yeah. I was like, oh, my God.
*  Yeah, these are the things I faint.
*  Yeah, dude, I I was like that whole night.
*  I honestly didn't say a fucking word to anybody.
*  I was just in shock the entire time.
*  I was just like, I know every time I turn my head.
*  And then I was standing in a doorway like that.
*  And it's it's me standing beside Eddie and then Chris Rock,
*  Jamie Foxx and Neil Brennan.
*  And they're all trying to convince him to do stand up again.
*  Wow. And I'm just there like.
*  I have nothing to add to this conversation.
*  Like, I'm not on Jamie's level, not on Chris's level.
*  You know, Neil created spells.
*  I'm like, I'm just there, but they didn't make me feel like,
*  what are you doing here? They made me feel included.
*  That was nice. But that is nice.
*  But, you know, there was like Eddie's like, I haven't done it in 30 years.
*  I'm like, I'm pretty sure you've still got it.
*  Oh, he's got it. He said he said he's got about five minutes.
*  I got about five minutes.
*  But, you know, you guys are out there doing it every day.
*  And I know I know he wants to do it.
*  But it depends on how he approaches it, you know.
*  Well, it depends on how he feels.
*  If he just decides he wants to do it.
*  The thing about stand up is that you have to do it in front of people.
*  You know, you got to go out there and do it.
*  There's no theory to it. Right. Yeah.
*  It's not like music.
*  You can you could create an album with just you and your friends.
*  You can't really create a comedy set without being
*  at a place where you're going to have random people come and pay money to see you talk.
*  And that's the other problem he's got to overcome is that people are going to be coming expecting.
*  You know, maybe they were expecting delirious or raw coming out of him.
*  Right. It's a 60 year old man.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He's got fucking 10 or 11 kids.
*  I think he does.
*  It's a there's a when I when I met him when I was at his house is
*  his baby was only maybe a couple of months old or a month old.
*  Wow. And then end of the night, I got stuck in the basement
*  of his house. What happened?
*  Well, everyone was leaving and I didn't know where Tiffany went.
*  And I'm literally standing against the wall.
*  And I'm the only uninvited guy there, really.
*  Do you know what I mean? Like all the Netflix people were there.
*  And I'm like, oh, boy, I don't know what the bottom.
*  And I'm looking around, I don't know where the fuck Tiffany went.
*  And and finally, like as me and then eight of Eddie's kids were sitting at this one table
*  and I'm just standing there like a creep, like right across from them.
*  And I see Kenya Barris going upstairs.
*  I was like, can you don't leave without me?
*  So I left. I went up with him.
*  And as you walked up, they had the door open to suggest just get the fuck out of the house.
*  And I was like, said the lady, hey,
*  I came with Tiffany and she's kind of my ride
*  because she did. She picked me up.
*  And I'm like, I don't know where she is.
*  And then they were like, oh, I think she went to the backyard.
*  I go, OK. And I'm like, I don't like what am I supposed to do with that?
*  I'm not going to go walking around the guys out.
*  Right. Where do you how do you get to the backyard?
*  One of the thank God one of his sons was walking by and goes,
*  oh, I'll take you to the backyard.
*  And I was like, thank goodness.
*  So go to the backyard. It's massive backyard.
*  And this fucking house is insane.
*  Where does he live? Beverly Hills.
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  But in that really exclusive gated community there, like where Denzel lives alone.
*  Yeah. And these massive houses.
*  Yeah. Like I think I think honestly, it was about 30,000 square feet.
*  The house. How weird must that be to be that guy to like
*  you know, know those people, who those people are when you're young
*  and then all of a sudden you're one of them people.
*  It's listen, I mean, I'm still aghast from it a year and a half later.
*  I can only imagine.
*  I mean, there's like an exclusive A-list celebrity group of humans. Yeah.
*  And there's I guess like when a guy like him has a party like that,
*  like those are the only people that are just going to be semi normal around him.
*  Yeah. You know, he can't have that.
*  Eddie, is this is this going to be a funny speech?
*  Yeah, no, none of that. You can't have no fucking weirdos.
*  Can't have any.
*  And that's why I didn't want to say anything, because I wasn't sure what I'm
*  like, am I going to say something stupid and be like, who brought this guy?
*  You can't have any normies.
*  Yeah. And I felt too normal. Yeah.
*  I felt, you know, it felt like a mortal.
*  Isn't that funny? Like, like you go to the comic store, you fit right in. Yeah.
*  But if you go like when you're around too many celebrities, you do feel like a fraud.
*  Yeah. Well, and that's the thing, too. Like you and I, both friends with Chappelle.
*  I've known Dave 25 years and when it's just me and him
*  hanging out, it's literally like me and Dave hanging out. Yeah.
*  And then, you know, then you go somewhere and then he gets spotted by people
*  and he gets elevates and then you become like, hey, I'll be over here.
*  He just carry on over there.
*  Dave took me to one of the weirdest parties ever.
*  He took me to this Naomi Campbell party in the Hollywood Hills.
*  And we had a drive up to the house and then you had to take like
*  some weird elevator from the downstairs house to the upstairs house.
*  And as we're driving up the upstairs house, there's a photo of Naomi Campbell.
*  It's like 40 feet tall.
*  It's on the side of this building.
*  And it's her naked.
*  It's a 40 foot tall, naked Naomi Campbell.
*  And then you're riding on this elevator.
*  You get up there. Demi Moore's there and Lenny Kravitz is there.
*  I'm like, this is so strange.
*  And Dave said one of the funniest things ever goes, man,
*  I would never want to be this famous.
*  I go, look at me, motherfucker.
*  You're the most famous person here.
*  He's like, no way.
*  I go, yeah, you're the most famous person here.
*  And we were both laughing about it.
*  Like, you know, he became famous without real or maybe doesn't realize it
*  or maybe doesn't think about it, which is why he's so funny,
*  because he just concentrates on just life.
*  He's still Dave. Yeah.
*  Like when you hang out with him, he still has the same
*  sensibilities about him.
*  100 percent.
*  Like when I like when he was shooting Half Baked in Toronto,
*  maybe 24, 23 years ago,
*  I was with him every day on set.
*  I would hang out in his trailer,
*  hang out with his dog.
*  He had a little white Pomeranian back then named Thelonious.
*  And and I would take him for like drives through,
*  like to my hometown, Brampton, Ontario.
*  I'd be like, where the fuck we going?
*  I go, I'm going to take you to this magnetic hill out in Caledon.
*  So I took him to this hill.
*  You drive down and the car rolls up. What?
*  It's a it's an optical illusion.
*  I still can't figure it out even when you're there.
*  But it looks like you're driving down the car rolls up the hill.
*  You put your car in neutral and it rolls up.
*  But it's not really rolling up.
*  No, it looks like it is.
*  And you can't unsee it.
*  You're like it is rolling up.
*  But then when you get out and stand, you kind of see that, no,
*  it's kind of on an angle,
*  but because there's a road going up like this above it.
*  Oh, so it looks like it's going down, but it really it's not.
*  OK. Yeah, it's pretty wild.
*  I can't even imagine what that looks like.
*  And then there's a road right there that we call the roller coaster road.
*  It's like a really windy road with all these fucking humps.
*  And we would drive play like drum and bass.
*  And then and I would drive really fast over this road
*  and feel like a roller coaster.
*  Do you hear they're doing a new one?
*  What? Half Baked 2.
*  Are they really? Yeah. Shut up. Yeah.
*  With Dave? No, someone's playing Dave's son.
*  Who? Little Deval?
*  I don't know.
*  He's too old.
*  He's too old, but it would be perfect if he was younger.
*  What is this? Is this the road?
*  He's rolling backwards up a hill.
*  That's not it. No, no, no.
*  That's not it. It's not a tree line road like that.
*  Magnetic. But it is.
*  It is very much like that. OK.
*  It looks like that.
*  And then you roll up and it fucks your whole head up. Hmm.
*  Interesting. But then we went out there and it was like, man,
*  what the fuck we're doing all the way out here.
*  And I'm like, don't worry about it, man.
*  I'm sure you this.
*  We took on the road is like, oh, that's it right there.
*  That's actually it.
*  OK, looks like you're rolling downhill. You guys are idiots.
*  No, you're driving.
*  You drive downhill. Now watch you roll up.
*  Dude, you're rolling downhill.
*  Now it's backwards. What?
*  I think they show you they put the car in neutral
*  and then the car starts going backwards.
*  Right, because it's going downhill. Jesus Christ.
*  No, no, no. He's going backwards up a hill.
*  That's not up. Yeah, it is.
*  That is definitely not up.
*  When you're there, your eyes will deceive you.
*  OK, I believe you.
*  I don't know.
*  Like when you look at it like this, you could see that it's.
*  Canadian education, you know, it's free.
*  Hey, hey, at least it's free.
*  It's free here, too. It's terrible.
*  They're cutting the budget.
*  That's one of the responses to COVID.
*  They're going to cut the education budget.
*  How about you cut your salary, you fucks?
*  I don't think they have a good salary.
*  The teachers do they? Not the teachers.
*  I'm talking about the politicians. Oh, yeah.
*  It's not the teachers call to cut their salaries.
*  I guarantee you that.
*  Sure. The teachers. I'm like, hey, guys, just take my money.
*  It's fine. I don't think that letter works anymore. It did.
*  Be a sad time to be in school in L.A.
*  They all have to wear masks and they're going to have to wear
*  the teachers have to wear shields over their face.
*  I my daughter has been zooming the zooms
*  and then my fucking ex-wife signed her up for summer school.
*  That sucks, dude.
*  You got her on summer school zoom.
*  I'm like, that's not even. Oh, that's not school.
*  Yeah, I know that's shitty.
*  They're doing camp for some kids.
*  They're doing like temperature checks and shit.
*  And they're going to do camp.
*  Really? No, not her. She's doing like the day before school
*  start, Daddy, is it too late if I don't want to go to summer
*  school? I go, baby, I would never have signed you up
*  for summer school, but mommy did.
*  So we got to do it.
*  I mean, she means well, you know, the mommy does.
*  Yeah, I'm sure.
*  It's also like, I think mommy's won a little bit of a break.
*  I would have taken her. Yeah.
*  You know, she's fine. She could have been with me.
*  Well, this is a good time to really be in school.
*  She's fine. She could have been with me.
*  Well, this is a good time to really bond with your kids.
*  Well, that's that's what I mean.
*  My daughter, like, you know, wants to be in my house 24 seven now.
*  Daddy's house is the fun house. That's why. Yeah.
*  Oh, I don't have to shower till 10 at night. This is awesome.
*  Are you going to continue to go on the road?
*  And if you do go on the road, are you getting tested like every time when you come back?
*  Yeah, I think that's what it's going to have to go.
*  Yeah, that's what I've been doing.
*  I got not doing it anymore, though.
*  I'm not I'm not doing any more road gigs, not for months.
*  I decided after this Houston one, I was like, if I brought it back,
*  I'm like, I'm just doing this for fun.
*  It's like, yeah, we're doing standup again. This is amazing.
*  And then I thought about it.
*  I'm like, yeah, but if I bring it back,
*  you know, if I commercial and everything, no, I'll say smart.
*  And you didn't do any meet and greets. No, no, I tried to do it.
*  I did it just for the experience.
*  It was the whole idea was like, let's just go there.
*  Let's have fun. We'll do it for the experience.
*  And then when we come back, we'll reassess.
*  But then what would freak me out is coming back is like if I gave it
*  to other people, that's the number one fear that I have.
*  You know, I had your guy, I had your guy come and test me on Monday.
*  Abe. Yeah. And he'll get it.
*  He got 24 hours. Yeah.
*  He did the he sent somebody they did the finger one, which was immediate.
*  And then they did the other one that came.
*  I got the results the very next day, which I thought was really great.
*  I've been tested.
*  One, seven, nine times, I think nine times since this thing started.
*  Have you been micro dosing at all?
*  A little bit every now and then. Want to do some right now?
*  I've never done it.
*  Oh, you know, I'm the CCO of a company that does a micro dosing company.
*  Yeah. How do they do that if it's all super illegal?
*  Well, no. So what it is is it's a company called Red Light Holland.
*  And it's the truffle.
*  The truffle. So it's the the top.
*  The mushroom cap is the illegal part.
*  What? The stem, which is the truffle, is not illegal.
*  They're going to jail. OK, listen.
*  So we're in the process.
*  We're in the process of getting it all legalized and done the right way.
*  And it'll be available in in the Netherlands first.
*  Micro dosing.
*  And and then eventually we're hoping goes the way of marijuana.
*  Well, I think it can.
*  Right now, everything's in flux.
*  Everything's all fucked up right now, particularly in California.
*  Chappelle wanted me to do mushrooms with him.
*  He said, you got to do mushrooms.
*  I go, I've never done it because you got to do with me and John Mayer.
*  I'm like, oh, I got this heavy.
*  Yeah, I go. John starts singing.
*  Yeah. I go. You guys are both professionals at this.
*  I'm not. I don't want to be the guy fucking crying in the corner.
*  Are you nervous about it?
*  Yeah, I don't know what it does.
*  So I do a little bit.
*  Just do a little do a little and you're fine.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You just try it out.
*  You do a little.
*  Should I be alone when I do it?
*  The first time you should do it with a friend who knows how to.
*  Yeah, I would say just to take a one cap to something light.
*  You'll feel good.
*  The mushrooms want you to like them.
*  And so the first time you do it, they're going to welcome you.
*  They're going to be like, oh, man, this is what you should be doing.
*  I'm going to straighten out all your personal problems.
*  All these weird personality ticks that you got, all this strange
*  shit, the trouble you keep getting yourself into.
*  I can do to help you.
*  The mushrooms are going to talk to you. We'll help you.
*  And then one day they're going to trick you into taking a large dose.
*  And then you're going to meet the aliens.
*  And you're going to realize that this this
*  dimension that we live in is.
*  It's connected to neighboring dimensions that are accessible
*  through certain psychedelics.
*  And then once you see that, you can never unsee it.
*  You can. It's regular life loses its seriousness.
*  It loses like 20 percent of its seriousness.
*  It's still serious, still regular life.
*  But 20 percent of it goes away.
*  Forever, because you know that that's possible.
*  You know that these other worlds exist and that other people are just out there
*  running through their entire life from birth to death.
*  And they never experienced those worlds.
*  And it's that's that's weird because like you're running around.
*  Like I run into people because people know that I've done
*  a lot of psychedelic drugs.
*  So I'll run into people that know and they've done it, too.
*  And they look at you and they'll they'll talk to you like, hey, man, you know,
*  I did this because of you.
*  Like a buddy of mine said that to me the other day.
*  You gave me the courage to try this psychedelic drug.
*  And I was like, oh, shit, what was it like?
*  And he's like, what did he take?
*  He took DMT and he's like, that's a little bit more advanced, I would imagine.
*  Mm hmm. And this guy's a he's a bad motherfucker.
*  He's a Navy SEAL.
*  And but never had any any experience like that.
*  They need. What was his experience with it?
*  Well, I mean, I would have to talk to him more in depth.
*  But when everybody does it,
*  you what you get when they're describing it,
*  is just sort of like trying to use words to describe something where there's no references.
*  It's not the words don't work.
*  Like you could kind of tell me what it was like and I could kind of go, yeah, OK,
*  I kind of see that because I've done it.
*  But if I if I hadn't done it, there's no way I've known.
*  I have nothing.
*  It's like somebody trying to explain their dream to you.
*  Well, that's what's similar in this stuff.
*  DMT is actually endogenous.
*  It exists in the human body and they believe that it comes out in your dreams.
*  They believe that when you're dreaming, your body is releasing some of that stuff.
*  They don't.
*  They don't totally understand it, right?
*  It's one of those weird things where they they really only found out that
*  mammals created in the pineal gland within the last few years.
*  The Cottonwood Research Foundation, which is connected to Rick Strassman,
*  who wrote that book, DMT, the spirit molecule.
*  He ran a bunch of FDA approved.
*  I think I believe the only FDA approved tests
*  on DMT where they shot it into people in a clinical setting.
*  How did you assume it's free basing it?
*  You free base it really?
*  Yeah, like a fiend.
*  Yeah, like a fiend.
*  It's like a glass bowl connected to like a tube.
*  And you light the bottom of the bowl.
*  The DMT sits inside the what is the looks like a white powder,
*  like a white, almost yellowish white powder.
*  Depending on which one you take, the five methoxy DMT is white.
*  And then the other stuff was more like white with like a little bit of yellow to it.
*  And you take it. It tastes like burnt plastic.
*  It tastes terrible.
*  And you take a big, deep breath.
*  You want to take like three big inhales.
*  The first time I did it only took one.
*  And I just got to the door.
*  I got like to the door of the DMT dimension.
*  I was like, what is this weird?
*  It was really weird.
*  But I didn't even know what weird was because like 20 minutes later,
*  I did a second one and the second one.
*  I took way more. I took like three big hits.
*  And then it was almost like you're in a slingshot or catapult.
*  It was like you could feel the tension, like
*  and also you shot through these colors and lights
*  into what felt like some new place.
*  What is your physical doing during all of this?
*  Laying there, laying there.
*  You know, one time recently I did it, like the last time I did it,
*  it was a couple of years ago, I opened my eyes in the middle of it.
*  It was very strange.
*  It's like I can almost see reality, but it was all real pixelated.
*  And it was like I was seeing life through like
*  a dirty Saran wrap or something.
*  It was all very strange.
*  And then I closed my eyes back and I went into the experience
*  of the psychedelic realm is more vivid than regular life, which is real strange
*  because it doesn't feel like you're on a drug because you're still you.
*  That's another part of it.
*  It doesn't change your like when you're drunk, it changes the way you think.
*  Like you think different.
*  This is not that this is like you think the same way,
*  but you're being confronted with something that's insanely alien,
*  just alien to everything that you know to be true.
*  And then there's all these things around you that seem to be alive.
*  And they seem to be talking to you and communicating to you.
*  The last time I did it, it was a bunch of jokers that were giving me the finger,
*  like jesters, gestures with like, you know, they have the little bell.
*  They were all like shaking and give me the finger and like spinning around
*  like going, fuck you.
*  They were mocking me.
*  And the thing that I got from it was like, oh, I take myself too seriously.
*  I need to be mocked.
*  And they were mocking me.
*  And as they were mocking me, I relaxed.
*  And then they like pointed at me like, oh, you got it.
*  Yeah, you get it. You get it.
*  Because you can, you know, you can get lost.
*  You can take yourself seriously and you want others to take you.
*  Like, what is the grossest kind of man, like the kind of man
*  who wants everyone to tremble when he walks into a room, wants,
*  you know, rose petals thrown at his feet.
*  He wants everyone to call him sir and be uncomfortable.
*  Yeah, everyone to be uncomfortable because he's a fucking man.
*  You know, and that kind of guy responds very poorly to being mocked. Right.
*  So I think that it was like letting me know, like, hey, bitch,
*  you got a little of that in you.
*  You need to get that out of your system, especially as a person
*  who's a professional mocker.
*  I'm a mocker of things.
*  We are. We are stand up mockers.
*  There's a lot to be mocked.
*  How long does it last for? 15 minutes.
*  That's it. Yes.
*  And what about the micro dosing?
*  That's similar with this video that you're playing.
*  That's it's kind of like that, but way more intense.
*  I don't know how this it's a VR experience called Ayahuasca
*  that you can I don't know how exactly it works.
*  I haven't tried it. Is Ayahuasca different?
*  No, it is and no.
*  See, the thing about Ayahuasca is it lasts longer
*  because it's orally.
*  See, that's that's probably more similar.
*  And you can get there on Ayahuasca and DMT.
*  It's the same thing. It's dimethyltryptamine.
*  It's just when you're taking it with Ayahuasca, your body is processing it
*  orally and you take it with something called an MAO inhibitor.
*  MAO inhibitor, MAO is monoamine oxidase.
*  It's produced by your gut and it processes
*  DMT naturally that exists in plants.
*  So like there's a lot of plants that have DMT in it.
*  And if you just like if you were eating grass, like some sort
*  like Filaris grass or something like that, it's really rich in DMT.
*  So if you were eating, you would get high.
*  You would get high as fuck.
*  But monoamine oxidase that's produced by your gut,
*  it breaks that stuff down.
*  So it's not orally active.
*  So if you ate if you took some DMT that you would free base and just ate it,
*  it wouldn't do anything to you because your gut would break it down.
*  But then if you took it with an MAO inhibitor,
*  preferably the kind of plant based MAO inhibitor
*  that they use in ayahuasca because they know like those MAO inhibitors
*  that people take, like sometimes people take them as a medication.
*  Those can be dangerous.
*  They're they're much more much more potent.
*  And there's also a weird side of I've heard of people taking
*  pharmaceutical MAO inhibitors and then they take mushrooms
*  or something else with them and they really can fuck them up like real bad.
*  Yeah, because they're cross pollinating their fucking drug use.
*  You do all kinds of wacky shit to your brain that your brain is probably not
*  really designed. You're redlining your brain.
*  Your brain may stay together or you might go
*  fucking shine on your crazy diamond.
*  Yeah, yeah, go on. Go off the deep end.
*  Yeah. Have you had any any kind of experience with MDMA or anything?
*  Nothing. Nothing. Pot?
*  Not not good experiences.
*  Even the bad ones are good.
*  I the bad pot experiences teach you that regular life is OK.
*  I hit the the CBD before I go to bed.
*  That's great. With with some THC in it.
*  OK, just a little bit to crash you.
*  Yeah. And I have the fucking weirdest dreams when I'm on them.
*  Oh, for sure. Yeah.
*  Really fucking weird dreams.
*  Just CBD alone.
*  I'm so happy that that stuff's legal for folks with
*  like anyone with arthritis or weird aches and pains.
*  Yeah. Fucking CBD is a game changer.
*  Really, especially the creams.
*  You know, Tyson's one is really good. It's really good.
*  Yeah. Yeah. He gave me a bunch of it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I'll call Mike. I'm like, I need some more.
*  His weed is stupid strong. Yeah.
*  He's got crazy. Well, it should be. Yeah, probably.
*  If you're Mike Tyson, you're better not be fucking weak. Right. Right.
*  You can have Mike Tyson weed.
*  What do you think about him fighting? I
*  I mean, as a listen, I'm friends with him, but I'm also a fan.
*  Yeah. And to see him look how he looks now is exciting.
*  It's crazy. And I talked.
*  You know, it's funny as I talked to him before the video came out of him
*  hitting pads and shit.
*  And we were FaceTiming and I said, Mike, you look good.
*  He goes, yeah, man, I've been boxing, man. I feel really good.
*  And I said, that's that's great.
*  And he goes, yeah, man, I bet I felt in a long time.
*  I even have a fight.
*  I said, what? I go with, yeah, man, I mean, like exhibition or something.
*  You know, you won't work my corner.
*  I was like, yeah, that'll go well, Mike.
*  Fucking something bad happens.
*  Russell Peters fucked up Mike Tyson's.
*  Well, he'll have I'm sure Javier Cordero, who's been working with him.
*  He'll probably have him in his corner. You know? Yeah.
*  There's talk of that John Jones fighting him.
*  No, John's just fucking around.
*  I guarantee John's fucking around.
*  He even said he would fight him in a boxing match as long as Mike would
*  fight him in an MMA fight.
*  You know, he said, but he promised he wouldn't hurt him.
*  He wouldn't break anything on him.
*  Yeah. No, like, listen, the boxer cannot go into an MMA ring.
*  No, not with John.
*  As much as John kicks your legs.
*  Yeah. John, you know, John probably just wrestle him to the ground.
*  Take him down.
*  That's like when James Toney fought Randy Couture.
*  That was a rough one, man.
*  That was a rough one.
*  I kind of knew that James wasn't really training for that, though.
*  He just took the payday.
*  Yeah, he's just I bet he's natural.
*  He's naturally a tough guy. James Toney.
*  Sure. Never been knocked down.
*  You know, that gets you beat up longer.
*  Yeah, it does. It makes your brain get really fucking messy.
*  Yeah. You're scrambling those eggs.
*  Nobody talked better shit during sparring sessions than James Toney.
*  Oh, those are my favorite.
*  There's so many videos and what you got, bitch.
*  That's it. That's all you got.
*  That's all you got. Come on, bitch.
*  I do. I talk shit when I'm rolling with people.
*  Oh, do you? But I talk like funny shit.
*  Oh, like, like it'd be like I'll get, you know, something will happen.
*  I'll lose position or something.
*  Oh, that was a mistake.
*  You know, and then and I'll do anything I can to fuck with their mood,
*  like to make them laugh. So it throws them off.
*  OK. Even with Jack, I do it.
*  You know, I remember that when I'm rolling with John Jack, I'll be like,
*  you were made for hitchhiking, not your Jetson.
*  You see the people in the class like, oh, my God.
*  I'm like, we're friends. We're good.
*  John Jack's the godfather of my of my son.
*  Is he really? Yeah.
*  He's a great person. He is a great guy.
*  He really is. I feel real lucky that I met him.
*  You know, you could run into any Jiu-Jitsu instructor.
*  I just stumbled upon him because it was closer to my area.
*  You know, closer to my house.
*  And then he turns out to be one of the best ever.
*  One of the best ever.
*  And just so technical, too, like just the way he breaks things down
*  and his ego so healthy, like he's like real easy to roll with.
*  And yeah. And he's a rare guy that's like 50 years old.
*  It still rolls all the time. Doesn't get hurt.
*  Doesn't get hurt. Kind of amazing.
*  I think he hurt his knee for a little bit, but it's gotten better, I think.
*  Yeah. Meniscus tear.
*  Yeah. He never had to get it operated on.
*  That's good. Oh, really? Yeah.
*  How did he fix it?
*  I don't know. Just healed, I guess.
*  He went to the doctor and he said it's fine now.
*  That's amazing. Yeah. How's your shoulder?
*  Everything's good, man.
*  It's all good. When my finger's better, we'll roll again.
*  Yeah. What's wrong with your finger?
*  I fucking this middle one, I jammed it.
*  Oh, I got swept by Mark Armstrong.
*  And I went to post.
*  And when I went to post, instead of my hand hitting like this,
*  my finger went straight.
*  Have you ever used tape on it?
*  Like, you know what?
*  You know, it's funny is I usually have those.
*  Finger grips. Yeah.
*  The fucking ones that I use.
*  But you know what you could do is you take athletic tape
*  and you tape two fingers together to protect it.
*  Well, I usually have those on. Oh, OK.
*  The Luta gear. Yeah.
*  I usually have it on.
*  And that fucking one day I didn't wear it. Oh.
*  I don't know why I didn't wear it that day.
*  And then that's the fucking day I did it.
*  Yeah. If you jam one, you can.
*  I jam both of these. Oh, yeah.
*  This one's fine now, but this one's still really sort of like
*  I'm holding a cup of coffee and it hurts because this angle, you know?
*  Yeah. Just tape them all up.
*  So if you tape them all up, it'd almost be like you have like one grip.
*  OK. It's all you need anyway.
*  You know, like you very rarely use like individual. Yeah.
*  No, no. Yeah. Just tape them all up.
*  Tape them together.
*  Get some of that white athletic tape or they have jiu jitsu tape.
*  Like I think it's called monkey tape.
*  Monkey grip. See if you find that shit.
*  Monkey grip tape.
*  It's probably so that that's strong.
*  Fight supply store. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
*  But yeah, I mean, a lot of guys like that was Hickson was famous for that.
*  You go to see and he's always injured because he was constantly rolling.
*  So he had tape all over.
*  Yeah. Hickson's back is fucked and his knees.
*  And it's real bad.
*  Eddie's got bad knees, though, doesn't he? Yep. Yep.
*  Yeah, there is. Yeah. Monkey tape. That's it.
*  So that's tape just specifically designed for jiu jitsu.
*  The monkey tape mafia. Yeah.
*  Yeah, I should get that. Good stuff.
*  I do need it. It looks really thin like.
*  Yeah, but that's also so you can move it around the joints, you know, and,
*  you know, it's still solid.
*  Look, they know what they're doing.
*  They have they have thick stuff, too.
*  But a lot of guys like that thin stuff because you can get in between
*  the fingers real good and tape it up. Nice.
*  I'm going to get that zebra pack.
*  There you go.
*  Get a little white.
*  Go back. Yeah, I need that done.
*  Yeah, fucking that hurt. That shit hurt. I screamed.
*  Yeah, it hurts.
*  That's the thing about jiu jitsu you're going to have to deal with.
*  You're going to get injured.
*  Yeah. And then one day I was rolling and I I don't know, my fucking my foot
*  or ankle cramped and it just started to turn on its own.
*  The muscle spasm. Oh, no.
*  My ankle was turning in on itself.
*  And it was like, did you break his ankle?
*  I can't fucking stop my foot. It's just the turning.
*  Just a cramp. A cramp.
*  But the muscle spasm in the man.
*  It's kept turning in and like the fucking exorcist.
*  I used to get cramps and then I started taking electrolytes like regularly.
*  Every day. I think that's what I need to do.
*  Changed everything. Liquid IV.
*  It's one of my sponsors. I'll give you some.
*  Yeah, I have some here.
*  Dude, changed my changed everything to complete game changer.
*  Yeah, because I used to get cramps.
*  I used to get cramps when I was working out.
*  I just thought it was part of working out.
*  But then I started drinking this stuff in my water before I work out.
*  During my workouts.
*  I drink it after I get out of the sauna.
*  I get the cramp in the back of the hamstring there.
*  Sometimes in the calf. Dude, electrolytes are everything.
*  It's so, so important for your body.
*  You know, because hydration and electrolytes.
*  Sometimes I'm trying to, you know, I put somebody in a body lock or something.
*  And then I'm and then I can't hold it because I get a cramp like fuck.
*  Yeah. The same cramp you get when you're fucking, you know, that one.
*  Oh, that one. Yeah.
*  That the fuck cramp. The toe one.
*  Ah, yeah. Yeah. The bottom of the foot.
*  Yikes. Yeah, the toe is the.
*  I hate that shit.
*  Yeah. Cramps are rough, but you can you could do something about that.
*  And it's pretty quick.
*  Like, you know, you take that stuff for a few days and your cramps will go away.
*  You can work out real hard and never get cramps again.
*  I'm definitely going to take some off you.
*  Yeah, it's potassium.
*  I mean, the the one that I like liquid.
*  Well, there's a bunch of really good ones, but liquid IV is one of my sponsors.
*  And it's got all kinds of great shit in B vitamins. Potassium tastes good, too.
*  Flavor they got a bunch of different flavors.
*  They got acai is like for the Brazilians.
*  Yes. My friend, Poha.
*  Oh, did I ever tell you that story? Which one?
*  I think one time after I did one of your podcasts, a guy hits me up on Instagram
*  was like, hey, so excited that you're doing Jiu Jitsu, man.
*  I make mouth guards. I want to make you a personal mouth guard.
*  That's great, man. He goes, what do you want on it?
*  I go, oh, I know exactly what I want on it.
*  So I tell him what I want. And he sends it. Poha.
*  I get I get to the Academy and I go, JJ, I got a mouth guard.
*  He goes, good, you're going to need it.
*  And then I put it in and I got the mat and I smile.
*  And he goes, ha, why do you want cum in your mouth?
*  I go, what? He goes, poha, it means cum.
*  I go, why do you say it all the time?
*  It doesn't mean it when we say it, but that's actually what it means.
*  Like, it means a bunch of things.
*  Yeah, but the actual word means common.
*  I'm like, oh, fuck, I never wore the thing again.
*  But it means different things like like Gilbert Burns,
*  who's fighting Kamaru Usman for the title.
*  He always yells it after he wins.
*  He wins. He yells, poha.
*  Yeah, because they they use it like that.
*  But it means different things.
*  But it's the same way Malaka means jerk off in in Greek.
*  But they'll say to a Malaka, what are you doing?
*  Hey, how you been, Malaka?
*  It's like that's like a Joey Diaz thing.
*  You call your jerk off. Yeah, jerk off.
*  Yeah, it's the same thing.
*  But yeah, but it doesn't mean it.
*  You know what I mean?
*  But the actual meaning of this apparently is fucking common.
*  He's like he's laughing hysterically.
*  You ever seen Jack laugh like that?
*  It's pretty fucking funny.
*  Hey, why don't you go put the comeback in your?
*  Oh, that's a lot of the guys listening who made me the mouthpiece.
*  Can you make me another one that just says my name?
*  Just deal with it. Just deal with common your mouth.
*  That's a big deal, bro. Girls been dealing with it for years.
*  You know, just handle it like a fucking gentleman.
*  Yeah. Who's who made your mouth guard?
*  I forgot the name.
*  Oh, there's a guy, the mouthpiece guy makes dope shit.
*  I wonder if that was a fit perfectly.
*  This one didn't fit perfectly, though.
*  Oh, OK. Because it was like it was a spec, I guess.
*  You know, you just a spec, a spec one.
*  It was like, hey, he didn't measure me or nothing.
*  So, oh, you know, they got to they have to do the mouth print, though.
*  I had one of those before from boxing.
*  Yeah. And I left that at my old guy.
*  I was training without here. I left it at his gym years ago.
*  I don't think I want it back now. No, no.
*  You need a new one.
*  But what they'll do for like a guy who makes professional ones
*  like the mouthpiece guy makes them for a lot of MMA guys.
*  It's like you have this thing that you sit sit your teeth like a dentist.
*  We think nasty. Yes, it's nasty.
*  And then it'll form and then, you know, they'll put the
*  make a top and bottom one or they can make a top and bottom one.
*  Yeah. What do you like?
*  I like just the top one for jujitsu, but for striking,
*  I'd like a top and bottom one. Yeah.
*  Because I do need it now because I find I'm grinding my teeth when I'm rolling.
*  Yeah. It's hard to breathe out of your nose,
*  but there's a lot of real benefit to breathing out of your nose.
*  There really is.
*  You know, sometimes you're going to breathe out of your mouth,
*  but there's real benefit to primarily breathing out of your nose.
*  And I'm reading a book now.
*  I think James Nestor. It's
*  it is a book that's about. Yeah, sure.
*  Get in there, son.
*  It's a book that yeah, it's called Breath.
*  And it's by this guy, James Nestor.
*  And I've been reading it for listening to it on audiobook.
*  How's your is your nose broken at all?
*  Yes, but I got it fixed.
*  I got it fixed in like 10 years ago and it made a huge difference.
*  Mine is still broken.
*  So you can't breathe out of it. Well, not properly.
*  Get it fixed, man.
*  I want to know why you're on lockdown.
*  This now is what I thought.
*  But they're like, no, can't do that right now.
*  That's elective, right? Oh, but I think they can do elective surgeries now.
*  I think there's some you know, I know that you're right.
*  You know what you're doing? OK, little struggling and fucking struggling.
*  Need some help? Yeah, go ahead, Joe.
*  Get your fucking monkey grips all over it, that kid.
*  Jesus Christ, Rambo, I didn't think you'd pull that fucking thing out.
*  Tuck a more custom knives in the house.
*  You also have the best shit. So dope.
*  Every time you post something, you go, so fucking cool,
*  like the fridge you posted the other day.
*  Yeah, that's kill cliff.
*  You got to try those things, man. CBD drinks.
*  Get your 25 milligrams of CBD with each each little serving there, fella.
*  Does do anything? Yeah.
*  CBD is fucking great, period.
*  You get as much of it as you can.
*  See, for me, 100 milligrams at a time. Really?
*  For me, it equates sleep for me now.
*  It does that to alleviate anxiety.
*  But it's really good for people that have joint issues.
*  Really good for people with arthritis.
*  I used to have really bad arthritis in my fingers.
*  It seems to be gone away.
*  I've been taking these curcumin pills. Oh, OK.
*  They curcumin, curcumin.
*  That's turmeric. Same thing. Yeah.
*  This one apparently the curcumin is 500 times more absorbent,
*  like faster absorbency. That makes sense.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of natural things for inflammation.
*  But the big one is avoiding things that cause inflammation.
*  Like with your diet, like get rid of bread, take bread and pasta out of your diet.
*  So many of your little aches and pains go away.
*  I don't really have many aches and pains anymore.
*  It's kind of nice. That's awesome. Yeah.
*  Are you doing just jujitsu or do you do like you supplement it
*  with any calisthenics or weightlifting or anything?
*  Well, no, I just do jujitsu and then I ride my bike now.
*  Oh, that's cool. It's for these like five mile bike rides.
*  Around your neighborhood or something? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I got that motor assist one, so it's kind of nice.
*  The power system.
*  No, it's good because those fucking hills in my community are killer, dude.
*  Can't handle the hills? No, hell no.
*  That's where it's supposed to. It's where you're supposed to work.
*  You still have to work.
*  It's not like it's pedaling for you. Oh, I know.
*  I got a buddy of mine who has one. I love that bike. It's awesome.
*  They're fine. OK.
*  It's better to have a regular bike. Don't suffer.
*  Yeah, I'll take, you know, I'll wait till it gets too easy
*  and then I'll step it up from there.
*  You know, you just get one kettlebell.
*  You get one. I've got one.
*  I think I don't know if you sent it to me on it sent it to me.
*  OK, they sent me the Ironman one. OK, beautiful.
*  Yeah, it's good. That's a good one.
*  It's 45 pounds. It's a good size.
*  And they sent me one of those two of those jugglers bats.
*  Those are fucking deadly heavy. Yeah, those are great.
*  I got weak wrists, so that shit hurts when I do.
*  They're really good for your shoulders, really good for your forearms.
*  Grip strength, all that stuff. Yeah.
*  Yeah, we have a bunch of
*  programs that John Wolf, the head fitness instructor on it, put together
*  for during this quarantine, so people could work out at home
*  with minimal equipment, these home workouts for six weeks.
*  They beg, get on that, buddy.
*  Well, I was dropping good weight off the jujitsu. Yeah.
*  Jujitsu plus stress equals weight loss for me, really.
*  Regardless of what you eat.
*  Yeah, I I went from when I started back at jujitsu was 240 pounds,
*  which is fucking huge.
*  You got big, huh? Fat. You saw me.
*  You knew I was fat, but you're just too fucking nice to say it.
*  I'm not nice to everybody. I know.
*  Well, listen, you know what?
*  I don't know that because I've only seen you be nice to people,
*  except for a couple of times I've seen some rando stranger end up in the green room.
*  You're like, dude, you got to get the fuck out of here.
*  You know, but I'm a big fish. Yeah, that's fine.
*  Thank you. Can get the fuck out of my green room now.
*  Get out of the green room.
*  Well, there's a few of those guys who made it to the back of the main room.
*  Yeah. They were just walked back there.
*  And then they would like ask for stuff and you'd be like, who is this guy?
*  Yeah. What are you doing here? Yeah. Yeah.
*  But that's the old days.
*  The comedy store is pretty tightened down or was before COVID tightened down with security.
*  I'm wondering when they're going to open up again, man.
*  Well, I when they were talking September, weren't they late September, early October?
*  So they're saying now.
*  Well, that's that's what I had heard before this double lockdown.
*  Jesus Christ. Speaking of lockdown, that's what you tried to do to me when we rolled.
*  Yes. And I tapped on the way to it.
*  Well, you had me in a calf slicer.
*  No, you thought it was a calf slicer.
*  Well, you know who thought it was a calf slicer?
*  My fucking calf thought it was a calf slicer.
*  Joseph, I was just using I was going into a twister roll.
*  I was going to put you in a twist. Yeah. Why would you do that?
*  You know, you're nice to me, but why would you want to twist me like that?
*  It does not have had.
*  It's not that bad for the guy doing it. It's not that bad.
*  I've been caught in a twister multiple times.
*  Oh, just you. You tapped in the roll.
*  That's what happened. Yeah.
*  It was my calf. I was like, ah, but that's probably because you need electrolytes.
*  Probably what it is.
*  Or maybe I don't need a fucking shin.
*  Your bitch ass shins, by the way, on my fucking calf.
*  You just need to know how to defend it.
*  You can't you can't let me roll you in that way.
*  Well, now, I mean, now I probably have better defense for it.
*  It's a natural instinct, really.
*  It's like what people don't want to do is give up their back. Right.
*  So if you're inside control in a person, what they don't want to do
*  is give up their backs. So they don't want to roll away from you.
*  So they roll towards you. Right.
*  But when they roll towards you, you take that top leg, which would be their left
*  leg, and I lace my left leg over and under and I lock it down.
*  Then I sit up and I roll towards your butt.
*  And then as I roll towards your butt, it spins you and I wind up on your back.
*  Yes. And I remember.
*  Remember clearly. That's Eddie Bravo.
*  That's all Eddie Bravo. Fucking Eddie.
*  Yeah. He's trying to figure out different ways to get to the back
*  and get to the twister and then get to there's a bunch of leg locks
*  you can do from those positions, too.
*  I'm not a leg locker. Yeah, that's it.
*  Looks like Eddie and Andrew Schultz.
*  It does look like Andrew Schultz, but it's not.
*  That's Henner Gracie.
*  And I saw Henner Gracie on my Instagram feed selling sweatshirts.
*  Yeah, he made up his own sweatshirt.
*  It's kind of a cool idea.
*  Yeah, it becomes a backpack.
*  Yeah, like folds up into a backpack and it's like if you're on the go,
*  I kind of get it.
*  I mean, I don't see it. Yeah.
*  I mean, like I've never been in that desperate
*  where I'm like, fuck, this sweatshirt is killing me.
*  What am I doing? Yeah. You have no son of a bitch.
*  You don't have a car or a hotel room or something.
*  You know, give it to somebody. Hey, you cold?
*  Do you look chilly? You want to wear this?
*  Wrap it around your neck.
*  It's a big deal. Tie it around your waist.
*  I. Oh, fuck.
*  Oh, did you ever download that mix I sent you?
*  What makes I sent you a metal mix, like an 80s metal mix.
*  It's actually really dope.
*  Why did you do this?
*  How long in December sent it to you when we were having dinner?
*  I said, John, I'm an email it to you.
*  Dude, I my brain is so foggy.
*  You'd really like it.
*  Whatever happened from December on, you still probably in your inbox somewhere.
*  Probably. I'll go find it.
*  But what is it?
*  It's a buddy of mine, Scotty Fox, is a DJ, and he does.
*  He's really dope, really well put together mix tapes. Yeah.
*  And it's not like a lot of there's no scratching.
*  It's just like really well programmed and mixed to the point where you're like
*  that flowed from beginning to end fucking incredibly.
*  You are big into being a DJ in 35 years.
*  Are you doing any of that while you're in lockdown?
*  Are you having like little parties at your house or anything?
*  No, I go on live every now and then and DJ for a little bit.
*  But Instagram locks shuts people out when they're playing music
*  and they try to claim they do.
*  Yeah, dude, they kick you off and they say you violated copyrights.
*  And did you see the RZA and DJ Premiere when they did?
*  How awesome was that? That was fucking amazing.
*  And I love both of them.
*  But I really feel like Primo.
*  Went easy on RZA.
*  Oh, my goodness. I do.
*  Is that what you really think?
*  I do. Listen, I'm friends with both of them, but what are you trying to say?
*  I'm trying to say that
*  Primo had a lot more ammo in his fucking arsenal that he didn't use.
*  I didn't understand it was a true battle.
*  I thought it was just a performance.
*  No, a battle.
*  It's a battle song for song.
*  And it's like, oh, you got that. I got this.
*  And then RZA did pull out something and I'm embarrassed
*  that I didn't fucking know he produced it.
*  It was Long Kiss Good Night by Biggie.
*  I didn't know if RZA did that beat.
*  I didn't know that either.
*  And I was like, fuck, that's one of my favorite Biggie songs.
*  It was just cool because you were watching these two hip hop legends
*  that were making the most of the pandemic.
*  You know, they were in the middle of this weird thing where everybody's at home.
*  And so you knew so many people, like millions of people were watching live.
*  Yeah, well, Swiss Beat started that, the versus thing.
*  And then they did Teddy Riley versus Babyface, which was incredible as well.
*  The first one was hilarious.
*  I didn't I didn't get a chance to watch the Jada fabulous one yet.
*  The fucking Beanie Man versus Bounty Killer was incredible.
*  What is this page, Jamie?
*  It's a versus.
*  Yeah, it turned into a whole platform and brand.
*  And now it's like it might even be a show and they're linked to Apple.
*  And what is the name?
*  But go back up so we can see that.
*  With a Z versus the RZU Z TV versus versus TV versus.
*  It's so and so versus versus versus.
*  And how many followers they have on this one point nine.
*  It's crazy. Well, you know, it's fun how things arise from necessity,
*  from things like COVID.
*  Like we're talking about Andrew Schultz created that COVID comedy.
*  Like he's doing these videos and it arrived from not being able to create
*  and do stand up. Well, he you know, he was he was already on the way
*  to setting up that studio that he has. Yes.
*  And then he it just fucking, you know, perfect timing, perfect timing.
*  And the kid's incredible. I'm a fan.
*  I'm a big fan of him before before all of that. I was a fan.
*  Yeah, he's a hustler.
*  He's a hustler. He's really fucking good.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Not mad at that guy's success at all.
*  But I feel that he should have way more success than he has.
*  He's got a lot of success and will have more. He will.
*  But he's the future. Yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah, there's a there's a good crop.
*  There's a good crop of up and coming guys. Yeah.
*  I just love the fact that people make lemonade.
*  You know, they figure out a way like, OK, what what can I do here?
*  Yeah, I got some lemons.
*  This ain't good. But let's let's figure out how to make this.
*  This is really sour. What should we do with this? Yeah. Yeah.
*  And that's something that, you know, you don't always see from people.
*  There's a lot of woe is me guys, you know, when when the shit hits the fan.
*  And yeah, I you know, I feel a woe to myself sometimes,
*  but I'm also very aware that I am the reason I'm woeing.
*  Yeah, even when I text you, I'm like, you know, you know, that sucks.
*  And I go, it's my fault, Joe. Yeah.
*  I'm all about accountability, you know. You are.
*  Yeah. And your fault is your fault.
*  Yeah. You can't you can't pass the buck.
*  No matter what situation you're in in your life, you fucking got yourself there.
*  Sometimes it's good to go through that shit, though, right?
*  It's a personal growth moment.
*  Absolutely. Opportunity for you to recalibrate.
*  I think I used to be a pussy hound.
*  And yeah, I know you.
*  But not anymore. That's for sure.
*  I got fucking PTSD, dude.
*  I'm not fucking literally.
*  TSD from pussy. Yeah.
*  I'm literally like, you know what? I'm good.
*  I got Pornhub. I'm quite happy with that. My selections.
*  I know how to love myself.
*  Well, we're getting heavy here, bro.
*  We got to do something.
*  There was dead moments and it's my fault.
*  What are you going to do?
*  It's hard, man.
*  Good cigars. They're good, right? Yeah.
*  Shout out to Mike Binder.
*  Like Mike Binder, such a good guy.
*  I'm looking forward to that doc when it comes out.
*  It's going to be interesting, you know, because it details
*  so many generations and so many different versions of the store,
*  you know, from the very early days in the 70s to what was really the last,
*  you know, the last few years was this incredible boom that was unprecedented.
*  By the way, I mentioned you in that one when I was doing the interview, I said
*  he said, what do you think is the one of the reasons for the Renaissance
*  here at the Comedy Stone? I said, I'll be honest, I think it's Joe Rogan.
*  Joe Rogan came here, came back, and he brought a lot of people with him.
*  And he swears by this place.
*  And I said, I really don't think it would be what it is without him.
*  That's very nice. Well, it's true.
*  Well, I wouldn't just say it to say it, but I said it.
*  I appreciate that. It's a fact.
*  Well, it became, you know, a better place.
*  You know, when Adam was running it then and then, you know, like Adam.
*  Yeah. Despite a lot of people don't like Adam.
*  Right. He's great. I've known him for a long time.
*  I had him on the podcast. You know, he used to be a cult.
*  Did he really? Oh, you know, his parents and him, right?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. He grew up.
*  That's fucking weird. I grew up in a cult.
*  Yeah. I didn't really realize it.
*  No, I guess you wouldn't because you didn't know anything else. Right.
*  What cult was this?
*  What was it called again? Do you remember?
*  Branch Davidians.
*  Speaking of Texas. Yeah.
*  It was something along those lines.
*  Waco is always going to be that place now.
*  Like even no matter what. Yeah. Yeah.
*  See, do see, do right. Yeah.
*  You know who grew up in an ashram was Abby.
*  You know, Abby Robearish? No.
*  You know, he's at the store. Young kid. OK.
*  Nice kid. He grew up in an ashram. Wow.
*  What the fuck? That's heavy.
*  So his parents were Buddhists.
*  Yeah, like hippie type, you know.
*  Oh, wow. He's not even old enough to have hippie parents.
*  So it's kind of weird. Wow.
*  But he was telling me that he goes, yeah, I grew up in an ashram.
*  He could any age, you could be old enough to have hippie parents.
*  Yeah, I suppose. Especially in this day and age.
*  There's a lot of kids up there right now that are growing up with hippie parents.
*  This is a new age. Renaissance hippies. Yeah.
*  But there's so many of them online now.
*  They find these little communities and they connect with each other.
*  There's too much out there. There's too much.
*  Too many weirdos can connect with other weirdos. Yeah.
*  Is that bad, though?
*  It's good and bad. It's a double edged sword.
*  I think it's good.
*  It's good that they found somebody.
*  Remember, like George Carlin used to say, I think we should, you know,
*  the homeless people you see on the street talking to each other, talking to themselves,
*  they should pair them up so at least they look like they're talking to each other.
*  I think that the possible good things outweigh the possible bad things.
*  I think they get together and maybe they can improve each other.
*  Maybe they can grow together.
*  Being by yourself, if you're a hippie by yourself, you're fucked.
*  If you're doing anything by yourself, it's not good.
*  Yeah. Well, that's one.
*  That's why when I see like the homeless people under the bridge and they see them together,
*  I'm like, well, I mean, it sucks, but at least you're not alone in this.
*  You know, right.
*  If you had a measurement of happiness scale, you know, I bet some of them
*  are probably happier than people that work constantly. Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, what what actually makes you happy?
*  And it also depends on which makes you miserable. Yeah.
*  What which part of this don't you like?
*  In fact, you know, being alone is a big one.
*  Being alone makes you very miserable. Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm quite happy being alone right now, but.
*  But that's a different situation. Different situation.
*  You're like you're you like being alone because it's better than wishing you were alone.
*  Yes. I'm not alone by force.
*  I'm alone by choice. Yeah.
*  That's probably the worst is wishing you were alone.
*  Like being with someone who you wish you weren't with is worse than being alone.
*  Yes, because you feel alone.
*  You know what's really fucked up?
*  It's like it's very difficult to figure out how do you get back
*  if you're with someone you don't want to be with anymore.
*  It's very difficult to figure out how do you get back to where you were
*  when you enjoyed them? Is that possible?
*  Can you do that?
*  Some people know it needs to be both of you. Yes.
*  That want to go back. Yes.
*  And it's never there's, you know, one of you is going to hang on to something.
*  Yes. And you're both going to hang on to different parts of something.
*  And that's what's going to stop the reversal of fortune.
*  That's why you got to do mushrooms together.
*  All right. Do you have? Yes.
*  Give me some before I go. OK.
*  And I'll take a little microdose. We'll see what's up at my leisure.
*  I'm going to call you when I'm about to do it, though.
*  Yeah. Call. Well, I'll walk you through it.
*  Do it on a night that I'm not going anywhere. OK.
*  I'll stay on the phone with you. I'll come to your house.
*  It'll be a strange conversation about an hour in.
*  You know, you should just come to my house and hang out in the backyard. OK.
*  It's not far from you. I'll be your babysitter.
*  That'd be great. OK.
*  I couldn't ask for a better babysitter.
*  That's what you got to do sometimes.
*  They actually call it a sitter. Yeah.
*  Yeah. When someone does psychedelics, the other person will be a sitter.
*  Yeah, because I can't trust Eddie, my assistant.
*  You're fucking not a fool.
*  I said to go, I had to make a phone call.
*  I'm like, well, why am I in the fucking pool upside down?
*  Who told you to go in the pool?
*  The fucking voice in my head told me to go in the pool.
*  The voice you had not going to tell you go in the pool.
*  It's going to tell you to lie down in the grass and just relax.
*  Stare up at the sky. It's going to be OK until it's not OK anymore.
*  And then it's not going to matter.
*  And then what?
*  Then you go into the next stage of existence.
*  How much how long do the micro dosing last?
*  Micro dosing is easy.
*  It's you barely notice it's happening.
*  The thing about true micro dosing is you're supposed to take it at
*  really almost like sub perceptible levels.
*  So you're taking it at a level where it's like you just barely get
*  like a tiny rise from it.
*  And for many people, you know, Ron White is into that.
*  It's fucking Ron White makes me laugh. Yeah.
*  Dude, he has no clue half the time what's happening.
*  He's the best.
*  I remember one night I dropped him home from the comedy store.
*  He was we're there. Everybody's drinking.
*  I don't know if you know, he has drinks every now and then.
*  And I was I was feeling good.
*  He was feeling good.
*  And he came outside. He's like, I got to get home.
*  Who can drive me? Can somebody call me an Uber?
*  And I go, I'll get you home, Ron.
*  He goes, are you going to drive? You're drunk.
*  I go, no, I'm not. My buddy will drive my car.
*  All right, let's go.
*  And I realized he gets in the front.
*  You get in the front, Ron.
*  I sat in the back seat of my car.
*  My buddy drives. I go, where do you live?
*  Go to Beverly Hills.
*  So he takes us gets us to his house.
*  And he's like, all right, thanks, folks.
*  Hey, you want to come in and see what comedy can buy you?
*  And I'm like, in my head at that moment, I went,
*  he doesn't realize it's me.
*  And I go, yeah, sure, I'll come in.
*  So I go in his house. He goes, yeah, that's it.
*  It's all comedy. And I go, nice.
*  And in my head, I'm thinking, my house is bigger than this.
*  Right. And then he goes.
*  And his girlfriend walks in and goes, hey, honey, this is
*  I'm sorry, but I forgot your name.
*  And she goes, oh, my God, Russell Peters.
*  And he goes like this. Ah, fuck.
*  He was that drunk. He forgot your name.
*  He forgot he didn't recognize me.
*  I don't know what it was.
*  As soon as you heard me, because, ah, fuck.
*  Oh, my God, that's blitzed.
*  I thought it was pretty hilarious.
*  That's a high level of blitzed.
*  They call me, man.
*  Just see, there's my number. Give me a call.
*  By the way, the worst Ron White impression I think I've ever heard.
*  Possibly.
*  Liz, here's what comedy can buy you.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  It was my it was my he's a character from a movie.
*  He is. He's really fucking funny guy, too.
*  Oh, he's ridiculously funny.
*  I've been on flights with him and he didn't.
*  I sat like in the he was on the other aisle across from me.
*  And I didn't even say anything to him.
*  He didn't look right at me.
*  He didn't recognize me again.
*  I'm like, last time he did this podcast, we were talking and I go,
*  how often do you fucked up?
*  He's like every fucking night.
*  I go, you get drunk every night.
*  He was every fucking night.
*  We had this conversation afterwards.
*  I was like, you don't take any days off.
*  No, I don't think his liver would accept him taking a night off.
*  But you imagine getting drunk every night and he doesn't look bad.
*  No. For a guy. Great fucking hair.
*  Good hair is amazing. Great.
*  I got fucking hair envy.
*  And he's a killer.
*  Like on stage, he's a fucking killer.
*  Like it doesn't affect his stand up.
*  In fact, it probably enhances it.
*  And the guy's been doing it forever.
*  Yeah, I'm what, 31 in your 31 in, aren't you?
*  Yeah. How do you tell a guy like that to change it up?
*  You can't because it's not a problem.
*  He's a functioning alcoholic.
*  He's living in Austin now.
*  Is he really? Yep.
*  Wow. So everybody knows where you're going.
*  Nobody will hear this. Don't worry about it.
*  We're going to be fine. Keep it on the DL.
*  You think you're going to stay here, though?
*  You're going to stay here. I have no choice.
*  Talk those broads into moving.
*  I can't. It will cost me a fortune
*  that I do not have right now.
*  Podcasts. You need to get that.
*  I should. Russell Peters podcast rolling.
*  What would you call it?
*  I don't know. What would you call it?
*  The Russell Peters show.
*  Sure. Why not?
*  It doesn't need another name.
*  Everybody wants to come up with these fucking,
*  like Brian Callan had mixed mental arts for a while.
*  Exactly. Exactly.
*  Me and Chob were torturing them.
*  We were like, what are you doing?
*  I was just with Brian at Frank Grillo's birthday
*  at Frank Grillo's place.
*  It was like ...
*  You see he's got his eyelids done?
*  Yeah, I couldn't tell.
*  Yeah, nobody can tell.
*  He looked like he got the fuck beat out of him
*  for about three days. Now he looks normal.
*  Yeah, he did have kind of like a purpley thing under.
*  I thought he was from sparring or something.
*  From vanity.
*  And I think Gerard Butler was there that night.
*  Wow. Gerard Butler's a really nice guy.
*  He's a good guy.
*  I met him at a few UFCs. Super nice guy.
*  And at the end of the night, I said to Brian, I go,
*  well, you killed tonight, man.
*  You won tonight's party, that's for sure.
*  Oh, he's great at a party.
*  Oh yeah, he's great.
*  He's one of the best guys for being funny
*  in groups of people.
*  Because that's when he comes alive.
*  Like if he never did stand up again,
*  but he just went to dinner every night, he'd be fine.
*  Yeah, he could be a professional guest.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  Yeah, a professional dinner guest.
*  Hey, listen, this dinner might be boring.
*  How much is Callan charged for dinner?
*  Dude, the first time I ever went hunting,
*  I went hunting with Callan.
*  Me and him and Steve Rinell and the Meat Eater crew,
*  we went to Montana and it was seven days of hysterics.
*  It was like one long shit dick or gay joke.
*  It was just him being-
*  No, dude, let's just make out, yeah.
*  Yeah, exactly. That's the whole thing.
*  Like, what would you do right now
*  if I just started sucking your cock?
*  Just me sucking your cock.
*  He's just such a,
*  you know, like people think about comedians,
*  oh, they're on all the time.
*  That's so annoying.
*  It's not annoying with Callan.
*  No, he knows how to do it properly.
*  Well, it's a different kind of on.
*  It's Brian Callan on.
*  Like, yeah, he'd be a great professional dinner guest.
*  You know how people do cameo?
*  Yeah.
*  You know, they pay to get-
*  I do cameo.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone pays you to do like a little shout out.
*  Matter of fact, I have one I have to do when I'm done here.
*  Let's do it real quick.
*  But with Callan, like Callan should do that,
*  but with dinner guests.
*  He should be a dinner guest.
*  I bet you he can make a fucking fortune.
*  Oh, for sure.
*  How many rich guys would love to hang out with Callan?
*  Yeah, and even if they don't know him,
*  once they get him, they're like,
*  oh yeah, because I saw Gerard Butler go,
*  yeah, we need to hang out.
*  And I'm like, I hang out too, man.
*  I didn't say shit all night.
*  I shut up in a lot of those situations
*  because I'm like, I'm watching everything.
*  I'm always like, what's going on in here?
*  But when a lot of people are talking,
*  there's nothing wrong with shutting up.
*  It's fun.
*  Yeah, you don't learn when you talk,
*  you learn when you listen.
*  So that's what I was trying to do.
*  Yeah, look at you, wise man.
*  You should write that down somewhere
*  and put it on an Instagram page.
*  I read it somewhere.
*  Motivational quotes.
*  I miss Jack Handy quotes.
*  Those are my favorite.
*  Jack Handy?
*  Remember Jack Handy from SNL?
*  No.
*  It would always be like a Hallmark kind of quote.
*  It'd be like, it takes a big man to cry,
*  but it takes an even bigger man
*  to laugh at that man who's crying.
*  Stuff like that.
*  You pull those up there?
*  Nothing has been better for those kind of things
*  on the internet.
*  Oh yeah, that's the thing now.
*  Oh yeah, you see people fucking write one line like,
*  fuck that, it would've been a great bit,
*  now I can't do it,
*  because this fucking idiot posted this.
*  Yeah, and it's also just that memes on the internet
*  is a different style of comedy.
*  It's like a whole new kind of comedy
*  that didn't exist before.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, when something goes wrong,
*  like little memes.
*  Those are my favorite.
*  They're fucking great.
*  I like, I screenshot them,
*  and then I sent them to my brother.
*  I sent one today to him, I think.
*  There was one I saw that said,
*  my wife's gone into labor,
*  I called the hospital,
*  my wife's gone into labor, what should I do?
*  Is this her first child?
*  No, this is her husband.
*  Blah, blah, blah.
*  I love dumb shit like that, though.
*  You're a throwback.
*  I'm old school.
*  That's a Jeff Ross type.
*  I spoke to Jeff last night.
*  How's he doing?
*  He's doing good.
*  Yeah, he's doing good.
*  I love Jeff.
*  He's such a sweet guy.
*  Everybody's in suspended animation.
*  Everybody.
*  The only thing that's been connecting me to everybody
*  is doing this.
*  Being able to sit down with guys,
*  shoot the shit with them,
*  other than last weekend with Tony and Moses
*  when we went to Houston.
*  That felt like the old days again.
*  It was crazy.
*  You did the Houston improv?
*  Yeah.
*  I was there.
*  It was my first time ever there.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Stage is really high.
*  It's great.
*  It's a great club.
*  I like it.
*  I like it a lot.
*  It was really fun.
*  What was capacity, 50, 75?
*  They were up to 75.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, 75%.
*  I think that's what they were doing in Miami, too.
*  It was pretty packed.
*  Yeah, it looked full.
*  So, Chrysler's on the road, right?
*  And he's doing drive-in movie theaters.
*  I saw that.
*  He's got Jesus with him.
*  Yes, and in between,
*  and he did the drive-in with Miss Pat as well.
*  Hilarious.
*  Yeah, I love Miss Pat.
*  She's great.
*  In between, he did some clubs,
*  and he did a club in Oklahoma.
*  It was supposed to be 120 seats, socially distanced.
*  They stuffed 343 people in there.
*  Hilarious.
*  And they lied to him about the number.
*  So, Jesus went around counting heads,
*  and he counted 343 people in there.
*  Like, that count was grossly inaccurate.
*  Wow.
*  I have my assistant count the club, too,
*  and I'm like, Eddie, go count every fucking seat.
*  Every seat.
*  He's got a ticker on his phone.
*  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
*  I don't wanna be fucking short-changed by there,
*  because I'm already getting short-changed.
*  The money's bad now.
*  Yeah.
*  The money's less, they're charging less.
*  But in their Burt situation,
*  Burt was worried about catching COVID.
*  He's like, look, man,
*  I did drive-in movie theaters for a reason
*  so that I would be away from everybody.
*  They're in their car, I'm over here, everybody's safe.
*  And he's like, now I'm in this club.
*  He goes, I don't feel safe at all.
*  He goes, this is not good.
*  They just stuffed it, dude.
*  I'll show you a picture.
*  Send me a picture of it.
*  It's fucking stuffed, man.
*  Full-on stuffed.
*  Fucking Burt and Tom called me a couple of weeks ago.
*  Hey, is Hindi a religion?
*  I go, no.
*  No, Hindi's a language, you fucking idiot.
*  Hindu's the religion.
*  Yeah, that's the one I like.
*  That's the one I like?
*  That's the one I like.
*  What the fuck does that even mean?
*  Literally what Burt called to ask me.
*  What does that mean?
*  That's the religion I like.
*  That's the religion he likes.
*  What's your favorite part?
*  What do you like about that one?
*  That's the one with Shiva.
*  Yeah, that's the one I like.
*  Look at this.
*  Like it's a fucking trilogy.
*  Look how packed that place is.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  He sent me that.
*  He goes, fuck.
*  He goes, I don't feel safe.
*  I'm like, yeah.
*  That's in Oklahoma?
*  Yeah, I'm like, yeah, you shouldn't feel safe.
*  I like that there's one guy with the mask on.
*  Yeah, one guy.
*  Meanwhile, the fucking, the cases in Oklahoma
*  are through the roof.
*  Are they really?
*  Yeah, here, I'll put this up on,
*  I'll send this to you, Jamie,
*  so that you can put it online.
*  I don't even have to say who it is.
*  But, you know, there's a lot of people that'll tell ya,
*  you know, they'll tell you that they've got
*  X amount of people in the audience,
*  but then once you actually get there, man,
*  they're fucking.
*  I think once you get to middle America,
*  they're not as ball busting, the authorities?
*  Well, the thing is,
*  I don't think it's the authorities, man.
*  I think it's the people who own the club.
*  They're fucking hurting, man.
*  And they're willing to do anything.
*  I just sent it to you, Jamie.
*  The people that are, I mean, imagine if you've gone,
*  you know, 10 years in the business, there it is.
*  Look at that, folks.
*  There's the guy with the mask.
*  Look how preposterous,
*  that guy looks like an employee, too.
*  That is fucking preposterous, the size of that crowd,
*  that they told him it was only gonna be
*  120 people socially distant.
*  They're stuffed in there.
*  Your account is grossly inaccurate.
*  I bet someone online can count 340 people from that photo.
*  Yeah, that's a lot of fucking people
*  really close to each other.
*  You know, see, the clubs I've been playing,
*  I've noticed they've been paying attention.
*  Like in San Diego, the American Comedy Club,
*  they had no front row at all.
*  Yeah, they're doing it right.
*  Yeah, no front row at all,
*  and then it was after that, it was tables.
*  Yeah, San Diego's doing it right.
*  Now, see, that wouldn't bother me nearly as much.
*  347, that's the count.
*  Jesus Christ, that's a full club.
*  It's a full club.
*  It's very much a full club.
*  That's a packed house.
*  The San Diego's smart.
*  That's a good, see, as long as there's enough space
*  between you and them, so if they're laughing,
*  you're not getting it in your mouth.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  And you're higher than them already, so.
*  That's what you need, and you also probably
*  should have a shield.
*  I spit a lot when I'm on stage.
*  And that's why I would say,
*  there's a reason you're back there and I'm here.
*  We've gotta get to a point where there's a test
*  that you can take immediately.
*  So if they have that saliva test,
*  there's a saliva test.
*  The saliva test makes the most sense to me,
*  because that's where it's transmitted.
*  That's why the blood test seems a little,
*  I mean, I get what you're doing,
*  but saliva seems like the most direct way
*  of you would get it.
*  What's your medical degree?
*  I'm a doctor.
*  I don't know if you know about this.
*  I'm a doctor of the mix, motherfucker.
*  I think that they're gonna have those soon.
*  And apparently, they're really quick,
*  like within a few seconds.
*  They're gonna lick something, and it'll tell you.
*  Because you're more likely to get spit on you
*  from somebody else than blood.
*  But bro, that would be amazing.
*  Everybody wears a mask and line.
*  You get to the door, you lick the thing,
*  it says you're clean, and everybody can come in
*  and be a normal person.
*  If we can get to that, we can open up everything.
*  Restaurants, movie theaters, comedy clubs.
*  Beaches.
*  Yeah, they should put all their effort on that.
*  And I know they're apparently real close to that.
*  Someone was telling, Trump was telling someone
*  that they're real close to doing that.
*  And it's gotta be true.
*  Yeah, it's gotta be.
*  He wouldn't lie.
*  Never.
*  A couple of states today have issued
*  statewide facial covering requirements in public spaces,
*  including Texas and I think Ohio.
*  Well, California's had that for a while, right?
*  We just did that, yeah.
*  Yeah, I have my mask in the car.
*  I wear it as needed.
*  You know, I'm not a, I understand why I'm wearing it.
*  Dude, I was busting Bill Burr's balls about it.
*  Like, you don't wear a mask?
*  CDC says, you don't.
*  I was just trying to rile them up.
*  And they started writing all these articles.
*  Like, I'm seriously like a mask denier or something.
*  A mask denier.
*  They were so silly with what they decided to.
*  You're an anti-mask apologist?
*  Which is one of those things where people
*  are just looking for things to be upset about.
*  Fuckin', I would love to hear Billy's version.
*  Oh, he's the best.
*  He's so upset about everything.
*  Nobody rants better.
*  Well, he's also got rant muscles
*  because he's ranting every week.
*  He does his podcast solo, which is amazing
*  that he can produce that much content.
*  I mean, every fucking week, he's doing two podcasts,
*  the Monday Morning Podcast on Monday,
*  and he does it on Thursday too.
*  So he's doing two long rants every week
*  which is just him.
*  And now he's doing one with Burt.
*  Yes, the Bill and Burt Show.
*  Bill Burt.
*  Bill Burt, yeah.
*  That's a great name.
*  It is perfect.
*  Bill Burt Podcast.
*  And they're so complete fucking polar opposites.
*  Yes.
*  That's what makes it great.
*  Well, Burt's a hustler, man.
*  You gotta give it up to Burt Kreischer.
*  I mean, he's the one who figured out
*  how to do this drive-in movie theater thing.
*  He's got that Two Bears, One Cave he does with Tom.
*  That's doing really well.
*  He's got his own podcast.
*  He's fucking hustlin'.
*  I did Burt's podcast maybe six years ago.
*  He came to my house when I was in Malibu
*  and we did it in my house.
*  We did it up in my bedroom, I believe.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah, we sat on the couch out there.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah, man, you should do your own.
*  I really should.
*  You 100% should do your own.
*  Now's the time.
*  I think on a worldwide scale, mine would do pretty well.
*  Yours is gonna do pretty well here too,
*  but the thing is, you gotta get going
*  because it takes a few months for them
*  to really get cooking and really get a bunch of people
*  into it, but if you think about it now,
*  we're here in June, it's almost July.
*  I don't see us opening any comedy until September or October.
*  I'm scheduled to be in Stand Up Live in Phoenix
*  next weekend.
*  Whoa.
*  But literally day by day I'm getting a text
*  closed, open, closed, open, closed, open.
*  About them?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so Arizona's wild.
*  Arizona is wild.
*  That is the Wild West, son.
*  I mean, they're connected to Mexico.
*  They give zero fucks.
*  They survived Indian attacks.
*  They have an open carry state.
*  First of all, I've never attacked anybody.
*  That's different on Indian.
*  We're the real ones.
*  You are the real ones.
*  Is that offensive that other people call themselves Indians
*  and never even been to India?
*  You mean the Native Americans?
*  Yeah.
*  The Native Americans do not accept the word Indian.
*  They do, that's where you're wrong.
*  I had a Native American lady on this podcast
*  talking to me about Native American tribes
*  and they actually use the term Indian.
*  They like Indian, American Indian.
*  We don't like that.
*  Because they were only called that
*  because he was looking for Indian.
*  Yeah, he fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  What a fuck up too.
*  I know.
*  Jesus.
*  He knew this was in India.
*  You don't think so?
*  Yeah, he fucking knew.
*  He was like, oh, that must be India.
*  He was like, they don't know.
*  That must be Indian, those must be the Indians.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, of course.
*  Christopher Columbus was fucking lost.
*  That's why I was like, what are you doing on Columbus Day?
*  She's getting your car and she's turning your GPS off?
*  Well, didn't they land in the Bahamas?
*  Possibly.
*  I think they landed in the Bahamas.
*  Who, Christopher Columbus?
*  I think the first people that were,
*  Amerigo Vespucci, did he land here?
*  That's where America comes from, right?
*  The name America is Amerigo Vespucci.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm very ignorant to that.
*  Yeah.
*  That thing is in a downer.
*  That's why I like talking to you
*  because you do give me information
*  of should I do that.
*  Very little and I'm often wrong.
*  That's fine.
*  Don't get your information from me.
*  Yeah, but your confidence is within.
*  I'm with, I believe your confidence.
*  I'm confident I'm wrong a lot.
*  Trust me.
*  But yeah, I think they landed,
*  I think they didn't even land in America proper.
*  I think they landed in the Bahamas first,
*  if I remember correctly, which is ridiculous.
*  When, 1600s?
*  I don't know.
*  I mean 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue, right?
*  That's what they say.
*  That's when it happened.
*  We didn't learn that in Canada.
*  So it says actually neither of them landed in America.
*  Where'd they land?
*  I'm trying to remember.
*  America Vespucci.
*  Bahamas for Columbus.
*  Yeah, there we go.
*  You're trying to see where Vespucci landed.
*  See, I know some things.
*  I occasionally know some things.
*  But you know what's crazy is that we still celebrate
*  Columbus Day when we know he's a fucking serial killer.
*  I mean, the guy was a ruthless murderer,
*  a horrific person.
*  The shit that they did to the Native Americans
*  that was documented by the missionaries
*  that came along with them.
*  Yeah, but in outer Mongolia they have Genghis Khan Day,
*  which is really a nice day.
*  That's hilarious.
*  The fireworks are incredible.
*  The rapings, the murders,
*  the skull, lighting people on fire.
*  The skull pyramid.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  Have you ever listened to The Wrath of the Khans
*  from Dan Carlin, from Hardcore History?
*  I didn't know much about Genghis Khan.
*  I knew he was a conqueror and all that stuff.
*  I knew he was ruthless as fuck.
*  Ruthless as fuck.
*  But when you listen to The Wrath of the Khans
*  from Hardcore History,
*  I think you can only get it on Dan Carlin's website now.
*  He keeps a certain, Dan Carlin has a system
*  where he keeps a certain amount of them,
*  it makes them available for free on his iTunes page.
*  But then once they get to a certain number,
*  then he archives them on his website
*  and then you have to pay.
*  But it's only a dollar an episode.
*  And they're amazing.
*  He's got a podcast, but to call his podcast and my podcast
*  the same thing is ridiculous.
*  His podcast is really like an amazing,
*  super entertaining audio history book,
*  whereas this is just you and me talking shit.
*  Yeah, but yours, I think you're underestimating
*  how entertaining yours is.
*  Because I can put it on with no matter
*  who the fuck your guest is.
*  No matter, even if I'm like, I don't know who that is,
*  but I'll watch it, and then I watch it,
*  I go, I just learned so much.
*  Well, that's good.
*  It's good.
*  And sometimes I find even when you have the more,
*  the people that you think are gonna get more from you,
*  like, that wasn't it.
*  Sometimes, yeah, you never know.
*  You never know who's gonna be a good guest.
*  It's good that you got Elon to fucking talk.
*  Because I've met him.
*  Not a talker.
*  Well, he likes me and he knows I like him,
*  and we can talk.
*  He knows that I respect him very much.
*  I respect the shit out of him.
*  And I'm very curious.
*  And so I know how to pull things out of him.
*  And after we did the first one,
*  the first one was a little rough at first, man.
*  If you go back and listen to the first one,
*  the first like, maybe 15, 20 minutes,
*  it's kind of pulling teeth and doing heavy lifting.
*  But then he got comfortable.
*  He was super comfortable when I first met him.
*  When he came to the studio, he was real warm and friendly,
*  gave me the flamethrower.
*  It was good times.
*  That one?
*  Yeah.
*  But then once he settled in, and then we started,
*  we drank, that was one of the reasons
*  why we started drinking right away.
*  I wanted to loosen him up.
*  And then once he got loosened up, then we had a good time.
*  I met him from John Favro,
*  so I figured Fav and him are really good friends.
*  I thought he'd be like, you know,
*  oh cool, you're friends with Fav.
*  It was like, hey, nice to meet you.
*  Dude, he's almost too smart.
*  It's like, he's like talking to dogs.
*  Yeah, I mean, he's got a different level of way
*  of looking at things and making things happen.
*  Yeah, you and I are a couple of collies.
*  Yeah, we're fucking idiots.
*  I mean, me for sure.
*  For sure, both of us.
*  I'm a chihuahua.
*  I'm not even a fucking collie.
*  We're morons.
*  And he's digging tunnels under LA
*  and shooting rockets into space.
*  Meanwhile, he's making electric cars
*  and solar panels and Solar City.
*  Like, what the fuck, man?
*  Yeah, he's the Dr. Dre of science.
*  He's the Nikola Tesla of 2020 is what he is.
*  That's why he named it after him, right?
*  It's important to have guys like that around.
*  It's funny when people talk shit about him.
*  And he's our age.
*  That's the fucking crazy part.
*  Younger than us.
*  Yeah, he's younger than us.
*  He's like 46 or something.
*  I did a Canadian talk show and his mom was on with me.
*  This was earlier this year, I think.
*  Did they have to plug her in?
*  Was she a robot?
*  She's beautiful.
*  Really?
*  She's like 70, but she was a model.
*  And you could see it.
*  You're like, oh yeah, she's...
*  I felt awkward.
*  I'm like, hey, she's fucking hot.
*  Not too awkward, because I was like,
*  I would take a run out if I had the chance.
*  Maybe get the rub, get a little smarter.
*  But yeah, I don't think I was smarter.
*  Imagine if you fuck a smart person,
*  you get a little smarter.
*  That'd be amazing.
*  Yeah, because I think I've definitely gotten dumber.
*  As you got older?
*  No, by fucking dumb women.
*  Oh yeah, you get dumber.
*  Yeah, you make dumb choices.
*  Because you've got to dumb it down
*  to make yourself get in there.
*  You go to their level.
*  And then when you go to a smarter woman's level,
*  you elevate yourself, but then because they're smarter,
*  you can't get away with the same bullshit.
*  There's nothing more embarrassing
*  than if you think a girl is not so smart
*  and then you find out she is smart.
*  That's how you know she's smart,
*  because she played it like she's not smart.
*  You know, Suzanne Summers was like that.
*  She's a very intelligent woman who understood,
*  I'm going to use this to my advantage.
*  That makes sense.
*  As was Farrah Fawcett.
*  Really?
*  She's real smart?
*  She was a very intelligent woman
*  who knew that it was like, okay, I see.
*  I see what you're looking.
*  Cal and told me he did a movie with Megan Fox
*  and he said he made that mistake.
*  He was talking to her like she was a dummy
*  and then she turned on him,
*  rattled off a bunch of facts and information.
*  He realized like, oh.
*  Yeah, there's a reason these people
*  are in the place they're in.
*  Not always.
*  Well, a lot of times.
*  Some of them are hot.
*  True.
*  Very true.
*  Some of them fucked their way.
*  True.
*  That's true too.
*  I remember Whitney got mad at me one night
*  at the Laugh Factory.
*  For what?
*  I don't know, but I was showing another comic like Pics.
*  This was years ago.
*  Pics that girls had sent me.
*  Right.
*  Nudes and shit.
*  And she goes, I want to see.
*  And I go, it's just naked women.
*  She goes, let me see what the girl sent you.
*  And I show her and she got fucking mad.
*  She was like, you know, you gotta stop
*  dating fucking stupid women, Russell.
*  This is disgusting.
*  Go, I didn't want to show you this.
*  She was like, no, you need to do better.
*  You're not an idiot.
*  Why the fuck are you dating idiots?
*  I go, all right.
*  I fucking felt bad after.
*  But you know why she gets like that?
*  Because she's really smart.
*  No, I know.
*  So she probably gets upset at dumb women
*  like setting a bad example.
*  Because I'm sure she gets treated
*  like she's a dumb woman and she's not.
*  So she probably sees dumb women
*  and sees that you give them attention.
*  She's like.
*  She's like, you're hurting us.
*  You're hurting the cause.
*  And I'm like, you know what?
*  And I get it.
*  And you know, the thing with female comics,
*  I don't look at them as female comics,
*  I look at them as comics.
*  Right.
*  Because I'm like, if you're able to do the same job,
*  there's no male or female in my eyes.
*  We are doing the exact same job.
*  The genders are relevant.
*  Well, stand-up comedy's very much a meritocracy.
*  Very much.
*  Yes.
*  The ones who are really good get a lot of respect.
*  No matter what they are.
*  Gay, straight, male, female.
*  Sarah Silverman's one of my favorite comics of all time.
*  Bro, she's a murderer.
*  I see her murder.
*  Fucking incredible.
*  Murder.
*  And that's gender-free.
*  That's male, female, doesn't matter.
*  She's a fucking beast.
*  Yeah, she's a killer.
*  Same with fighters, female fighters.
*  I don't look at them as female fighters.
*  Look at them as fighters.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Because they have the balls to do something
*  I'm not gonna be able to do.
*  Get in there and put it on the line.
*  Do you think you'd do a jujitsu match?
*  I was supposed to do the Worlds this year.
*  Cut the fuck out of here.
*  I was gonna do the Masters.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, in August.
*  Wow.
*  I was so excited for it because I had dropped weight
*  and I was gonna go down to 205
*  because I think the weight limit's 212 with the gi on.
*  And I'm already at 210.
*  I'm like fucking five more pounds, not a big deal.
*  Wow, so Blue Belt Masters.
*  Blue Belt Masters under 50
*  because I'll be 50 in September.
*  Wow.
*  I was so excited about it and then this fucking hole.
*  I was like so pissed.
*  It's not even July.
*  I know.
*  Come on, baby.
*  It's not gonna happen this year.
*  It's not gonna happen?
*  No, they're not happening.
*  It's not happening this year.
*  The Olympics are canceled this year.
*  Is that real?
*  Yeah.
*  Jesus.
*  The Olympics for this year, right?
*  Yeah, they might not even happen.
*  Yeah, they're not happening.
*  The Olympics aren't happening.
*  The Olympics aren't happening
*  even though fucking World Masters Jiu Jitsu's gonna happen.
*  No.
*  Well, there have been some grappling competitions.
*  Right.
*  Submission underground.
*  The EBI's and all that kind of stuff.
*  Well, Chael Sonnen's event, Submission Underground.
*  Was that gi or no gi?
*  I don't, listen, I like no gi,
*  but I'm not ready for no gi.
*  Yeah, I'll come.
*  I don't train enough no gi.
*  I'll train no gi every now and then.
*  And I enjoy it, but it's a much faster game.
*  It's definitely different with grips and stuff.
*  Grips are different.
*  A lot of the neck grabbing that I don't like.
*  You don't like neck grabbing?
*  Well, because I get pimples on my neck.
*  So I'm like, I'm always fucking,
*  get your fucking hand away from me.
*  It's like boxing for me.
*  When I see the hand come, I would push it out of the way
*  so I can get their neck.
*  Well, John Jack always says, don't ever trust your neck.
*  That's what he always tells me.
*  He goes, don't ever trust your neck,
*  unless you have my neck.
*  And then the guy that gave you the iron neck.
*  Yes, you've used those?
*  He came to the gym shortly after I did the podcast
*  last time, and he was dropping off one to John Jack.
*  Oh, beautiful.
*  And he was like, yeah, I just heard you on Rogue.
*  And I go, so can I get one of these fucking things or what?
*  He's like, yeah, you never got it.
*  I definitely need to.
*  I'll give you one.
*  Please, here?
*  I have one here, I have four of them.
*  I have one here and I have three at my house.
*  Because he keeps sending me the newest versions of it,
*  but I still use the old version.
*  Yeah, I just need one.
*  I haven't even set up the, look, the old version's amazing.
*  I'm sure the new version's better,
*  but I haven't even bothered taking it out of the box.
*  I would like to just tighten this shit up here.
*  We'll lose some weight and we'll tighten that shit up.
*  No, it's already, listen, I used to look like a fucking,
*  like a nice sandwich.
*  Looked like an Arby's sandwich here before.
*  Have you used it, the iron neck?
*  No, no.
*  You never used it?
*  I definitely enjoy it.
*  I'm pretty sure I would love to use it.
*  We'll go do it right now.
*  We're done here, I'll take you, I'll show you.
*  It's real easy to use, real simple,
*  and it's the best exercise ever for strength.
*  It's the safest for strengthening your neck.
*  Yeah, we used to, in boxing,
*  we used to have to lay at the end of the ring
*  with your head hanging off.
*  Oh, okay, and then lift weights with the weights.
*  Yeah, just that shit.
*  And it wasn't even like a thing that was secure.
*  It was like a fucking leather strap belt
*  with some weights hanging off your forehead.
*  You had to be careful it didn't slip off.
*  I have one of those too, but I don't like it.
*  No, I didn't like it either.
*  I don't think it's natural to put extra weight on your head
*  and then bend it and put all that pressure
*  on your discs of your neck.
*  The beautiful thing about the iron neck
*  is it strengthens your neck
*  without having to bend it in any weird way.
*  You keep your neck totally straight.
*  So your posture is straight like this,
*  and you have the halo that goes on the head,
*  and then the 50 pound bungee cord.
*  So as you back up, you're never doing weird shit like this,
*  which puts that additional pressure on your discs.
*  It's easy, buddy.
*  I'm looking forward to this.
*  All right, we'll do it.
*  Anything else?
*  Let's wrap this up.
*  Whatever you want.
*  Anything to talk about?
*  No, I'm good, whatever you like.
*  Let everybody know.
*  The Russell Peters show will be premiering.
*  Let me read you what I want to tell you.
*  Did you write some shit down?
*  For real?
*  Wrote some shit down.
*  Did you?
*  It's a nice watch, by the way.
*  Thank you.
*  You want it?
*  It's very sporty.
*  I gave you a watch once before.
*  You did.
*  You gave me a Breitling.
*  And I wear it every time I do a special.
*  Do you?
*  Yep.
*  It's my good luck watch.
*  Oh, I appreciate that.
*  If you look at Triggered and Strange Times,
*  I'm wearing your watch.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  You know, whenever I'm watching UFC, I go,
*  what's he wearing?
*  And I noticed you're always wearing
*  like this stainless roly.
*  I'm like, fuck, that's not my watch.
*  I wear your watch all the time.
*  I know.
*  It makes me happy.
*  It makes me happy, too.
*  I still have the watch you gave me for that.
*  I just had a watch on.
*  You had a watch on.
*  You gave it to me.
*  You had a leather strap, you said it smelled.
*  It fucking stinks.
*  Holy shit.
*  It fucking stunk.
*  It's an old ass watch.
*  But when you gave me that watch, legitimately,
*  I think my Comedy Central special from 2014
*  has that watch on, too.
*  That's my good luck watch.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  I wear it for every special.
*  That makes me really happy.
*  Makes me happy, too, bro.
*  Let's see, what do I want?
*  Different psychedelics, blah, blah, blah.
*  I said to my guy, I said, hey, Todd,
*  I'm doing Rogan today.
*  I wanna talk about our company.
*  And he goes, oh, that's the one I'm working with,
*  the one I'm CCO of.
*  Oh, the one.
*  I'm like, oh, great, Holland.
*  And I'm like, oh, great.
*  And then I go, send me some talking points.
*  This fucking guy sends me,
*  I'm like, these aren't points.
*  This is a paragraph.
*  I don't know.
*  I need something I can look at
*  and get the information real quick.
*  That's more than a paragraph.
*  That's many paragraphs.
*  It keeps going.
*  Yeah, that's a lecture.
*  He sent you a TED Talk.
*  Fucking Todd Shapiro.
*  Anyway, redlighttruffles.com.
*  That's what I want.
*  I can't imagine how the truffles are legal
*  and then the caps are not.
*  Maybe it's a Holland thing.
*  Because it's the root.
*  It's still psilocybin.
*  Right, but for some reason,
*  it's the loophole and we're taking advantage of the loophole.
*  Okay, I'm all in.
*  And we're doing it in a way that it doesn't fuck you up.
*  How's that?
*  We're taking the right amounts for the microdosing.
*  Small amounts, yeah.
*  Small for the microdosing.
*  It's microdosing only at this point.
*  Well, a lot of people in San Francisco,
*  before San Francisco imploded,
*  they were all doing the microdosing
*  in tech communities, they were doing it.
*  It was really big in tech.
*  That'd be great, yeah,
*  because you open up your mind, you get some ideas.
*  Yeah.
*  What does Elon do then?
*  Because he's got some fucking wild out there ideas.
*  Bro, Elon's on another level.
*  He's the next stage of evolution.
*  That's what I think.
*  I think we're all like chimp people
*  and he's like this new thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he named his kid then.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  I saw a meme that said,
*  Elon Musk's kid will not have birthdays,
*  it'll have updates.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  He's too fucking smart.
*  I don't want to be that smart.
*  That's one of the things that I asked him too.
*  I was like, what is it like?
*  He's like, you wouldn't want to be me.
*  He literally said that.
*  I can't imagine him getting sleep.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think ideas are just bouncing off his head
*  like a fucking Superball.
*  The inside of his head just.
*  Yeah, it's like pong.
*  Yeah.
*  But when you get it stuck between things.
*  Yeah.
*  Bro, better off being dumb like us, right?
*  I mean, you're to me, you are,
*  I don't know if you know this,
*  but to me and a lot of people,
*  I would say almost all of your listeners,
*  you were the guy that a lot of people go to
*  to find out information.
*  Yeah, because I have a good memory, but that's it.
*  You have a good memory and you're non-biased.
*  I try, try very hard.
*  Yeah.
*  That's one thing that I've learned from doing this podcast.
*  I've learned how to look at information
*  for what it really is.
*  And I'm learning there's zero benefit
*  in not admitting you're wrong
*  and zero benefit in pretending you have information
*  that you don't have.
*  Like if I don't know something, I ask.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  You know, it's very important.
*  Yeah, you're very good at retaining things.
*  Some things, ask my wife, a lot of shit I don't.
*  I mean, you didn't remember to download
*  Scotty Fox's mix that I sent you, but I mean.
*  When you told me I was probably high.
*  We were at dinner, it was you, me, the hunter guy,
*  and the black guy who makes me feel bad
*  about sleeping in.
*  Oh, Goggins.
*  That's hilarious.
*  So was it Cam Haines and Goggins?
*  Yeah, we were. That's right.
*  We were in Vegas. Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  It was the four of us.
*  That's right, that's right.
*  And I looked at.
*  Chuck Zito had that crazy jacket.
*  Yeah. With the tassels,
*  the crazy Native American jacket.
*  So he comes over to hug everybody
*  and his tassels are getting in everybody's drinks.
*  He's got gravy on him and stuff.
*  Chuck Zito's such a character.
*  I love Chuck.
*  He's, you know, despite his hard exterior,
*  he's the sweetest guy in the world.
*  Sweet guy.
*  I could count on him at any time of the day.
*  Yeah, he's quite a character too.
*  67 years old.
*  That's amazing.
*  He looks great.
*  He looks great and he's.
*  He had a healthcare a while back, right?
*  Yeah, a few, four, five years ago.
*  Prostate cancer, got it removed.
*  Bounced back.
*  Bounced back.
*  Beautiful.
*  The old school, you know, the old school guys are like,
*  you know, it's about honor and their word.
*  And I appreciate that.
*  I think I'm a little old school in that regard.
*  Yeah, I think you are too.
*  I would say that.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  What about my word?
*  Eh.
*  Fuck it.
*  Fuck it.
*  Russell Peters show coming soon.
*  When can people plan on it?
*  September?
*  Oh, you tell me.
*  I'm gonna need you. September.
*  September, let's do it.
*  Yeah, we're working out through this month in August.
*  Joe's gonna guide me through this.
*  We'll start doing some dry runs.
*  I'll be guest number one.
*  How about that?
*  That'd be fucking amazing.
*  Yes!
*  We'll get you high on mushrooms.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  You know, we'll get high on mushrooms
*  and do the first one.
*  That sounds good.
*  That's amazing.
*  Let's do it.
*  Russell Peters, ladies and gentlemen,
*  goodbye America and the rest of the world.
*  Look out for the value
