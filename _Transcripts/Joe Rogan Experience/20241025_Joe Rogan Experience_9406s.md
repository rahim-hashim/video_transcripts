*  And we're up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=10.16s)]
*  Exciting times, exciting times. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=12.16s)]
*  It's a good time to be a conspiracy theorist. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=16.04s)]
*  It's a good time to be a conspiracy theorist. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  It's a great time to be a comedian. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=19.04s)]
*  These are the good days, the all or nothing days. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=21.64s)]
*  Yeah, these are the good days until the election and then who the fuck knows what happens. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Just fast forward to it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=28.28s)]
*  Did you see this thing that the Biden administration pushed through? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=29.52s)]
*  This new martial law thing? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=34.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=36.64s)]
*  This is very disturbing. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=37.64s)]
*  Jamie, please Google this so we can find out what the actual law states, but it's DOD [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=39.0s)]
*  Directive 5240.01 giving the Pentagon power for the first time in history to use lethal [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=45.84s)]
*  force to kill Americans on US soil who protest government policies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=52.96s)]
*  What are they expecting? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=58.92s)]
*  525.01 sounds right? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=60.92s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=64.48s)]
*  Did I tell you what it is? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=65.48s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=67.48s)]
*  524.01. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=68.48s)]
*  DOD Directive. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=69.48s)]
*  This is from RFK Jr. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=72.48s)]
*  Posted this on Twitter and I'm finding out about it because people are blowing me up [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=74.48s)]
*  about it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=79.12s)]
*  That's fucking terrifying. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=81.04s)]
*  That is a terrifying thing to push through for the first time in US history giving the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=83.08s)]
*  military the ability to shoot and kill American citizens. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=87.92s)]
*  That's crazy too. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=92.36s)]
*  It's interesting because you know with the Smith-Munts Modernization Act and stuff like [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=94.12s)]
*  that, it's almost like they kind of in a weird way just make it legal what they're already [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=99.44s)]
*  doing. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=104.84s)]
*  What is that, the Smith Modernization Act? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=105.84s)]
*  The Smith-Munts Modernization Act that Obama pushed through which basically made it so [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=107.72s)]
*  it was legal for the US government to use propaganda against its citizens, which they [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=111.84s)]
*  were already doing in different ways through CIA and all that stuff. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=117.36s)]
*  So it sounds like we can legally do it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=120.88s)]
*  You can't sue us now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  How crazy is it that it's legal to lie? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=123.64s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=126.32s)]
*  It's legal for the government to not just legally lie but they can concoct completely [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=127.32s)]
*  fabricated stories just to push a narrative if they decide that it's in the best interest [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=131.7s)]
*  of national security or whatever. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  To just manipulate energy in your mind and all that stuff to get you to believe certain [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=139.32s)]
*  things. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=143.64s)]
*  We need to bring back shame, that's my opinion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=145.32s)]
*  Well they have none. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=148.28s)]
*  It's not going to work. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=149.28s)]
*  It can't bring back shame to lizard people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=150.28s)]
*  Yeah, they can't feel anything. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  It's in their reptilian brains which is very, some weird shit going on right now with that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=154.12s)]
*  It's weird because like you know that David Icke stuff where he said they're all lizard [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=159.6s)]
*  people? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=162.64s)]
*  I don't think they're really lizard people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=163.64s)]
*  I don't think they're really shape shifters but they do behave in a reptilian way like [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=164.64s)]
*  a corporation does, like a psychopath. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=170.14s)]
*  I don't know if they're actual reptilians dude but there is something going on that [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=173.32s)]
*  they are a group of people because they're all related which is very weird if you go [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=177.84s)]
*  back far enough they're all related. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=183.28s)]
*  If you study Obama and Bush right, because I remember when Obama was running I was like [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=185.28s)]
*  oh change, it's going to be change. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=190.6s)]
*  Hope and change. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=192.32s)]
*  Hope and change and then you start studying the Bush's and the Obama's and their first [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=193.32s)]
*  ancestor, their common ancestor is a Hinckley dude. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=199.4s)]
*  Like John Hinckley? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=203.48s)]
*  The guy who tried to kill Reagan? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=204.48s)]
*  100%! [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  Yes, their common ancestor is a Hinckley and then when you realize that Hinckley was related [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  to Obama and Bush and related to the Bush's had dinner with the Hinckleys the night before [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  Reagan got shot and here's the craziest thing. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=219.92s)]
*  What? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=224.0s)]
*  Is that crazy? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=225.0s)]
*  I always thought Hinckley was a lone nut that was infatuated with Jody Foster. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=226.08s)]
*  What? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=231.44s)]
*  No dude and he actually, there's actually interviews dude where he said, Uncle George [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=232.44s)]
*  told me to do it. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=239.52s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=240.52s)]
*  Didn't they just let him out? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=241.52s)]
*  Yeah and now he's doing like plain and coffee beans because he's put out an album or something [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=243.24s)]

*  He's torn off it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=250.12s)]
*  But that's a crazy thing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=252.16s)]
*  Barack Obama, the 10th cousin once removed of George W. Bush through Samuel Hinckley [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=253.8s)]
*  of Cape Cod. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=258.68s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=261.72s)]
*  I've never gone down the Hinckley rabbit hole. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=262.72s)]
*  So John Hinckley, the guy who killed or shot rather Reagan, what was his deal? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=265.64s)]
*  Was he MKUltra? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he was a little off. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  He was like the one family member that was a little off. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=274.32s)]
*  Here's the craziest thing about that thing. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=277.64s)]
*  But Hinckley that shoots at Reagan, he's the first one that can use the, I'm mentally [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=280.28s)]
*  not capable of defending myself. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=284.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm too mentally ill. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=287.59999999999997s)]

*  He's like, no way. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=737.18s)]
*  I was like, yeah, read it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=738.18s)]
*  He's like, what the fuck? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=739.18s)]
*  I go, yeah, read it. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=740.18s)]
*  It's so crazy because he's super highly educated. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=741.5799999999999s)]
*  And Brian Callan is a sweetheart. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=745.18s)]
*  People don't realize that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=746.86s)]
*  He's almost to a point like he's a people pleaser where he just wants to make sure everybody's [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=748.14s)]
*  happy. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=751.9s)]
*  A little bit of that. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=752.9s)]
*  A little bit. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=753.9s)]
*  And he kind of puts himself in some weird situations once in a while. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=754.9s)]
*  But at the end of the day, he has a good heart and he means really well. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=756.42s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=760.0999999999999s)]
*  I've been friends with Brian for 30 years. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=761.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's the best. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=762.62s)]
*  We're real good friends. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=763.62s)]
*  I love him to death. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=764.62s)]
*  And he wants to have hope. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=765.62s)]
*  He wants to believe that the government is good. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=768.2199999999999s)]
*  And I think the government is mostly good. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=770.54s)]
*  That's what I think about people. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=772.66s)]
*  I think people are mostly good. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=774.38s)]
*  I think most people are great. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=776.42s)]
*  But I think the reason the Second Amendment exists is some people are not great. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=778.8199999999999s)]
*  Some people are really bad and you want to protect the great people from the people that [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=782.62s)]
*  are really bad. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  And that's a reality, unfortunate reality. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=786.98s)]
*  I would like that to go away. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=788.9399999999999s)]
*  I would like there'd be no need for guns because everyone's amazing. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=790.54s)]
*  That would be the best. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=794.0999999999999s)]
*  But pretending that everyone's the best without fixing all the problems that make people fucked [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=796.82s)]
*  up in the first place while trying to remove guns so only outlaws have guns is the dumbest [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=801.82s)]
*  fucking strategy. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=807.74s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=808.74s)]
*  And every city that pulls that off, like Chicago or Detroit or any of these places that try [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=809.74s)]
*  that shit, it's a disaster in a fucking war zone. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=813.54s)]
*  You know? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=817.34s)]
*  I mean, there's more people get murdered in Chicago every weekend than probably any city [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=818.34s)]
*  in the country. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=821.9s)]
*  The places with the strictest gun laws have the most violence. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=822.9s)]
*  It's fucking dumb. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=826.5s)]
*  It doesn't work that way. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=827.5s)]
*  You have to look at things realistically. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=828.5s)]
*  And then you have to look at the root of the problem instead of looking at the actions. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=831.6600000000001s)]
*  Don't look at the actions. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=835.5s)]
*  Look at what causes the actions. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=836.5s)]
*  Extreme poverty, despair, gang-ridden, crime-ridden neighborhoods. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=838.26s)]
*  If you don't fix them, you're going to keep getting the same kind of people that come [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=843.02s)]
*  out of there. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=846.0600000000001s)]

*  We spent $175 billion on Ukraine. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=849.02s)]
*  That's so crazy, dude. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=852.7s)]
*  We could have easily fixed all of our inner-city problems. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=853.94s)]
*  We could have set up community centers, given people nutritious food. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=857.6600000000001s)]
*  We could have completely renovated the schools, fixed the schools, brought in athletes and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=862.6400000000001s)]
*  musicians and people to do seminars and show people how they can get out of things, teach [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=868.7800000000001s)]

*  You can get jobs. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=879.22s)]

*  We could have done that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=887.54s)]
*  Scarcity, dude. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=889.54s)]

*  Yeah, I don't think it is. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=892.54s)]

*  I think it's the exact same thing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=912.7s)]
*  The reason why they're letting in so many people and giving them money and putting them [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=914.26s)]

*  Go South Central. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=948.0200000000001s)]

*  energy stuff, man. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=958.48s)]

*  they run the same playbook over and over again, which is take, take, like if you study the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=966.06s)]
*  natives, right, they took, they killed all the buffalo, which took away all the jobs [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=970.78s)]
*  from the guys. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=975.66s)]
*  That's a little more complicated. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=976.66s)]
*  The Native American story is a little more complicated in that regard because the buffalo [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=978.14s)]
*  thing, there's some evidence that some people were killing the buffalo to deprive the Native [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=982.62s)]
*  Most of it was just wanton and destructive recklessness and just like greed, just horrible [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=990.08s)]
*  greed. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=997.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=998.88s)]
*  You know what they were doing it for? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=999.88s)]
*  Pickled tongues. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1000.88s)]
*  That was the primary thing they were getting. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1002.12s)]
*  Before they were even getting skins from the buffalo, they were getting tongues. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1004.44s)]
*  Tongues was like one of the big things because you could take them, you could pickle them, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  you could send them back east and they were worth a lot of money. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1011.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1014.12s)]
*  Because the buffalo tongue is like that big. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1015.12s)]
*  So they're shooting this 1800 pound animal for a fucking 10 pound tongue. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1016.28s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1021.48s)]
*  And then, you know, the guys didn't have, the males, the men didn't have jobs. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1022.48s)]
*  And the women always had jobs because they had children and that was their job. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1027.52s)]
*  And then you look at the black community, they did that exact same thing with the crack [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1030.36s)]
*  epidemic. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1033.72s)]
*  They took away all the jobs. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1034.72s)]
*  They flooded it with drugs. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1035.72s)]
*  They locked up all the men, destroyed the community. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1037.24s)]
*  And now you see that kind of happening in the bigger cities now where it's like, I was [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1039.84s)]
*  flying on this one airline, I forget what it is, and they were like, we're training [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1043.6599999999999s)]
*  only women now to be pilots. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1047.02s)]

*  How about train the best humans? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1051.82s)]

*  If they're not women, don't hire them. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1055.34s)]

*  But you know what that is. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1062.26s)]
*  That's all that DEI stuff where they have to like in order to get funding, you know, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1063.4199999999998s)]
*  in order to like there's there's a financial incentive to meet DEI quotas. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1068.18s)]
*  A lot of companies are abandoning them now. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1073.9s)]

*  It just starts at 2011 and just spikes thousands and thousands. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1092.28s)]
*  The articles, the mentions in the newspapers. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1098.22s)]
*  Mentions on social media all of a sudden became a big thing. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1101.66s)]
*  And then you have all your race hustlers who are taking advantage of these DEI quotas and [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1104.78s)]
*  they provide seminars for exorbitant rates. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1109.1000000000001s)]

*  I think but that one seems to be, I don't think they realized the impact it was going [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1142.66s)]
*  to have. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1146.5800000000002s)]
*  I think they were just trying to push a narrative that people are racist and like we should [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  not be racist. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1150.46s)]
*  And it was like a good talking point for the Obama administration. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1151.46s)]
*  But then it spread to transphobia and homophobic. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1155.26s)]
*  It just went wild. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1159.7s)]
*  Yeah, they're just looking for stuff. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1160.7s)]
*  I think it's there's a bigger play and it's divide and conquer. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1163.1s)]
*  And these are these are playbooks that plays in the playbook that they run to do this. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1167.3799999999999s)]
*  And you know, it's like for me, it's like study the Cultural Revolution of China study [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1172.46s)]
*  the Bolshevik Revolution of Russia. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1177.1s)]
*  And I'm sorry, but people think I'm crazy. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1180.98s)]
*  But what the Nazis did to Germany, it's like these are these are playbooks to destroy these [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1183.18s)]
*  these giant, powerful countries that you can't just invade you because you'll get your dick [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1189.14s)]
*  kicked in. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1193.5s)]
*  So you have to kind of destroy from inside. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1194.5s)]
*  And I think everything you're talking about right now is of a playbook of cultural Marxism [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1196.46s)]
*  that this is how you destroy from the inside and like that Yuri Bevin off or whatever his [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1201.54s)]

*  And the argument is there's a thing called the Younger Drys Impact Theory that happened [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1422.08s)]
*  around 11,000 years ago, documented, proven, 100 percent real event. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1426.1999999999998s)]
*  They know the dates that it happens because it happens every year. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1431.36s)]
*  Was it November and June? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1435.9599999999998s)]
*  Is that when the meteor the Leonid meteor shower is what it is? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1437.32s)]
*  So there's a comet shower that we pass through twice a year. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1441.12s)]
*  And every now and then a big chunk like the Tunguska event, the Tunguska event in the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1445.3s)]
*  early 1900s, which flattened like a million acres in Siberia, is the exact same time period [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1450.32s)]
*  where we pass through this shower. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1457.12s)]
*  So they believe that at 11,800 years ago, this impact and this is proven by core samples [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1459.2399999999998s)]
*  that show high levels of your iridium, high levels of this nuclear glass that happens [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1467.1599999999999s)]
*  on impacts. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1472.32s)]
*  And they find this stuff all in the same area around 11,800 BC. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1473.84s)]
*  And then another one that's somewhere around 10,000 11,800 years ago, rather, and another [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1478.6399999999999s)]
*  one that's like 10,000 plus years ago. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1484.04s)]
*  So they think there's like multiple events that took place over a few thousand years, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1485.8799999999999s)]
*  which totally makes sense if we pass through this fucking shower all the time and it nuked [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1490.6799999999998s)]
*  a giant chunk of Siberia in the early 1900s. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1494.76s)]
*  So all he's saying, all Graham Hancock is saying is we are a species with amnesia. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1498.64s)]
*  And to call him a racist, the whole thing's nuts. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1504.68s)]
*  I love it, dude. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1508.72s)]
*  And like, I think the world before that event was crazy, bro. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1510.26s)]
*  It was like, I think it's like Game of Thrones meets like Harry Potter. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1515.2s)]
*  Like it was the craziest thing ever. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1520.6s)]
*  Even if you study like the stuff that happened in the Bible and all these crazy things they [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1524.0400000000002s)]
*  say people did, I think all that stuff was possible before that. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1527.76s)]
*  And it just wiped out this incredible civilization that was so advanced. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1531.2800000000002s)]
*  And they could manipulate energy and they could do all this. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1536.24s)]
*  Who built the pyramids? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1539.48s)]
*  Maybe Nephilim. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1540.7800000000002s)]
*  Who? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1541.7800000000002s)]
*  No, dude. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1542.7800000000002s)]
*  Giants just lifting logs and putting, I mean, giant bricks and putting them in there. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1543.7800000000002s)]
*  Whoever did it, they had an insane level of sophistication. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1546.72s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense when you compare the rest of the world. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1550.52s)]
*  The rest of the world at 2500 BC, which is the conventional date. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1553.88s)]
*  Let's say that's correct. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1558.6000000000001s)]
*  Just the conventional date. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1559.8400000000001s)]
*  Graham Hancock thinks it was probably much earlier. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1560.92s)]
*  But let's say the conventional date. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1563.3400000000001s)]
*  No one else was doing anything like that. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1565.0800000000002s)]
*  2500 BC. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1567.0s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1568.24s)]
*  So what was going on there? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1569.24s)]
*  Did they just have insane resources? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1570.76s)]
*  Did they have so much food and water and they existed for thousands of years? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1573.24s)]
*  Just like, you know, look, we were talking about this. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  I had Brian Cox on yesterday and we were talking about how if you go back literally [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1578.4s)]
*  120 years ago, you have Wilbur and Orville Wright flying this bullshit ass plane. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1583.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1588.4s)]
*  Now 120 years later, you have Elon Musk and Starship X catching rockets on a fucking machine. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1589.4s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1594.68s)]
*  Ah! [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1595.68s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1596.68s)]
*  The kind of progress that you're looking at is fucking impossible to imagine. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1597.68s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1602.2800000000002s)]
*  Imagine if these Egyptians had this same sort of situation where they had an established [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1603.44s)]
*  civilization, an established culture, plenty of food, plenty of resources, brilliant people, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1609.16s)]
*  no war. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1614.76s)]
*  And then they just start figuring stuff out but on a different pathway. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1615.76s)]
*  Instead of with like engines and internal combustion and electronics, they go a different [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1620.12s)]
*  way. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1626.44s)]
*  And we don't know what that way is. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1627.44s)]
*  But it's totally possible that that way exists. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1628.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1631.4s)]
*  There's a lot of great YouTube channels that break this stuff down like on my lunch break [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1632.4s)]
*  and Analog. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1636.36s)]
*  I've had him on my show and he was telling me this story about how like they were drilling [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1638.4s)]
*  low and then they got to this and there was this giant like cavern and they found like [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1643.08s)]
*  a whole civilization down there that was empty. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1647.48s)]
*  And he talked about one time where they just kept drilling and they just would find civilization [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1650.92s)]
*  on top of civilization and they got low enough that they found like, like in America, they [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1655.04s)]
*  found like Chinese writing low enough. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1659.68s)]
*  Where is this? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1662.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1663.0800000000002s)]
*  If you study these guys, they have these YouTube channels. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  It's on my lunch break and Analog and they just, they just break down kind of like something [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1667.0s)]
*  I talked about last time I was on here, which was Tartaria, but it's lost civilizations, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1672.0800000000002s)]
*  how our timeline is completely fucked. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1677.16s)]
*  It's not even, it's not even real. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1679.8s)]
*  There's people think like we're millions of years old and we have these giant events that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1681.5s)]
*  kind of come and reset us. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1685.8s)]
*  But they dig deep enough. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1687.64s)]
*  There's like civilizations keep digging. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1689.48s)]
*  There's another civilization over and over and over. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1691.56s)]
*  And we're just, we're just on top of giants, dude. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1694.2s)]
*  Well, that's the case with Egypt. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1697.04s)]
*  There's old kingdom and then there's new kingdom stuff. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1698.4s)]
*  And when you go deeper into the sand, you find more complex building, which is nuts, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1700.92s)]
*  bigger stones, like crazy stuff, man. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1706.0s)]
*  That old kingdom Egypt stuff is a specific style. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1708.4s)]
*  And so, you know, maybe that was 11,800 years ago and then maybe 10,000 years ago is the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1711.96s)]
*  other one. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1716.6s)]
*  Like we don't know. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1717.6s)]
*  We don't know how old that stuff is. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1719.2s)]
*  Well, it's almost like the Egyptians were just kind of moved in and they're like, these [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1720.6000000000001s)]
*  are our pyramids and like Egyptians of Cleopatra's age. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1725.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1728.72s)]
*  But someone, you know, long as time ago had knowledge of the constellations, had an understanding [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1730.0s)]
*  of how to point something to perfect due north, south, east and west. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1736.14s)]
*  And just the the calculations that have to be involved in getting 2,300,000 stones to [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1740.08s)]
*  come to a perfect point. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1745.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1747.56s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1748.56s)]
*  And then some of them, they're moving these stones from 500 miles through the mountains [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1749.8799999999999s)]
*  and then they have stones that are like 80 tons and they're lifting them 300 feet onto [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1755.0s)]
*  the ceiling. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1759.52s)]

*  Look at that. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1850.04s)]
*  And then the one to the left of that, too. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1851.04s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1852.04s)]
*  Fuck, dude. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1853.04s)]
*  And when you walk around there, you I mean, photos barely do it justice. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1854.04s)]
*  So you go the one there in the lower right hand side, Jamie, with all the people in it [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1857.9599999999998s)]

*  You see all these people roaming around in it. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1868.8799999999999s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1871.56s)]
*  And so people were just really good at carpentry and craftsmanship back then. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1873.32s)]
*  And it was a skill that was taught in school. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1877.96s)]
*  You know, like how many sculptors are there today? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1882.24s)]
*  It's probably a dying thing. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1884.44s)]
*  It's probably very few actual sculptors. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1885.44s)]
*  But back then it was a real craft that you can get into. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1887.96s)]
*  Especially, you know, you're doing all this stuff by hand. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1891.72s)]
*  Like they didn't even have power tools. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1894.52s)]
*  OK, so that whole thing was built without table saws, no band saws. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1897.48s)]
*  It was all planers and hand chisels. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1903.28s)]
*  Something. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1906.0s)]
*  Hand saws. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1907.0s)]
*  Something, dude. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1908.0s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1909.0s)]
*  I mean, like, we don't know the technology. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1910.0s)]
*  We know the dates of that. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1912.68s)]
*  We know the people that did it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1913.92s)]
*  That's all doable. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1915.28s)]
*  It's especially doable over hundreds and hundreds of years of working on it, which is what we [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1916.6000000000001s)]
*  know that they did. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1920.44s)]
*  When you get to things like the pyramid, all definitions kind of fall apart because there's [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1922.04s)]
*  too many stones. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  I think they said that they gave a timeline of something in the neighborhood of 20 years, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1929.0s)]
*  the Pharaoh Khufu, his lifetime, and that in order to build that pyramid just within [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1934.88s)]
*  his lifetime, within his reign, which was like 20 years, you would have to place a stone [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1941.04s)]
*  every 30 seconds or something crazy like that. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1946.2s)]
*  You have to cut, place, measure, and it would take 30 seconds per stone. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1948.28s)]
*  And you have to run the clock. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1952.6799999999998s)]
*  How the fuck? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1954.52s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1958.32s)]
*  Like, they're building that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1959.32s)]
*  And now I drive through this country doing standup and you see like churches are in like [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1960.32s)]
*  strip malls now, right? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1965.32s)]
*  It's like you got church right next to a Jamba Juice. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=1966.6399999999999s)]

*  Oh, so he was old. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2143.82s)]
*  It was old Johnny Cash. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2145.18s)]
*  1990. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2146.78s)]
*  OK, not too old. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2147.78s)]
*  Not too old. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2149.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2150.62s)]
*  That's fucking great. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2151.62s)]
*  And you just listen to him. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2152.62s)]
*  And like I never sat down and read the Bible. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2154.9s)]
*  I've never actually read what's in it. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2157.38s)]
*  I've been always told what was in it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2159.2599999999998s)]
*  I never read it. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2160.9s)]
*  And now to hear it actually read, which technically I'm not reading it either. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2161.9s)]
*  I'm listening. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2165.66s)]
*  But you know, it's like it's really interesting. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2166.66s)]
*  I try to say I read a book to Don L. Rawlings. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2169.9s)]
*  I told him I read it on, I listened to it on an audio tape. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2172.18s)]
*  He goes, no, you didn't read it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2175.42s)]
*  I was like, I absorbed the information. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2177.1s)]
*  But you did not read it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2179.14s)]
*  That's fine, Kallen too. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2180.14s)]
*  You're right. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2181.14s)]
*  I read this book. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2182.14s)]
*  You listen to a tape, which is fine. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2183.14s)]
*  I haven't read a book in a long time. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2184.9s)]
*  Well, because you're busy, dude. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2186.42s)]
*  I read articles. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2187.94s)]
*  I read science papers, but I don't read very many books. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2188.94s)]
*  Most books I get in the sauna or I get on the way over to here. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2192.5s)]
*  Yeah, I love it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2197.66s)]
*  Because I can retain knowledge better listening than I can actually reading it because I just [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2198.66s)]
*  go, what did I just read? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2203.3799999999997s)]
*  And I have to go back and I'm the worst reader possible. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2204.3799999999997s)]
*  You have to learn how to absorb information. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2207.58s)]
*  So it's like everything else. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2209.58s)]
*  Like if you're talking to someone but you're drifting, you're not really thinking about [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2210.7799999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2214.22s)]
*  You're like, oh, I got to do laundry. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2215.22s)]
*  You start thinking stuff. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2216.22s)]
*  Then you're not paying attention. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2217.22s)]
*  And then you've got to catch up to what they're saying. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2218.22s)]
*  You're just looking for clues. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2219.22s)]
*  Especially if you're talking to someone who's just talking at you. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2220.22s)]
*  People that talk at you are so brutal because they're not really there with you. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2224.54s)]
*  They just have a thing and they're pressing play. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2229.9s)]
*  You just happen to be there. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2232.38s)]
*  You happen to be there. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2233.38s)]
*  And they're just drive-by shooting you. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2234.42s)]
*  And they just want you to smile and make them look good. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2236.06s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2238.42s)]
*  They don't really give a fuck what your opinions are. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2239.42s)]
*  But if you're talking to one of those people, it's super easy to drift. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2241.42s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2243.82s)]
*  You just start thinking about shit you've got to do. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2244.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, I should probably do that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2246.82s)]
*  Oh, I forgot to call that guy. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2247.82s)]
*  Well, I'm a crazy person so my brain is thinking about a thousand things at one time. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2248.82s)]
*  Welcome to the club. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2253.94s)]
*  We're both comedians. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2254.94s)]
*  I'm like an iPhone. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2255.94s)]
*  I'm multitasking, doing a bunch of stuff. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2257.94s)]
*  We were trying to have a conversation about this in the green room the other day. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2260.1800000000003s)]
*  All the different people, they're all, I go, listen. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2263.1400000000003s)]
*  Anybody doing this job is out of their fucking mind. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2265.62s)]
*  Crazy, dude. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2267.62s)]
*  Which is fine. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2268.62s)]
*  It's okay to be out of your mind. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2269.62s)]
*  My favorite people are out of their fucking mind. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2270.62s)]
*  Just be a good person. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2272.54s)]
*  Be out of your mind, but be nice. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2273.7s)]
*  Be out of your mind, but be nice. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2275.3799999999997s)]
*  Be generous. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2276.7s)]
*  Be charitable. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2277.7s)]
*  It's okay to be out of your mind. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2278.7s)]
*  But you should also probably figure out a way to manage your mind. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2279.7s)]
*  My way to manage my mind is cold plunges, workouts, saunas, brutalize myself, meditate. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2283.98s)]
*  That way, when I do such difficult shit on my own, that the difficulties of regular [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2291.18s)]
*  life are pretty passive. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2297.18s)]
*  They're not that big of a deal. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2298.54s)]
*  It's not like three minutes in 33 degree water. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2300.06s)]
*  You go through it to get to it. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2302.98s)]
*  It's not like a kettlebell workout where you fucking think you're going to throw up. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2303.98s)]
*  It's okay. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2308.3799999999997s)]
*  Jiu-jitsu class, you're getting strangled. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2309.3799999999997s)]
*  If you get through all that stuff, regular life is easier. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2311.1s)]
*  That's why being on the couch is bad. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2315.1s)]
*  Being on the couch is bad, not because it's not great to be on the couch. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2317.4199999999996s)]
*  I love to be on the couch. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2320.42s)]
*  I love watching me a little Netflix, sitting down for a little show gun binge watching. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2321.6600000000003s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2326.5s)]
*  But it's too comfortable. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2328.02s)]
*  When that becomes your baseline, then anything that's uncomfortable becomes difficult to [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2331.46s)]
*  handle because most of your day is relaxation and sedentary lifestyle. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2336.26s)]
*  That's not good for you. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2343.98s)]
*  It's not good for your brain. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2344.98s)]
*  Forget about your body. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2346.5s)]
*  Forget about vanity. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2348.1800000000003s)]
*  It's not good for the brain. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2349.82s)]
*  The brain needs ... You need voluntary adversity so that life's adversity becomes normal. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2351.26s)]
*  I'm sure you know military guys. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2360.7000000000003s)]
*  I have a lot of friends that have been in war. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2362.46s)]
*  Those guys that have been in war have a completely different reaction to regular bullshit. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2366.78s)]
*  Regular bullshit is not that big a deal to those guys. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2372.94s)]
*  They're just like, this is just regular bullshit. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2375.7400000000002s)]
*  This is easy day. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2378.5s)]
*  Because war is fucking crazy. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2380.5s)]
*  It's like how much have you seen, how much have you had to deal with? [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2384.14s)]
*  That's why rich kids and spoiled kids, they have such a hard time navigating life. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2389.7799999999997s)]
*  Look at Hunter Biden. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2395.46s)]
*  Look at that poor bastard. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2396.46s)]
*  If that guy was your dad, if your dad was the fucking vice president and he was never [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2398.7s)]
*  home, you'd probably be dealing coke too. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2402.42s)]
*  You'd probably be in Vietnam smoking crack with street hookers, taking pictures of your [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2404.54s)]
*  dick. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2408.66s)]
*  Why not? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2409.66s)]
*  That guy's got a huge dick for always on coke. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2410.66s)]
*  He doesn't get coke dick. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2413.14s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2414.22s)]
*  Sure is taking Viagra too. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2415.22s)]
*  It's a fucking hog for a dude on crack. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2416.22s)]
*  Well, I never looked, but congratulations. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2419.14s)]
*  Yeah, I have to do research. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2420.66s)]
*  Somebody asked me, they had a copy of the entire laptop. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2422.66s)]
*  They said, do you want it? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2425.18s)]
*  I said, no. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2426.18s)]
*  I do not want that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2427.18s)]
*  Why do you want that? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2428.18s)]
*  I do not want that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2429.18s)]
*  I don't want to be in possession of that. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2430.18s)]
*  But also, isn't it illegal? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2431.94s)]
*  That's not yours. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2436.66s)]
*  Things on there seem illegal. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2437.66s)]
*  Well, I'm sure there's activities that seem illegal, but isn't it illegal to be in possession [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2438.66s)]
*  of someone's private property that was copied without their knowledge? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2443.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2447.22s)]
*  I don't think that's illegal. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2448.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2449.22s)]
*  You don't want that. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2450.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2451.22s)]

*  When they inject child porn into someone's laptop, they do that one all the time. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2455.64s)]
*  They do that one all the time. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2463.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's really scary. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2464.94s)]
*  You did that to the brother. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2466.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, this is not true. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2467.66s)]
*  Let me say this. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2469.66s)]
*  You don't know how many people they do that to, but they have done it. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2473.82s)]
*  Someone in some intelligence agency has dropped child porn into a person's computer. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2478.42s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2484.38s)]
*  That's a real strategy. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2485.38s)]
*  People have talked about it openly. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2486.38s)]
*  People have been caught on tape talking about it. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2487.38s)]
*  But people get busted, and you're like, oh, how convenient that this guy got caught with [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2490.26s)]
*  child porn. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2495.74s)]

*  One of the guys that got caught with child porn was the brother of the guy who went to [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2499.7799999999997s)]
*  the golf course to try to kill Trump. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2504.2599999999998s)]

*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2517.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2518.22s)]
*  And they just put it on your computer, and then they rage you, and then there's nothing [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2519.22s)]
*  you can do about it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2521.62s)]

*  I agree. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2526.62s)]
*  If you have that on your fucking computer, everybody agrees you should be dead. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2527.62s)]
*  Except some of these crazy professors now who are trying to make the term minor, attractive [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2531.02s)]
*  persons. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2537.18s)]

*  He's like, because the weird thing about that, because there was this whole push about drag [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2543.18s)]
*  queens and, dude, I've been to drag shows. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2549.02s)]
*  They're great. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2551.78s)]
*  Personally, I don't think they need to be reading the kindergartners. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2552.78s)]
*  That's just my personal opinion. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2555.2200000000003s)]
*  And now a lot of them get busted with having weird paths. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2557.7400000000002s)]
*  And the reason I do that is whether it's the child sex changes and all that stuff, it's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2562.1800000000003s)]
*  like most of the people pushing that stuff are in therapy for trauma that occurred to [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2566.86s)]
*  them as children. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2573.34s)]
*  And now they're totally fine with traumatizing children with weird ass shit. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2575.52s)]
*  To me, kindergarten should be A's, B's, C's, adding all, you know, math. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2581.04s)]
*  It shouldn't be- [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2585.96s)]
*  Play games, football. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2586.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2587.96s)]
*  Drag queens seem like algebra to me. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2588.96s)]
*  Really advanced shit that most adults don't even quite understand. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2590.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, why would you ever push anything sexual to people that haven't even [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2594.88s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2601.2s)]

*  It's gross. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2604.2s)]
*  It's not just gross. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2605.2s)]
*  And we're also ignoring the fact that human beings are extremely malleable. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2607.2s)]
*  You can convince people of all sorts of things. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2612.12s)]
*  You can influence people to do all sorts of things. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2614.48s)]
*  We know that. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2617.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why cults exist, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2618.2799999999997s)]
*  That's why you can get- [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2619.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2620.2799999999997s)]

*  Because they don't know any better. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2623.64s)]
*  Try getting a 55-year-old guy with a wife and kids and a job to be a suicide bomber. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2625.08s)]
*  He'd be like, what? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2631.0s)]
*  Try getting some fucking guy in New Jersey who takes a train into Manhattan every day. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2632.14s)]

*  For what? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2645.1200000000003s)]
*  They have people that rely on them, and then kids just have nothing, and they're very trusting [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2646.2000000000003s)]
*  of adults too. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2650.1000000000004s)]

*  And then they have framed photographs. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2655.8s)]
*  I remember there was this documentary where there was this school in the Middle East, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2657.96s)]
*  and they were talking about today's students are tomorrow's holy martyrs. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2664.04s)]
*  And it was printed on the wall, and in it they had photographs of various children that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2669.2400000000002s)]
*  had blown themselves up. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2674.44s)]

*  It's so fucked up. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2682.6s)]
*  But that's the playbook. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2683.6s)]
*  The playbook is you get young people that don't know any better because they're easily influenced. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2684.96s)]
*  So in the guise of all this woke shit, people have put aside what's fundamental about human [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2689.72s)]

*  Oh, did you see the latest one? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2714.64s)]
*  The New York Times wrote about this. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2716.4399999999996s)]
*  They did a study on hormone blockers for children and they decided to not release the study- [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2718.32s)]
*  I saw that yesterday. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2724.1200000000003s)]
*  Because the study would empower people who against- go to J.K. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2725.26s)]
*  Rawlings' tweet. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2729.92s)]

*  If you're going to do a study that proves that hormone blockers are good for children [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2741.86s)]
*  and you find out it's not, the correct thing to do is say, hey, we just found something [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2746.68s)]
*  out and we shouldn't give hormone blockers to kids. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2750.36s)]
*  This is just for happiness sake. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2753.92s)]
*  We must not publish a study that says we're harming children because people who say we're [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2756.04s)]
*  harming children will use this study as evidence that we're harming children, which might make [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2759.4s)]

*  The leader of the long-running study said the drugs did not improve mental health in [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2775.22s)]
*  children with gender distress and that the findings might be weaponized by opponents [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2778.3799999999997s)]
*  of the care. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2782.7s)]

*  they don't have a penis that they can turn into a vagina, so they start using their rectal [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2805.66s)]
*  tissue. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2810.52s)]
*  So then their artificial vagina smells like shit, literally, because it's made out of [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2811.76s)]
*  rectal tissue. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2816.26s)]
*  And so there's all these online forums of people talking about the malodorous fake vaginas [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2818.26s)]
*  that they got from these operations. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2823.22s)]
*  And then you have to keep it dilated. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2825.02s)]
*  It's basically a wound that you got to put in and at some point that wound's going to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2826.94s)]
*  not start smelling good because it's not meant to be there. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2831.18s)]
*  Well, I mean, maybe you could if it was made out of a dick, maybe you can keep it from [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2834.14s)]
*  smelling like anything other than dick. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2837.76s)]
*  It's gonna smell like dick. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2840.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2841.7000000000003s)]
*  But it's like, if you have a pierced ear, sometimes those holes seal up, right? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2842.7000000000003s)]
*  So you have to keep a peg in there. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2849.26s)]
*  You have to keep an earring in there in order to keep the hole open. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2850.78s)]
*  Otherwise, it'll close up and you have to reopen it. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2853.38s)]
*  They have to do that with their fake vaginas. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2856.02s)]
*  They'll heal up. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2858.3s)]
*  And I just don't understand as a parent how you can't go, no, we're not going to do this. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2859.94s)]
*  I don't understand why you would allow the thing that is the most beautiful thing in [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2865.4s)]
*  the world, your child, to go through that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2869.58s)]
*  I don't understand that because my whole thing is protect my children at all costs. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2871.42s)]
*  As much as I can, I protect them from as much as I can. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2877.54s)]
*  And to allow this to happen at that age, be like, yeah, just do a major surgery. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2882.36s)]
*  How early is it? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2889.7s)]
*  10, 12? [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2890.7s)]
*  13. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2891.7s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2892.7s)]
*  Like crazy. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2893.7s)]
*  What kind of parent is that? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2894.7s)]
*  And it's a decision that's going to haunt them for the rest of their life if they don't agree [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2895.7s)]
*  with it. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2898.3399999999997s)]
*  If they're unhappy with it, and there's a lot of detransitioners, a lot. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2899.3399999999997s)]
*  And they get shunned. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2902.98s)]
*  And they get shunned. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2903.98s)]
*  Oh my God, they get attacked so hard. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2904.98s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2907.3799999999997s)]
*  Imagine someone that's been coerced into doing something horrible, ruining, they'll never [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2908.3799999999997s)]
*  have children again, ruin their life. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2912.3399999999997s)]
*  They get older and they realize like, oh, I'm just a gay man. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2914.68s)]
*  Now I don't have a dick. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2917.3399999999997s)]
*  Or, oh, I'm just a girl who had autism and was confused. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2918.7799999999997s)]
*  Now my breasts are removed and I have a deep voice. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2921.54s)]
*  Forever. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2924.18s)]
*  Forever. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2925.18s)]
*  Forever. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2926.18s)]
*  It's so tragic. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2927.18s)]
*  Can't have children forever. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2928.18s)]
*  Your life is ruined in the name of woke and not just that, but also in the name of money. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2929.18s)]
*  This is where it gets fucked. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2933.46s)]
*  Because when you look at the amount of money that's generated by this, like if you go back [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2935.2999999999997s)]
*  to like gender transition surgery places, like gender affirming care centers in like [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2939.18s)]
*  2007, there's a couple. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2945.9s)]
*  There's a few. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2948.9s)]
*  Because there's always been transgender people. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2949.9s)]
*  There's always been people that have gender dysphoria. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2951.62s)]
*  And then there's people that have autogynephilia. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2954.86s)]
*  And the autogynephilia people are the people that are sexually aroused by the idea of dressing [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2957.38s)]
*  up like a woman, but they like women. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2961.1s)]
*  And those are the fucking creeps that walk around women's bathrooms with hard-ons. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2963.26s)]
*  Yeah, that was that swimmer they said that they had that. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2966.1s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2968.82s)]
*  There's been a bunch of them like that. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2969.82s)]
*  They get aroused by the idea of dressing up like a woman, but they're heterosexual. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2971.1s)]
*  And so they're protected under the same banner. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2975.7s)]
*  So you've empowered perverts and molesters to go into women's room and stare at women [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2977.98s)]
*  while they're peeing with their dicks out. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2984.06s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2986.8999999999996s)]
*  They get a kink out of walking around women's locker rooms with their hard-ons. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2987.8999999999996s)]
*  And this is, or their dicks out. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2991.3399999999997s)]
*  But this is just one aspect of it. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2992.7s)]
*  And then there's people that really do have a mind of a woman. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=2996.16s)]
*  They're trapped in a man's body. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3000.3399999999997s)]
*  And maybe gender transition is the thing for them. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3002.14s)]
*  But they should be protected from making a poor decision while they're young. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3004.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3011.3599999999997s)]
*  At 18, light yourself up like a Christmas tree. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3012.3599999999997s)]
*  It really shouldn't even be 18. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3014.6s)]
*  Or 21, 24, 25. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3015.6s)]
*  Whatever it is, whatever age we figure out. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3017.68s)]
*  But people make, especially men, their frontal cortex in a man doesn't even really fully [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3020.64s)]
*  evolve until they're like 25 years old. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3025.6s)]
*  I think mine was 50. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3027.8799999999997s)]
*  I think mine was 50 too. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3029.8799999999997s)]
*  It's interesting because it's this thing we kind of see in society right now in our culture [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3032.12s)]
*  where they're trying to make outlaw shit mainstream. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3036.08s)]
*  Like when I was growing up, there was always that story that there was a city in Colorado [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3039.48s)]
*  where everyone went to get transitioned. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3043.6800000000003s)]
*  And you went out there and that's where you did it. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3045.6s)]
*  You didn't see it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3047.28s)]
*  You got like centers everywhere. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3048.28s)]
*  Yeah, for a long time, Colorado was the place where I always heard you went to go get your [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3049.28s)]
*  dick cut off and stuff like that, right? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3053.48s)]
*  Which is fine. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3056.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, live your life. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3057.2400000000002s)]
*  When I was growing up in a small town, I don't think we had any trans. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3058.2400000000002s)]
*  I think we had maybe one and they lived their life and they lived that outlaw lifestyle. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3061.52s)]
*  Same thing with adult film stars, right? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3067.08s)]
*  Like when I was like, you know, I did the naughty show. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3068.88s)]
*  I interviewed all these adult film stars. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3071.12s)]
*  That was way before OnlyFans and now like your secretary is in OnlyFans and they don't [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3073.4s)]
*  understand the lifestyle that comes with being an outlaw, right? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3077.96s)]
*  Which is like, like there's a reason why porn stars live like the average age is like 38 [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3081.82s)]
*  years old, their lifespan, right? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3086.88s)]
*  There's like, is that real? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3088.32s)]
*  If you go and you start like there's people on YouTube that put together like these in [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3089.56s)]
*  memoriam adult film stars, they're all super young and it's all like ODN suicide murder. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3093.36s)]
*  It's not an easy lifestyle. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3099.92s)]
*  There's certain people that are built for that and it comes from traumas of childhood [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3101.72s)]
*  that, you know, they can't really- [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3104.84s)]
*  I also just imagine the people that you're associating with every day, the men who are [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3105.84s)]
*  pimping you out through these movies. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3109.7999999999997s)]
*  It's an outlaw lifestyle. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3112.04s)]
*  It's same thing with the trans stuff. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3113.48s)]
*  They're trying to make it so the normies are doing it. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3114.96s)]
*  It's like, they're not built for that. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3117.12s)]
*  There's a certain kind of person built for that certain lifestyle. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3118.84s)]
*  That business got wiped out by the internet. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3122.44s)]
*  Remember how there was all these like bailouts of businesses? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3125.2400000000002s)]
*  Isn't it funny that no one bailed out porn? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3128.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's so crazy, dude. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3130.6000000000004s)]
*  It's so crazy, dude. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3132.36s)]
*  I used to live in this gated community, real nice neighborhood, and there was a dude who [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3133.36s)]
*  lived down the street who actually did Jiu Jitsu with me and he was a porn star. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3137.52s)]
*  I know, I think I know what you're talking about. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3141.48s)]
*  And he made porn films and so he was loaded. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3143.28s)]
*  This dude had a fucking fat Mercedes and a beautiful house and his house is apparently [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3146.48s)]
*  like, just a playground. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  Like this, it was just balling out of control and producing porn. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3153.28s)]
*  And then the internet came along and bang, house got repossessed, lost everything. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3157.04s)]
*  Everybody went broke. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3162.8s)]
*  They went from making millions every year to making zero dollars because all the porn [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3163.92s)]
*  was legal and it was all online. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3169.08s)]
*  And it's tubes and you go into why is that a thing? [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3170.84s)]
*  Why is this porn all free? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  Why is that suggestion bar over there suggesting some weird shit to me? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3176.12s)]
*  It just brings you deeper and deeper into the world. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3181.2799999999997s)]
*  You keep clicking on links and links pop up ads and there's banging out ad revenue left [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3183.6s)]
*  and right. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3189.04s)]
*  They were getting some straight, normal ads too, like a Ford truck I once saw in Pornhub, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3190.04s)]
*  which was a really weird commercial before you're about to watch interracial gang bangs. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3195.68s)]
*  I bet all that's done in a sneaky way. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3200.4s)]
*  I bet all that's probably done in a sneaky way. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3203.04s)]
*  I bet the companies don't even know what they're advertising for. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3204.96s)]
*  I bet it's like a block of ad that goes to some conglomerate. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3207.92s)]
*  You got to think of how much money must be involved in those streaming sites now. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3212.56s)]
*  And how many views are getting? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3216.04s)]
*  If you go to a video, it's got three million views. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3217.84s)]
*  Why is that any different than watching a standup special that has three million views? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3220.0s)]
*  Because you're not paying attention to the fucking ads on the right hand side because [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3224.28s)]
*  you're going full screen every time. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3227.7200000000003s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3230.92s)]
*  But the game changed and I always think this is like kind of a... [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3231.96s)]
*  Here it is right here. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3235.32s)]
*  In 2006, pornography industry generated 12 billion in annual revenue, which is more than [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3237.2400000000002s)]
*  the combined annual revenues of ABC, NBC, and CBS. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3243.2000000000003s)]
*  In 2023, the pornographic website market in the US projected to be valued at 1 billion. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3248.2400000000002s)]
*  So they lost 11 billion. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3253.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3254.8s)]
*  That's with all the rebounding. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3255.8s)]
*  That's the rebounding, right? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3257.32s)]
*  So there was a complete devastation from 2006, which is right about the time that this fucking [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3258.88s)]
*  dude lost his house. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3264.76s)]
*  I think he lost his house like 2008 or something like that. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3265.96s)]
*  So they just... [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3268.86s)]
*  Once the YouPorn and all that shit came along, it just took the fucking legs off of it. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3269.86s)]
*  But the 2023 one doesn't include the OnlyFans numbers. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3277.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's got to be off the charts. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3279.84s)]
*  That is crazy too and that's an interesting thing. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3282.2000000000003s)]
*  That is the most empowering way for porn stars, right? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3285.32s)]
*  Because they are completely... [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3289.02s)]
*  They get rid of the pimp. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3290.02s)]
*  They get rid of the pimp, they get rid of the producers, they make their own revenue. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3291.02s)]
*  And a lot of it is like boyfriends and girlfriends decide to film fucking amateur stuff and people [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3294.28s)]
*  love that stuff. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3299.2000000000003s)]
*  And that is like an insane amount of money. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3300.44s)]
*  And they're making it. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3304.5600000000004s)]
*  They're making all of it, which that's the most reasonable... [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3305.5600000000004s)]
*  Some of them are. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3307.6000000000004s)]
*  I think there's this big thing where they're like, this chick made a million dollars. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3308.6000000000004s)]
*  And then you study what the average person makes. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3312.48s)]
*  It's like $100. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3315.52s)]
*  I saw this great meme where it's like you started OnlyFans, you made $10, but now everybody [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3316.68s)]
*  in your town knows you have pepperoni nipples. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3321.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's definitely that. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3327.72s)]
*  It's not always successful. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3328.96s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3330.96s)]
*  The median income for OnlyFans creators is $4,995 a year, according to Keeper, tax filing [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3331.96s)]
*  service for the freelance workers. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3338.2s)]
*  It is likely some creators make a lot of money, while others make none at all. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3339.7999999999997s)]
*  So for the median to be $4,995, that means some girls are making $20. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3343.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3348.04s)]
*  Yeah, some girls are making 20 bucks. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3349.04s)]
*  So what was my point? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3350.04s)]
*  My point was... [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3351.7s)]
*  The point is it used to be an organized kind of like a real industry, and now it's not [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3353.48s)]
*  that and it's Wild West and everybody's doing these... [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3360.44s)]
*  You know what's really weird, dude, is how similar comedians and porn stars' business [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3364.44s)]
*  models are. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3369.48s)]
*  They're almost exactly the same if you study it, right? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3370.66s)]
*  It's like we have podcasts, they have OnlyFans, right? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3374.04s)]
*  They put clips up on Twitter, which is wild, but Twitter still... [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3377.56s)]
*  Twitter during all the censorship, still full on hardcore porn always on Twitter, which [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3381.8s)]
*  is really crazy that nobody pushed back against that. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3390.6s)]
*  That never went away. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3393.48s)]
*  And snuff films. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3395.8s)]
*  It's so crazy to me. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3397.0s)]
*  That's a lot of Instagram. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3398.78s)]
*  Instagram is a lot of murder. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3399.78s)]
*  I watched a guy today get stomped to death that same video, the guy got stomped to death [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3401.72s)]
*  by the elephant. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3405.2400000000002s)]
*  I had to watch it again. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3406.2400000000002s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3407.2400000000002s)]
*  Dude, it is crazy. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3408.72s)]
*  My algorithm on Instagram, I hate it, dude. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3410.52s)]
*  I hate it. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3413.04s)]
*  It's all buttholes, dude. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3414.04s)]
*  So many people dying. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3415.84s)]
*  I can't get away from it. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3416.84s)]
*  Red Band got me turned on to ladies who find the loophole to show their tits by breastfeeding [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3417.84s)]
*  face fake babies. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3422.72s)]
*  So they have this big juicy tit and they pull this hot girl in a sundress, pulls out this [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3423.72s)]
*  big juicy tit and sticks it in the mouth of a rubber baby and you're like, hey. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3428.48s)]
*  I was at the airport flying here and I love children, especially now I have kids, I realize [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3437.2799999999997s)]
*  how magical they are. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3442.04s)]
*  And you go to airports, you don't see kids like you used to when I was coming up. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3443.6s)]
*  It's just, nobody's having kids anymore, at least that's what they're telling us. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3446.9199999999996s)]
*  That's why we need immigrants, Sam. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3450.88s)]
*  That's why we need to keep the borders open, Sam. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3453.52s)]
*  I see that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3454.96s)]
*  Dude, even like, even Mexico's birth rates going down. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3455.96s)]
*  It's like Mexicans are having kids now, dude, that's crazy. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3459.48s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3461.88s)]
*  Yeah, like, dude, I saw this chart which stated like the birth rates of all these countries. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3462.88s)]
*  It is not the only place that's only down 20% in Jamaica. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3467.3599999999997s)]
*  They're still dropping dick. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3471.6s)]
*  Nobody else is. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3472.6s)]
*  Well, they probably don't have a lot of plastic over there. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3473.6s)]
*  The part of it is reproductive cycles are being devastated by plastic. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3476.52s)]
*  Dude, we're entering our children to men phase, dude. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3480.84s)]
*  I'm telling you, bro. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3483.92s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3486.12s)]
*  Remember that movie? [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3487.12s)]
*  It was like ridiculous. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3488.12s)]
*  Everybody was like, that's crazy. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3489.12s)]
*  Yeah, now like everything's militarized and nobody's having kids. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3490.12s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3493.28s)]
*  I mean, it's going to get to a point where abortion rights are going to be moot. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3494.28s)]
*  It's not really important because nobody can have kids. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3497.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's really sad, dude. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3499.6s)]
*  It's weird because this is what happens in industrialized civilizations anyway. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3502.28s)]
*  So whenever you have like cities, what happens is women enter the workforce so they have [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3507.1200000000003s)]
*  children later. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3511.0s)]
*  And then men want to have children later as well because everybody's focusing on their [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3512.32s)]
*  career. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3516.0400000000004s)]
*  And then you have IVF centers and everything because people are too old to have kids. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3517.0400000000004s)]
*  They're late 30s like, oh my God, we have to do something to have a kid. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3520.5600000000004s)]
*  We don't have any time. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3523.6800000000003s)]
*  Freeze the embryos. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3524.6800000000003s)]
*  Do whatever we got to do. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3525.76s)]
*  And so it's normal for third world countries to have more kids. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3527.2s)]
*  It's always been the case because you need children because you need children to help [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3532.68s)]
*  you work. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3535.4399999999996s)]
*  If you're working on a farm or a ranch or you need kids and then you get to cities and [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3536.4399999999996s)]
*  people are like, well, the wife wants a career as well. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3541.3599999999997s)]
*  Birth rates always drop. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3546.2s)]

*  But there was also that dead period at the store where it was like we could just go up [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3868.6800000000003s)]
*  and bomb with dignity and nobody cared. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3873.06s)]
*  There was nobody in the O'Rour. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3875.46s)]
*  You were just eating a dick and you felt great about yourself because it was like towards [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3877.58s)]
*  the end of Mitzi's like she was still in control, but she wasn't like hands on. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3881.22s)]
*  That was 2007 to 14. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3885.42s)]
*  Yeah, it was just, that's when I was gone. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3887.46s)]
*  No, no, it was right before you left too. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3889.46s)]
*  I loved you. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3892.38s)]
*  You were the only one putting your name on the marquee still. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3893.38s)]
*  You know, you'd have these guys popping in doing an hour, their name weren't on the marquee. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3896.1s)]
*  It was chaos, man. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3899.98s)]
*  But the reason why they did that is because they had this erroneous idea that you wouldn't [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3901.34s)]
*  sell tickets in LA if your name was at the Comedy Store. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3904.42s)]
*  People knew they could see at the Comedy Store. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3908.0600000000004s)]
*  Why would they go see you at the Forum? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3909.82s)]
*  And I was always like, who says who? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3912.1000000000004s)]
*  So I always appreciated you putting your name on marquee because we got to perform in front [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3916.34s)]
*  of like packed crowds. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3919.6200000000003s)]
*  But during the week, I remember I'd walk up, Steve Reniziz is still working at the cash [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3921.1800000000003s)]
*  register and he's like, should I get a new job? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3925.78s)]
*  You'd look in, there's like 10 people in the O'Rour. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3928.2200000000003s)]
*  I was like 94 to like 2003. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3930.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3935.9s)]
*  And I got in in 98. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3936.9s)]
*  I always said it's the purest comedy ever was because the inmates were running the asylum [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3939.1800000000003s)]
*  and you could just be, you could go do a set, do blow over there, have a great time, live [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3944.7400000000002s)]
*  your life. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3948.86s)]
*  And it was such a blessing because everybody that was there during that time has gone on [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3950.1000000000004s)]
*  to do amazing things. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3954.54s)]
*  They're all over Netflix, their podcasts are huge because we were allowed to just bomb [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3955.7000000000003s)]
*  with dignity. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3960.14s)]
*  We were allowed to experiment. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3962.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3963.5s)]
*  Which is so important for creating comedy. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3964.02s)]
*  You got to take chances and you got to try things. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3965.98s)]
*  And if you're just trying to kill all the time, you're going to do your best material [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3968.94s)]
*  always. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3972.1s)]
*  And the store kind of got to be that for a while. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3972.9s)]
*  Like 2000. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3976.38s)]
*  Before COVID. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3977.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3978.18s)]
*  14 on. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3978.62s)]
*  The problem was it was packed every night. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3979.94s)]
*  When I came back, all of a sudden it was like the new gold rush. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3981.94s)]
*  And it was every night, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, two shows, three shows, sold out. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3985.2999999999997s)]
*  Everything was sold out. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3990.02s)]
*  Two shows in the main room. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3991.02s)]
*  Sold out. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3992.2599999999998s)]
*  Amazing crowds. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3992.94s)]
*  Enthusiastic comedy fans. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3994.18s)]
*  It was because they were internet comedy fans. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3996.02s)]
*  It became like a different thing because it was before, it was like, ah, let's go see comedy. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=3998.2599999999998s)]
*  They didn't give a fuck about comedy. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4002.2599999999998s)]
*  So if you got a laugh, you earned that fucking laugh. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4003.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4006.42s)]
*  You know? [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4006.78s)]
*  The way I always say is the store goes through these different eras, right? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4008.3s)]
*  So it went through the Richard Pryor era. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4012.54s)]
*  When Richard Pryor was filming live in the Sunset Strip in like the early 80s, I mean, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4015.58s)]
*  this was like the thing. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4020.7799999999997s)]
*  Like you'd go see Richard Pryor at the Comedy Store. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4022.34s)]
*  And I'm sure the Comedy Store, from everybody that like Dom Herrera and people I talked to, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4025.34s)]
*  was hopping back then. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4029.18s)]
*  And then there was the Kinnison era. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4030.94s)]
*  And then Kinnison, I think around 88, got banned from the store. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4033.34s)]
*  And something happened. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4037.94s)]
*  And I don't know what he did. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4039.5s)]
*  He probably shot somebody or something. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4040.5s)]
*  I know he shot one of the signs. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4042.02s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4044.5s)]
*  In the back, in the parking lot. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4044.94s)]
*  Yeah, they replaced the sign. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4046.2200000000003s)]
*  Like so sad. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4047.14s)]
*  It's like, dude, that was a bullet hole from Kinnison. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4047.7400000000002s)]
*  Why would you fix that? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4050.82s)]
*  Leave it there. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4051.9s)]
*  So then after that, there was this giant drop off. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4052.94s)]
*  That's when I came along. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4057.1s)]
*  I came along in 94. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4058.06s)]
*  There was no one there. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4059.3s)]
*  It was like I had heard about the Comedy Store was Mecca. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4060.46s)]
*  When I lived in Boston, everybody was like, the Comedy Store. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4063.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4067.78s)]
*  Richard Pryor. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4068.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4068.9s)]
*  Sam Kinnison, Dave Letterman. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4069.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4070.7400000000002s)]
*  Bill Hicks. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4071.06s)]
*  Comedy Store. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4071.7400000000002s)]
*  The Comedy Store. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4072.38s)]
*  It was like this magnet you had to get to. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4073.5s)]
*  I got to get to the Comedy Store. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4076.18s)]
*  And then when I got there, I was like, what? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4077.62s)]
*  It was like, boat acts. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4079.62s)]
*  It was like the leftovers, the people [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4080.86s)]
*  that were around in the 70s and the 80s, but never. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4082.7000000000003s)]
*  They were lazy. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4086.34s)]
*  They were fucked up. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4087.34s)]
*  They never got their shit together. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4088.18s)]
*  And they had these terrible acts. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4089.64s)]
*  And I remember being there. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4091.38s)]
*  And the crowd was like nonexistent. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4092.7000000000003s)]
*  No one was there. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4094.5s)]
*  I was like, wow, this is the Comedy Store? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4095.3s)]
*  And it was like that for a couple years. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4097.74s)]
*  Many years. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4100.58s)]
*  When you came in 98, it was like that in 98. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4101.82s)]
*  So it was 94 till around the internet. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4105.099999999999s)]
*  And then the internet started getting the Comedy Store packed [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4109.62s)]
*  again, because we were all on like only, not only fans, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4113.0599999999995s)]
*  so on MySpace. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4116.42s)]
*  We were all advertising shows on MySpace. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4117.66s)]
*  And that got the, Dane Cook led that. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4119.74s)]
*  Dane Cook changed the game, I always say. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4122.54s)]
*  That was like 2002-ish, somewhere around then, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4124.38s)]
*  2002-3. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4128.139999999999s)]
*  That's when it really fucking kicked in. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4129.5s)]
*  And then Fear Factor was huge. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4131.54s)]
*  So then My Name was in the marquee back then. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4133.5s)]
*  So then it was packed again. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4135.38s)]
*  And then it was internet fans. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4136.66s)]
*  So it was a totally different vibe. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4139.3s)]
*  It was like a really fucking good time. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4140.9800000000005s)]
*  But then 2007, I left. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4143.58s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck this place. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4145.3s)]
*  And then it dropped off again. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4146.74s)]
*  It dropped off again. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4147.9s)]
*  And I remember when you came back, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4149.38s)]
*  I remember I wasn't in town. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4152.42s)]
*  It was a big event. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4154.18s)]
*  And everyone's so excited. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4155.68s)]
*  And the things just changed. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4156.94s)]
*  And it just became just fire. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4158.18s)]
*  Overnight. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4160.06s)]
*  There, overnight. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4160.66s)]
*  Overnight. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4161.5s)]
*  But I always could tell whether you or Joey Diaz [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4162.0199999999995s)]
*  was on the lineup. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4165.62s)]
*  Because when you weren't on the lineup, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4166.9s)]
*  the crowds were totally different. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4168.54s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, Tripoli's going to have to work tonight, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4170.26s)]
*  dude. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4172.38s)]
*  It's going to be a rough one. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4173.9s)]
*  We're going to war. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4176.18s)]
*  We're going to lose some soldiers tonight. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4176.9s)]
*  You know if you threw Joey up on the show, first of all, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4178.46s)]
*  whoever goes on after Joey's in real trouble. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4181.38s)]
*  But also, like, you learn a lot about yourself. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4184.46s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4186.9s)]
*  It's an education. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4187.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4188.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4189.3s)]
*  Especially Joey in the OR. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4189.9s)]
*  Joey in the OR was almost impossible to follow. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4191.66s)]
*  And then on top of that, like, all the taboos [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4194.299999999999s)]
*  have been destroyed. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4198.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4199.379999999999s)]
*  He just did 15 minutes on an eating ass [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4199.879999999999s)]
*  and shoving his nose in someone's ass. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4201.9s)]
*  Doing the pigeon. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4205.46s)]
*  And destroyed the room. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4208.42s)]
*  Like, people couldn't breathe. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4209.94s)]
*  They were laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4211.139999999999s)]
*  People were knocking drinks over the table, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4212.54s)]
*  falling onto the ground. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4213.98s)]
*  It was normal to see people fall on the ground [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4215.099999999999s)]
*  when Joey was on stage. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4217.0199999999995s)]
*  But the thing is, it's like all the taboos were shattered, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4218.7s)]
*  and you could just have fun. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4221.62s)]
*  You know, you could just do anything. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4223.26s)]
*  You could just have a good time. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4224.78s)]
*  I felt like that at your club last night. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4225.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4227.9s)]
*  I felt like that. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4228.62s)]
*  Like, it was so funny because I came out [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4229.86s)]
*  and I did Kill Tony two weeks ago. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4231.86s)]
*  And you know, I took Tony on his first road gig. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4234.22s)]
*  You can actually watch. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4237.46s)]
*  There's a video on YouTube where I used to do something [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4239.179999999999s)]
*  called Before and After. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4242.54s)]
*  And I would interview, like, I'd take door guys on the road. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4244.7s)]
*  I'd interview them before the show. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4247.22s)]
*  And then I would interview them after the show [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4248.740000000001s)]
*  because I know it was going to be chaos. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4250.46s)]
*  And you can see Tony's first gig. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4252.26s)]
*  He ever did on the road. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4254.02s)]
*  He's on the internet. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4255.3s)]
*  And now, you know, and I did like Kill Tony super early. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4257.22s)]
*  So you know, that's kind of how I [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4260.900000000001s)]
*  thought the show was, how it was when it first started. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4262.34s)]
*  So I call up Red Band. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4265.820000000001s)]
*  I hit up Red Band and told him, like, hey, man, my special's [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4267.26s)]
*  on. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4269.42s)]
*  Can I come and do the show? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4269.62s)]
*  He's like, yeah, come on. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4270.780000000001s)]
*  So I'd be telling people, like, hey, dude, I'm doing Kill Tony. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4271.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like I'm having a kid. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4274.740000000001s)]
*  Like, I'm going to have a new child come into the world. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4277.38s)]
*  People are like, I'm so happy for you. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4279.58s)]
*  You deserve it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4281.62s)]
*  You're doing great. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4282.9s)]
*  You deserve it. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4284.38s)]
*  I didn't realize what I was walking into. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4285.78s)]
*  Bro, you should have come to Madison Square Garden. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4287.78s)]
*  When you see it. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4291.18s)]
*  I don't know why I didn't go. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4291.74s)]
*  I was like, dude, why didn't you go? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4293.02s)]
*  I go, we could have done that. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4294.46s)]
*  We could have gone. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4296.3s)]
*  I didn't even think about it. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4297.02s)]
*  You could have done a set. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4298.14s)]
*  I wish I could have gone. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4299.06s)]
*  Kill Tony in Madison Square Garden was so insane. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4300.02s)]
*  So for me, it was so emotional. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4303.34s)]
*  I had to be there, because I was there [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4306.22s)]
*  when he was doing it in front of 18 comics in the Belly Row. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4308.58s)]
*  Yes, I was there too. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4311.18s)]
*  No audience. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4312.820000000001s)]
*  I was a frequent guest. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4313.9400000000005s)]
*  And it was just fun. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4315.58s)]
*  It was just the thing we would do. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4316.66s)]
*  We'd fuck around. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4317.860000000001s)]
*  And I thought it was a great workshop for comedy. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4318.62s)]
*  I thought it was a great way for these amateurs, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4320.900000000001s)]
*  these people that are doing One Minute, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4323.3s)]
*  to kind of get feedback from guys like Dom Arera [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4325.46s)]
*  and to kind of figure out how to do comedy. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4328.900000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit of a training wheel for doing comedy. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4332.1s)]
*  Also, tremendous pressure, even back then. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4334.86s)]
*  But imagine, someone went up in Madison Square Garden. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4338.0199999999995s)]
*  It was their first time on stage. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4340.38s)]
*  Where do you go from there? [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4343.139999999999s)]
*  You don't. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4344.5s)]
*  You don't. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4345.339999999999s)]
*  The bombing was horrendous. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4345.82s)]
*  But 16,000 people and rabid Kill Tony fans [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4347.42s)]
*  in front of this amazing band now. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4352.5s)]
*  And you got Dice Clay's there. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4354.82s)]
*  Shane Gillis is there. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4356.7s)]
*  Mark Norma. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4358.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's fucking bananas. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4358.66s)]
*  It was bananas. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4360.9s)]
*  Dave Attell. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4361.9s)]
*  I wish I would have. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4362.58s)]
*  It was incredible. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4363.099999999999s)]
*  I didn't even think to go. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4363.98s)]
*  I was like, man, why didn't I go? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4365.0199999999995s)]
*  All my friends were there. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4366.58s)]
*  I saw Ari Renizzi. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4367.58s)]
*  I wish I talked to you about it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4368.66s)]

*  I would have loved to. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4371.379999999999s)]
*  It was fucking amazing. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4372.339999999999s)]
*  But I'm there, right? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4373.379999999999s)]
*  I'm there. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4374.82s)]
*  And I do Kill Tony. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4376.139999999999s)]
*  And I just feel this freedom I haven't felt in a long time. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4377.379999999999s)]
*  There's a shadow in the cave in Hollywood of cancel culture. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4381.74s)]
*  And people are just afraid. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4387.78s)]
*  I mean, they're just afraid. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4389.7s)]
*  Well, they're also afraid of not getting gigs. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4390.94s)]
*  So the problem with LA is that even the comics that [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4393.22s)]
*  were really good at one point in time, [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4397.1s)]
*  they started getting TV gigs. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4398.7s)]
*  And then they backed off. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4400.5s)]
*  They backed off what they did. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4401.58s)]
*  And I felt that. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4403.1s)]
*  When I was on news radio, my fucking producer [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4404.9400000000005s)]
*  said to me, he goes, why are you still doing comedy? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4407.34s)]

*  My immediate thought was like, oh, no. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4413.42s)]
*  I could get stuck here doing this. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4416.02s)]
*  I was just doing this for money. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4418.46s)]
*  I was doing this because I couldn't believe someone [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4420.02s)]

*  That's insanity. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4425.860000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, my god. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4427.26s)]
*  I'm a baller. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4428.38s)]
*  It was 1994. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4429.9400000000005s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4431.18s)]
*  Young Joe. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4432.620000000001s)]
*  26 years old. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4433.820000000001s)]
*  And I'm making this insane amount of money. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4434.820000000001s)]
*  This is nuts. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4436.900000000001s)]
*  And so I went from that to this realization [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4438.5s)]
*  that this could be a trap. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4442.700000000001s)]
*  And I was like, oh, no. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4444.58s)]
*  I'm doubling down. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4445.5s)]
*  I'm going to get after it. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4446.54s)]
*  I'm going to really, really get after it with comedy. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4447.780000000001s)]
*  I'm going to do the same kind of comedy. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4450.1s)]
*  And I've thought about that during the Fear Factor days, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4452.18s)]
*  too. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4454.02s)]
*  And I'm like, if I lose Fear Factor because of comedy, [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4454.660000000001s)]
*  so be it. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4457.1s)]
*  But I am not. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4458.22s)]
*  Dude, that's why I love you. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4459.22s)]
*  You're such a word. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4460.5s)]
*  You love the art. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4461.54s)]
*  I've always felt that from you. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4462.700000000001s)]
*  You've always loved the art. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4464.3s)]
*  And I've always totally respected that in you. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4465.54s)]
*  Because you could have slide. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4468.14s)]
*  And I know you take a notepad, and you write, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4469.620000000001s)]
*  and you work those bits, and you listen to yourself. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4474.02s)]
*  And you always, always fine tune it. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4476.46s)]
*  And that's why when you're special [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4478.74s)]
*  and you did it live, which is fucking bananas, I loved it, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4480.179999999999s)]
*  dude. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4483.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4484.34s)]
*  I was so happy for you because I know [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4484.54s)]
*  how much time you put into it. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4486.26s)]
*  Well, it's also doing it live is like scary. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4487.78s)]
*  It's crazy, dude. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4489.74s)]
*  Which is why I wanted to do it live. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4490.7s)]
*  I was like, fuck it. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4492.46s)]
*  Let's do it live. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4493.46s)]
*  It was great, dude. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4494.099999999999s)]
*  Let's do it like fucking Bill O'Reilly. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4494.66s)]
*  Fuck it. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4496.219999999999s)]
*  We'll do it live. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4496.7s)]
*  Bro, it's so nuts. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4497.66s)]
*  Because most people, people don't [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4500.86s)]
*  notice about specials, is most people record multiple shows. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4502.86s)]
*  So they could edit it together so they [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4506.74s)]
*  get the best representation. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4509.42s)]
*  To go up there and like, last night I [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4511.46s)]
*  did the smaller room in your club. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4515.0599999999995s)]
*  And there was a couple moments where I flubbed some words. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4516.62s)]
*  And I was like, don't crash the plane. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4519.9s)]
*  Don't crash the plane. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4522.5s)]
*  Stay in the pocket, dude. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4524.3s)]
*  You just flubbed a couple words. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4525.46s)]
*  It's OK. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4526.98s)]
*  And then you write it, and then you go. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4527.9s)]
*  To do it live is crazy. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4530.86s)]
*  But you know what it made me realize? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4533.42s)]
*  That I could do more in regular comedy. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4535.06s)]
*  Like, I could work more. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4538.9800000000005s)]
*  I could work harder. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4540.26s)]
*  You know, you remember the movie Mobyta Blues? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4541.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4544.02s)]
*  Loved that movie. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4544.46s)]
*  One of the things I loved about that movie [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4545.42s)]
*  was like the discipline that Denzel Washington's character [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4546.82s)]
*  had. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4549.38s)]
*  Like his girlfriend's trying to fuck. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4549.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like, no, no, no. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4551.22s)]
*  I got to practice. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4551.86s)]
*  I got to practice. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4552.62s)]
*  I'm like, I don't even practice. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4553.26s)]
*  I was thinking that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4554.7s)]
*  I hardly practice. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4555.42s)]
*  I hardly write. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4556.58s)]
*  I think about that all the time. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4557.3s)]
*  I write occasionally. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4558.02s)]
*  I would write, back then especially. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4559.18s)]
*  I write a lot more now. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4560.82s)]
*  But I would write occasionally. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4561.78s)]
*  I sit down and write. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4563.7s)]
*  When I got ready for the special, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4564.62s)]
*  I was writing every day. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4565.94s)]
*  And I was going over my bits every day. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4567.58s)]
*  I was listening to them. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4570.259999999999s)]
*  I was writing them down. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4571.66s)]
*  I was writing them out the day of the show. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4572.94s)]
*  I respect that. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4575.42s)]
*  I had done them thousands of times. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4575.9s)]
*  But I was writing them out the day of the show. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4577.3s)]
*  I was listening to recordings. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4579.82s)]
*  I watched a film of the recording. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4581.179999999999s)]
*  I was like, I am going to be dialed the fuck in. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4583.38s)]
*  And then when I did it, I was like, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4586.0199999999995s)]
*  why don't I do this all the time? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4587.0599999999995s)]
*  Like, if I did that all the time, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4588.42s)]
*  everything would be so much better. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4589.9s)]
*  How do you have time, bro? [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4591.42s)]
*  How do you keep all this stuff going? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4592.82s)]
*  I know I'm big. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4594.7s)]
*  Like, I got in yesterday and I wanted to text you. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4595.7s)]
*  But I'm like, oh, dude, he's so busy. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4597.86s)]
*  I'm just going to let him do his thing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4599.42s)]
*  My phone's constantly blowing up. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4601.18s)]
*  And I'm not even close to it. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4602.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know how you keep everything going. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4604.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's amazing to me. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4607.14s)]
*  Because I'm constantly on the verge of like, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4609.74s)]
*  I'm just going to fake my own death and disappear. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4612.26s)]
*  Well, one day I'll probably disappear. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4615.9400000000005s)]
*  But what I'm doing is exactly the amount I can do. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4617.82s)]
*  So I have it in a good situation. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4622.179999999999s)]
*  So my situation is I work out in the morning [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4625.58s)]
*  while my kids are at school. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4628.0599999999995s)]
*  I come here. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4629.259999999999s)]
*  I do the podcast. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4630.54s)]
*  And then I do stand up at night when everybody's going to bed. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4632.179999999999s)]
*  And that's what I did in LA, too. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4635.94s)]
*  Like, a lot of those shows that I did, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4637.299999999999s)]
*  like Joe Rogan and Friends Show I did in the main room, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4638.62s)]
*  I did them at 10 o'clock. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4640.74s)]
*  And the reason I did at 10 o'clock, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4642.139999999999s)]
*  my kids are already in bed. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4643.34s)]
*  So it's perfect. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4644.54s)]
*  I have dinner, hang out with family, go. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4645.42s)]
*  And then I write late at night, because that's [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4648.3s)]
*  when I'm the most juicy. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4650.46s)]
*  When I come home from a show and my brain's fired up, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4651.82s)]
*  and I can sit in front of a computer, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4655.34s)]
*  and maybe I said one thing that I think could be something. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4657.9800000000005s)]
*  And then I'll just listen to that thing. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4660.66s)]
*  And I'll just start writing. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4661.9800000000005s)]
*  And I've gotten so much out of that. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4663.3s)]
*  And it made me angry that I didn't do it more often. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4665.58s)]
*  Because some of the best bits that I've come up [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4668.22s)]
*  with over the last couple of years [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4670.42s)]
*  have all been stuff that I actually wrote, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4671.9s)]
*  not just ideas that came to me that I fleshed out on stage. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4674.1s)]
*  And I've had some of those that became bangers. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4677.18s)]
*  But the sitting down and writing things out [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4679.780000000001s)]
*  and trying to get my perspective, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4683.34s)]
*  and some lines that were just, we lost a lot of people [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4684.58s)]
*  during COVID, and most of them are still alive. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4688.02s)]
*  I love that. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4690.02s)]
*  I wrote that. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4690.58s)]
*  I was like, that's exactly what it is. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4691.14s)]
*  We lost those people. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4693.26s)]
*  But that came out of writing. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4694.620000000001s)]
*  A lot of these things that I was writing out, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4696.14s)]
*  I took chunks of them, and that became the bits. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4699.06s)]
*  And I was like, god damn it, I got to be more focused. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4701.54s)]
*  So doing that live special really lit a fire under my ass. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4703.82s)]
*  It's so insane, dude. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4707.219999999999s)]
*  People have no clue how hard that is. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4708.98s)]
*  And anyone who's ever shot a special has to be like, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4711.38s)]
*  that's insanity, dude, to do that. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4713.9s)]
*  Because most people don't have the ability to do that. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4715.74s)]
*  And I respect you. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4718.46s)]
*  And I've always done that, because you [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4719.38s)]
*  do have the discipline. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4720.94s)]
*  And now that I've gotten sober, that's [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4721.94s)]
*  what I work on is discipline, getting into a routine [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4725.219999999999s)]
*  of going work out, get this done. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4728.98s)]
*  And now, I'm going to be honest with you, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4730.7s)]
*  I always was a stagewriter. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4732.62s)]
*  I mostly just wrote on stage, tagged it, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4734.66s)]
*  and could remember it, and get the beats down in my head. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4737.3s)]
*  But now that, like in November, I'll [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4742.0599999999995s)]
*  be doing stand-up for 30 years. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4743.78s)]
*  Most people are retiring from whatever [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4746.1s)]
*  they're doing at that time. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4747.7s)]
*  I still absolutely love stand-up comedy. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4748.86s)]
*  But now, I've kind of talked about all the things. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4753.0199999999995s)]
*  I really used to get downloads, dude. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4755.38s)]
*  I would get downloads of jokes. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4757.74s)]
*  Jokes would come to me fully formed. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4759.58s)]
*  And I would just go on stage and do them. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4762.42s)]
*  I remember one day, I'm sleeping. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4764.58s)]
*  I just wake up. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4766.42s)]
*  I'm like, the seven stages of grief [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4767.1s)]
*  are shitting your pants. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4769.38s)]
*  I just had the joke right there. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4770.5s)]
*  And it's like this, I did it on my special. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4772.38s)]
*  And it's a great bit. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4774.26s)]
*  But now, I've kind of tapped into everything. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4775.46s)]
*  And I heard Doug Stanhope talk about this one time, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4778.62s)]
*  where he's like, I talked about everything I cared about. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4782.42s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what Doug told me? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4785.18s)]
*  Edibles changed all that for him. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4786.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know, Paul. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4789.9400000000005s)]
*  Dude, that's the steroids of comedy. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4790.98s)]
*  I'm thinking about, December 9th will be four years. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4794.299999999999s)]
*  I'm so thankful for my sobriety. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4798.58s)]
*  I do want a microdose during jujitsu, but that's about it. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4800.7s)]
*  That's the one thing I have. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4804.299999999999s)]
*  Listen, you don't have to. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4805.299999999999s)]
*  You don't have to do drugs. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4806.94s)]
*  You can stay on this path and be incredibly [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4808.459999999999s)]
*  creative without drugs. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4812.66s)]
*  It's just some people drugs are not good for. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4814.339999999999s)]
*  Just like some people shouldn't eat peanuts. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4816.459999999999s)]
*  Well, it's just the point is, now I'm sitting down and writing. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4818.3s)]
*  And I'm sitting down. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4822.42s)]
*  And my goal is at night to do 30 minutes of stretching, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4823.9400000000005s)]
*  30 minutes of writing, and then 30 minutes of reading. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4827.9400000000005s)]
*  That's 30 more minutes than you would have done if you didn't. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4830.58s)]
*  You add that up. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4833.14s)]
*  That's fucking hours in a week. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4833.9800000000005s)]
*  And you add that up to jokes. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4836.06s)]
*  You're going to have 10 minutes here, five minutes there. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4837.54s)]
*  If you can get one good bit a week, that's about five minutes. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4839.900000000001s)]
*  By the end of the year, you're going [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4842.9400000000005s)]
*  to be like, five good minutes a month. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4844.62s)]
*  You just got to get five good minutes a month. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4846.54s)]
*  Five good minutes a month is amazing. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4848.22s)]
*  And then you have a whole hour at the end of the year. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4849.780000000001s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4852.14s)]
*  And then if you do that for two years, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4852.9400000000005s)]
*  you can pull from 120 minutes down to a murder 60. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4854.62s)]
*  So that's what I'm working on now. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4858.780000000001s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4860.5s)]
*  If you have five good minutes a month, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4861.22s)]
*  you have 12 months out of the year, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4863.62s)]
*  you're going to have 50 fucking minutes. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4865.900000000001s)]
*  Maybe when you trim it down, maybe a little less. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4867.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's pretty fucking good. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4870.700000000001s)]
*  That's pretty goddamn good. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4872.46s)]
*  And I'm trying right now to really work [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4874.3s)]
*  on taking my experiences and turning them into jokes, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4876.62s)]
*  instead of just doing observations, which is fine. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4881.86s)]
*  But I'm trying to take experiences [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4884.9s)]
*  that I feel to make it as authentic as I can to who I am. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4886.66s)]
*  And sometimes I could wander into some stuff where I'm like, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4891.62s)]
*  I'm sure somebody already said that. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4895.82s)]
*  But I'm just like, you know what? [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4897.5s)]
*  It's authentic to me. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4899.0599999999995s)]
*  I have this bit about I almost OD'd on a gas station boner [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4900.14s)]
*  pill one time. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4903.82s)]
*  This is like a true story. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4904.74s)]
*  Did you get it for Red Band? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4906.1s)]
*  No. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4907.26s)]
*  Just one day, I don't know why, I was at a gas station. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4908.740000000001s)]
*  I saw the Rhino 55,000. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4911.22s)]
*  I'm like, give it to me. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4913.22s)]
*  And I was up for three days straight, rock hard. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4914.58s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to die. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4917.42s)]
*  What is in those fucking things? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4918.820000000001s)]
*  I don't know, bro. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4919.9800000000005s)]
*  I think there's steroids in those things. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4921.14s)]
*  I was up, dude. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4923.900000000001s)]
*  And I had jiu-jitsu in the morning. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4924.820000000001s)]
*  I'm like, this is not good. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4926.42s)]
*  Probably meth. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4927.780000000001s)]
*  But I'm probably like, I'm sure somebody [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4928.58s)]
*  might have talked about this. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4930.46s)]
*  But I don't care, because this is my experience. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4931.58s)]
*  And I am just going to write about my experience. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4934.42s)]
*  I'm sure people. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4936.86s)]
*  I mean, Red Band's talked about gas station boner pills. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4937.58s)]
*  Forever. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4940.02s)]
*  Forever. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4940.74s)]
*  He was the fucking guinea pig. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4941.22s)]
*  He would get the different ones. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4944.02s)]
*  He'd be mad when the gas station ran out of him. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4945.54s)]
*  And he was telling me the scam. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4947.7s)]
*  What would happen is they would test these things. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4949.34s)]
*  They'd find out there's Viagra in them [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4952.02s)]
*  and a bunch of other shit. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4953.5s)]
*  And so then they'd pull them off the market. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4954.66s)]
*  And then they would just come up with a new company name [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4956.22s)]
*  and then sell the same shit. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4958.5s)]
*  Thank god. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4959.54s)]
*  And it was like, instead of Rhino, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4960.1s)]
*  steel Rhino, and iron Rhino, and golden Rhino. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4961.46s)]
*  But they're so powerful, bro. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4966.94s)]
*  But how crazy is that? [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4968.58s)]
*  That was a thing for a long time, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4969.9s)]
*  was gas station boner pills. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=4971.94s)]

*  It's not much. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5334.54s)]

*  because I didn't lose any motor control function. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5363.7s)]

*  Ooh. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5517.06s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5544.0599999999995s)]
*  Callan made a big video about it, because he contacted me. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5544.94s)]

*  Kevin James told me about it, because Chris Weidman [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5549.099999999999s)]
*  told him about it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5551.58s)]

*  Oh, shoot. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5558.0199999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5560.46s)]
*  Don't take this stuff. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5562.139999999999s)]
*  Trinity Gold contains, scroll up so I can read that, [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5563.259999999999s)]
*  hidden drug ingredients. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5566.34s)]

*  diclofenac, and phenylbutazone. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5580.1s)]

*  And they're fucking very dangerous. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5592.3s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5596.1s)]
*  Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5597.22s)]
*  may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5600.22s)]
*  such as heart attack and stroke, as well as [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5607.42s)]
*  serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5609.3s)]
*  and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5613.66s)]
*  The hidden drug ingredients may also [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5618.9800000000005s)]
*  interact with other medications and significantly increase [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5620.54s)]
*  the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5624.14s)]
*  use multiple non-steroidal anti-inflammatory [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5626.98s)]
*  containing products. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5629.82s)]
*  So phenbutazone, phenylbutazone is [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5631.86s)]
*  another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5638.099999999999s)]
*  that was discontinued for human use in the United States [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5640.78s)]
*  due to the risk of serious and life-threatening injuries. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5643.099999999999s)]
*  Most serious and life-threatening injury [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5646.5s)]
*  associated with phenylbutazone treatment [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5648.139999999999s)]
*  is bone marrow toxicity, which occurs when the body does not [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5650.78s)]
*  produce enough red blood cells, white blood cells, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5655.42s)]
*  and or platelets. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5658.06s)]
*  Certain types of bone marrow toxicity are reversible. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5659.3s)]
*  However, in rare circumstances, it can lead to death. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5662.38s)]
*  And so why would you take this? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5667.22s)]
*  So Chris Weidman was under the impression [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5669.42s)]
*  that all the stuff in this was natural. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5672.86s)]
*  He got it from this other guy, the guy who manufactures it, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5676.22s)]
*  and he's in business with this guy. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5678.9400000000005s)]
*  So Chris is now doing independent studies on his own [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5680.9400000000005s)]
*  to try to send other versions of it to the lab. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5685.14s)]
*  The guy apparently is saying that he [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5688.02s)]
*  thinks someone sabotaged his product by putting shit in it [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5690.18s)]
*  and then getting it to the FDA and having the FDA test it. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5694.58s)]
*  But another possibility is that this guy is a piece of shit. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5698.34s)]
*  Putting stuff in there that gets you results. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5702.820000000001s)]
*  It'll be resolved. We'll find out. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5705.34s)]
*  But in the meantime, Kevin James, who was taking it, [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5707.34s)]
*  as soon as Brian texted me, I text Kevin. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5711.18s)]

*  look, this is what's in there. He's like, holy shit. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5714.54s)]
*  Damn. I feel bad for fighters [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5716.82s)]
*  because that probably happens more than we probably know, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5719.0199999999995s)]
*  where they take a supplement, they've been told it's fine, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5721.98s)]
*  and then they ... That does happen. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5724.7s)]
*  And then they get popped for steroids or for some ... [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5726.26s)]
*  That's awful. Yeah, it's terrible. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5729.62s)]
*  Especially when, like, Kahlil Roundtree, it was DHEA, [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5731.22s)]
*  which isn't even a performance enhancing supplement. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5736.22s)]
*  It's just a natural supplement, but it's banned. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5738.66s)]
*  So he got popped for that, and he turned himself in [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5742.58s)]
*  because he found out that the substance was in a supplement [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5746.1s)]
*  that they were giving him, and he was like, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5749.780000000001s)]
*  hey, fucking idiots, this shit's banned. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5751.46s)]
*  That sucks. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5753.5s)]
*  So he only got a temporary ban. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5754.54s)]
*  It was only a couple of months because it was clear that A, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5756.06s)]
*  it was not going to have a performance enhancing effect, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5758.860000000001s)]
*  and B, he was very transparent, and in fact, he reported it. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5760.700000000001s)]
*  But there's a lot of guys who get popped [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5765.1s)]
*  because they'll buy some shit from GNC, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5767.18s)]
*  and they think it's, oh, it's fucking muscle builder. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5770.14s)]
*  But meanwhile, there's steroids in those things. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5773.42s)]
*  It's crazy. It feels so bad for those guys. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5774.900000000001s)]
*  Well, when we were first making AlphaBrain, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5777.58s)]
*  we were making it ... [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5779.820000000001s)]
*  What happens is you have a bunch of ingredients, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5781.62s)]
*  you have a proprietary blend that is your supplement, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5784.780000000001s)]
*  whatever you're making, and so all these ingredients [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5789.54s)]
*  in AlphaBrain were shown to enhance cognitive function, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5793.18s)]
*  and so we combined them, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5796.9400000000005s)]
*  we did a bunch of different versions of it, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5798.42s)]
*  came up with one, double-blind placebo controlled, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5799.9400000000005s)]
*  tested at the Boston Center for Memory, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5802.78s)]
*  finds out where we spent a lot of money [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5804.54s)]
*  to make sure this is legit. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5806.22s)]
*  But the company that was making it [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5807.7s)]
*  makes a bunch of other shit too. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5809.78s)]
*  And so we started doing third-party testing [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5811.66s)]
*  of our own product, and we're finding vitamins in there, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5813.9800000000005s)]
*  and creatine, shit that's not supposed to be in there. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5816.26s)]
*  That was just in there because they didn't clean the vats. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5818.58s)]
*  So they're making steroids in one thing, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5821.38s)]
*  and then they clean it out, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5823.46s)]
*  and then they're making gas station dick pills, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5824.58s)]
*  and the next one they clean it out. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5826.9s)]
*  They're not cleaning them. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5828.58s)]
*  That's my girlfriend, Dana has a peanut allergy, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5829.7s)]
*  so she can't even go anywhere near that stuff. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5832.78s)]
*  And even if they cook, they can't cook it somewhere else [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5835.179999999999s)]
*  because you never know how clean the plate is [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5837.54s)]
*  or whatever they're cooking on. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5839.86s)]
*  The peanut allergy is so dangerous, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5841.379999999999s)]
*  they don't even let people eat peanuts on planes anymore [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5842.74s)]
*  because the dust from eating peanuts gets in the air [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5844.62s)]
*  and people can get sick. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5847.179999999999s)]
*  Can you believe they used to, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5848.66s)]
*  I remember when they allowed smoking on a plane. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5849.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5852.179999999999s)]
*  Which is hilarious because that kind of gets into [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5853.0199999999995s)]
*  with the COVID stuff. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5855.5s)]
*  Like the plane has the greatest air filter system out there. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5856.58s)]
*  So you could literally smoke in the front row [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5862.02s)]
*  and like it didn't affect really far in the back. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5864.06s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5865.78s)]
*  I remember being stuck in the back [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5867.98s)]
*  because that was the only place I could get a seat [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5870.5s)]
*  was in the smoking section [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5872.06s)]
*  back when people did smoke on planes. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5873.22s)]
*  That was in the back? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5875.22s)]
*  Yeah, it was in the back. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5876.42s)]
*  The back was the smoking section where the toilet was. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5877.34s)]
*  So you'd smell shit and cigarettes the entire flight. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5880.14s)]
*  Yeah, no, that thing didn't work. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5883.74s)]
*  I mean, maybe the ventilation systems [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5886.099999999999s)]
*  weren't as good back then, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5887.9s)]
*  but there was smoke everywhere back there. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5888.9s)]
*  So you can get a photo of the smoking section [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5891.22s)]
*  on an airplane in like the 1980s. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5893.62s)]
*  I remember I was playing a club called Riddles in Chicago, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5896.179999999999s)]
*  just outside, it's like, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5898.9s)]
*  I forget what the city outside Chicago, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5900.7s)]
*  but it was one of the last places [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5902.46s)]
*  that you could still smoke inside [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5904.42s)]
*  and the stage was so high. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5906.0199999999995s)]
*  So you would literally be like in the smoke. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5907.78s)]
*  So here's people smoking on an airplane. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5911.139999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy, dude. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5913.14s)]
*  Like when they always announce this is a non-smoking flight, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5915.22s)]
*  like where are the smoking flights? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5917.780000000001s)]
*  I remember we'd get in planes even in the 90s [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5919.54s)]
*  and there were still ashtrays in them. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5921.900000000001s)]
*  Is that Alex Jones in the crowd? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5924.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5925.660000000001s)]
*  Time traveler, I'm a fucking time traveler. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5926.660000000001s)]
*  That's Alex Jones' dad. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5929.860000000001s)]
*  Look at all these people smoking, crazy. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5931.3s)]
*  Smoking section of a plane. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5933.58s)]
*  It looks fairly smoke free. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5935.700000000001s)]
*  They probably had some ventilation back then. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5937.22s)]
*  So this is 84 in Miami. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5939.1s)]
*  Is this when they were, this guy's smoking [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5941.26s)]
*  and they're interviewing him on the plane. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5943.1s)]
*  Is this when they were trying to ban it? [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5944.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, probably. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5946.5s)]
*  This looks like a conversation. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5947.38s)]
*  They seem to be asking people about what they think. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5948.820000000001s)]
*  When did they ban it? [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5950.3s)]
*  When did they ban in-flight smoking? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5956.42s)]
*  Let's take a guess. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5962.820000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna say 94. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5963.860000000001s)]
*  What do you say? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5966.7s)]
*  I think it's way before that. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5967.54s)]
*  87. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5969.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so seven years. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5970.58s)]
*  Congressional action in 1987 led to a ban [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5972.179999999999s)]
*  on in-flight smoking in 88 airlines based in United States [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5975.0599999999995s)]
*  banned smoking on domestic flights of less than two hours. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5978.179999999999s)]
*  So more than two hours you could smoke, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5981.98s)]
*  which was extended to domestic flights [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5983.82s)]
*  of less than six hours in 1990 [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5985.5s)]
*  and to all domestic and international flights in 2000. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5988.099999999999s)]
*  International flights, 2000. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5992.74s)]
*  Pilots were allowed to continue smoking after the 1990 ban [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5994.74s)]
*  due to concerns over potential flight safety issues [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=5998.7s)]
*  caused by nicotine withdrawal and chronic smokers. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6001.0599999999995s)]
*  Yo, due to prohibition of smoking. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6004.98s)]
*  Whatever they need to do to land the plane. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6008.22s)]
*  Yeah, give them a fucking patch. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6010.0599999999995s)]
*  The US Federal Aviation Administration regulations [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6012.38s)]
*  mandate that functioning ashtrays be conspicuously located [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6014.82s)]
*  on the doors of all airplane bathrooms. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6017.9s)]
*  This is because there must be a safe place [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6020.42s)]
*  to dispose of a lit cigarette [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6022.7s)]
*  if someone violates the no smoking rule. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6024.0599999999995s)]
*  That's why they're there. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6026.34s)]
*  1990 Air Canada adopted non-smoking policy [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6027.82s)]
*  on all of its routes. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6031.259999999999s)]
*  In 94, Canada was the first country to ban smoking [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6032.179999999999s)]
*  on all flights operated by Canadian carriers, [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6034.62s)]
*  which also covered charter flights, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6037.58s)]
*  but not foreign airlines flying to Canada. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6039.759999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6043.179999999999s)]
*  So basically 2000s and they wrapped it all up. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6045.98s)]
*  Which I'm happy about. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6049.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6051.099999999999s)]
*  You can still smoke in restaurants then. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6051.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6053.3s)]
*  I remember the Addison improv. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6054.139999999999s)]
*  Used to still have smoking and we'd come from LA. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6057.02s)]
*  And in the early days, the comic store, they had smoking. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6059.540000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6062.860000000001s)]
*  In the 90s, you could smoke indoors. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6063.700000000001s)]
*  And I remember Drew Carey of all people. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6065.22s)]
*  Barney's Beannery, they put a ban on smoking [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6068.580000000001s)]
*  and all restaurants and bars in Los Angeles. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6072.06s)]
*  And Drew Carey was protesting it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6075.34s)]
*  And the idea was that- That's nuts. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6078.14s)]
*  I know, it's crazy. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6079.700000000001s)]
*  He was one of the people, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6080.700000000001s)]
*  the idea was that like you're gonna kill the business [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6081.900000000001s)]
*  and you're gonna also, freedom. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6084.1s)]
*  Like people know that you can smoke there. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6087.46s)]
*  If you don't wanna go to a place that's smoky, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6088.3s)]
*  don't go there. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6090.099999999999s)]
*  But the thing you have to think about is- [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6091.259999999999s)]
*  But now you can smoke weed indoors. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6092.94s)]
*  1998, Reason, Smoke In with Drew Carey. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6094.38s)]

*  about all this. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6102.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6109.74s)]
*  All the libertarians show up. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6110.58s)]
*  But it's all, they were like, hey, we've always smoked. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6111.86s)]
*  Don't take away our freedom. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6114.259999999999s)]
*  But the thing you have to take in consideration [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6115.52s)]
*  is waitresses and bartenders. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6117.14s)]
*  Those people die from lung cancer [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6119.280000000001s)]
*  because of secondhand smoke. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6121.56s)]
*  Cause secondhand, if you're only breathing in smoke, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6122.88s)]
*  the whole place is smoke. All the time. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6125.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6126.8s)]
*  Do you remember that gig we did in Toronto? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6127.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6129.4400000000005s)]
*  The weed gig. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6130.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I call it Gorilla In The Mist [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6131.120000000001s)]
*  because you couldn't see anybody in the crowd. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6133.160000000001s)]
*  Did you see images, like just black figures moving, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6136.6s)]
*  dark shady figures moving in this. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6139.92s)]
*  The entire room was filled with weed smoke [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6141.64s)]
*  to the point where you literally could barely see. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6145.02s)]
*  Like you weren't breathing air. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6148.56s)]
*  You were breathing weed smoke. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6149.860000000001s)]
*  You were contact high the minute your foot hit the stage. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6150.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6154.06s)]
*  You were bonkers. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6154.88s)]
*  Guys who didn't smoke pot would go there. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6155.72s)]
*  I don't think you were smoking pot at the time. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6157.26s)]
*  No, no. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6158.42s)]
*  Guys who didn't smoke pot would go there [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6159.26s)]
*  and be obliterated. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6160.660000000001s)]
*  Like by the time they did their set, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6162.42s)]
*  they couldn't remember their jokes. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6163.860000000001s)]
*  They were confused and anxious and fucking scared. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6165.1s)]
*  Toronto's got a great comedy scene right now. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6168.18s)]
*  I just did a gig up there and those, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6170.46s)]
*  it reminded me a lot of your club. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6172.26s)]
*  Dude, those kids don't care, bro. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6174.42s)]
*  They'll say everything to anybody all the time. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6176.5s)]
*  I'm like, how is this possible? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6179.62s)]
*  Well, I think Canada is experiencing a lot of people [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6181.46s)]
*  that are rebelling against the tyrannical government. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6186.06s)]
*  The government is so bad now. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6189.58s)]
*  In Canada, you can't post links to stories. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6191.34s)]
*  So they did it in a very sneaky way, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6195.4800000000005s)]
*  saying that these social media companies have to compensate [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6198.92s)]
*  the media outlets that have the thing. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6202.0199999999995s)]
*  But the thing is it's like a lot of them are just links. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6204.62s)]
*  You can't even post a link to a story in the New York Times. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6207.299999999999s)]
*  How is anybody okay with that? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6210.9s)]
*  How are people in the far, far left, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6212.179999999999s)]
*  the progressive left, which is like the last, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6215.78s)]
*  I'd say like 10% of the population, right? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6218.299999999999s)]
*  How are they okay with information being censored? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6221.62s)]
*  Why would you even, no matter what your stance is, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6226.7s)]
*  I think you want the data. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6229.219999999999s)]
*  They did it in a sneaky way, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6230.86s)]
*  saying that this is financially unfair [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6231.86s)]
*  to these media corporations who are suffering. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6235.24s)]
*  I mean, that is true. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6237.62s)]
*  There's a reason why they have to make [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6239.0599999999995s)]
*  these horrible clickbait ads, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6240.219999999999s)]
*  and the reason why editors put clickbait stories [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6242.42s)]
*  and headlines is because they just need people [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6244.94s)]
*  to click on the links. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6247.08s)]
*  They're fucking starving. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6247.92s)]
*  They're all going under. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6248.74s)]
*  The LA Times just fired a bunch of people. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6249.58s)]
*  Newspapers are barely hanging in. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6252.66s)]
*  So my question to you is you don't think it has anything [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6254.82s)]
*  to do with censoring information? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6257.42s)]
*  No, no, no, it does, for sure. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6259.46s)]
*  This was my point. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6261.34s)]
*  My point was the premise of it seemed reasonable. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6262.46s)]
*  More people need to go to Canada Times, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6266.22s)]
*  wherever the fuck it is, to get their information. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6268.900000000001s)]
*  They shouldn't be going to Twitter or Facebook. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6271.34s)]
*  And so to make people go to these websites [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6274.58s)]
*  to get their news, we're gonna stop all of the ability [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6277.900000000001s)]
*  to take these things and post them. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6283.1s)]
*  But what you're really doing is you're stopping awareness. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6285.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6287.820000000001s)]
*  Because people aren't gonna be able to filter out all, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6288.66s)]
*  you, like back in the day when we just read newspapers, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6290.58s)]
*  you had to be a fucking real nut [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6294.099999999999s)]
*  to get into the Kennedy assassination. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6297.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6299.099999999999s)]
*  You had to be a real nut. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6299.94s)]
*  You had to be reading books. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6300.76s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6301.94s)]
*  You had to really get into it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6302.78s)]
*  You had to be meeting in basements [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6303.599999999999s)]
*  to have conversations. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6304.66s)]
*  Somebody had to tell you about it, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6305.5s)]
*  and you went and got the book. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6306.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6308.26s)]
*  And you didn't get anything from the internet. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6309.099999999999s)]
*  There was nothing, there was no internet. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6311.08s)]
*  So it didn't exist. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6312.46s)]
*  So you would have to get a physical newspaper to read it, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6313.3s)]
*  and most people only read the stuff in the beginning [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6315.74s)]
*  on the sports page. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6318.1s)]
*  So you read the first couple of pages, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6319.22s)]
*  see if you're gonna die. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6320.780000000001s)]
*  Are we gonna die? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6321.8s)]
*  What's going on in Saudi Arabia? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6322.64s)]
*  What's going on in Yemen? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6323.700000000001s)]
*  And then once you get past that, you get to the sports, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6324.9400000000005s)]
*  and you read the comics or whatever. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6327.26s)]
*  And that was why we were so uninformed. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6328.900000000001s)]
*  We were grossly uninformed because most people- [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6332.4400000000005s)]
*  We were naive. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6334.9400000000005s)]
*  Right, very. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6335.900000000001s)]
*  And now, most of the news I get is from links. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6337.18s)]
*  Most of the news I get is you'll send me a link, [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6342.820000000001s)]
*  someone else, Alex Jones will send me something, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6345.54s)]
*  someone else will send me something. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6347.2s)]
*  Michael Malice will send me something. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6348.88s)]
*  I get stuff from Dave Smith. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6350.12s)]
*  I get stuff- Great resources. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6352.2s)]
*  I get stuff from people sending me something, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6353.76s)]
*  and then I go to Twitter and I find things [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6355.48s)]
*  and I send it to them. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6357.5599999999995s)]
*  Twitter's great. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6358.4s)]
*  And we all send each other stuff. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6359.24s)]
*  And this has greatly increased people's awareness [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6360.36s)]
*  of things like this. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6363.4s)]
*  This fucking martial law bill that they passed through, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6365.139999999999s)]
*  who fucking would have known about that? [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6368.599999999999s)]
*  Who would have known that the government made a decision [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6370.36s)]
*  to make lethal force from the military [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6372.78s)]
*  something they can use on citizens that are protesting? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6375.66s)]
*  There's a long story about how this has maybe [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6378.14s)]
*  been misinterpreted over the last few weeks online. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6381.18s)]
*  This is a report from Bio. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6384.18s)]
*  This is the martial law thing? [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6385.98s)]
*  It's been a thing, I guess, originally since 2007. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6388.5s)]
*  It was taken down offline for a while, then reposted, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6391.42s)]
*  and that's why they're saying that. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6394.46s)]
*  This is, they call it a data void. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6395.86s)]
*  Well, it says a reissued Department of Defense directive [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6397.58s)]
*  that documents procedures around when there is [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6400.98s)]
*  potential use of lethal force against Americans. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6404.38s)]
*  Subset of these rumors allege the directive [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6406.78s)]
*  to be suspiciously timed with the coming election. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6408.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, kinda. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6411.54s)]
*  Myriad and evolving rumors rely upon speculation [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6413.54s)]
*  about the motivations behind the changes to the DOD directive [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6418.18s)]
*  and perceive differences between this new document [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6421.62s)]
*  and existing documents. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6424.78s)]
*  This sounds a little bit like they're trying [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6426.5s)]
*  to minimize this. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6429.62s)]
*  Of course. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6430.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, they go through the time mark [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6431.82s)]
*  when this is exactly what I was trying to say. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6432.78s)]
*  Right, but the bottom line is, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6434.26s)]
*  this is for the first time in history [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6436.46s)]
*  where they have pushed this directive, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6439.94s)]
*  and it is happening during an election, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6441.94s)]
*  and it is a thing where they're now saying [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6444.94s)]
*  you can use lethal force on protesters. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6447.82s)]
*  So all these things, you're trying to gaslight people [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6450.0599999999995s)]
*  into thinking this is not a big deal. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6452.7s)]
*  This is a gigantic deal. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6454.26s)]
*  This is a huge deal, and this kinda fits into [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6456.18s)]
*  my whole belief about what the alleged kidnapping [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6459.42s)]
*  of the Michigan governor, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6463.42s)]
*  which turned out to be a bunch of just- [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6465.54s)]
*  FBI informants. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6467.9400000000005s)]
*  I saw the funniest meme, and Ari was like, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6468.78s)]
*  what is this meme? The Spider-Man one? [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6471.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, fat, fat, fat, some autistic fuck, right? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6472.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6476.22s)]
*  It was so funny. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6477.06s)]
*  And then you get into, so they took that guy [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6478.3s)]
*  who's running that FBI program [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6480.46s)]
*  and moved him over to January 6th, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6483.74s)]
*  and he was in charge of that. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6485.86s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6487.22s)]
*  So it's like, I personally believe you. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6488.06s)]
*  You go, Sam, what do you think that's all about? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6489.900000000001s)]
*  I think those two events were to try to drum up support [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6491.740000000001s)]
*  for the Homeland Security opening up [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6495.06s)]
*  a department of domestic terrorism [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6498.54s)]
*  in which they can label a US citizen a domestic terrorist, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6501.06s)]
*  which means all your civil rights go away. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6505.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6507.580000000001s)]
*  And that's a big movement right now within the government [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6508.42s)]
*  to be able to take away your civil rights. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6511.580000000001s)]
*  Which, if there are domestic terrorists, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6513.9800000000005s)]
*  we should have a movement to stop domestic terrorism. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6516.26s)]
*  But when you have agent provocateurs [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6518.54s)]
*  who infiltrate these organizations [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6520.9400000000005s)]
*  and then turn them into terrorist organizations [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6523.46s)]
*  so that they can go in [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6525.820000000001s)]
*  and shut these protest organizations down, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6527.14s)]
*  that's when things get dirty. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6529.900000000001s)]
*  And that seems like that's what happened [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6531.18s)]
*  during January 6th. Or even pushing the, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6533.02s)]
*  whatever event they want to happen, kind of convince, [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6536.18s)]
*  hey guys, maybe we should go try and do this. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6538.860000000001s)]
*  Yes. This governor's causing some crazy. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6541.5s)]
*  12 out of the 14 people. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6543.900000000001s)]

*  And then there's that kid who the 19 year old kid [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6551.46s)]
*  who they talked into detonating that fake bomb. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6554.0599999999995s)]
*  You know that kid? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6556.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6557.26s)]
*  I believe that was in Dallas. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6558.099999999999s)]
*  So they take this young, stupid kid [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6559.38s)]
*  and they fucking radicalize him. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6561.66s)]
*  And then they give him a cell phone and tell him, [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6564.26s)]
*  press these buttons and that bomb will go off. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6567.099999999999s)]
*  They give him the fake bomb. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6568.94s)]

*  either Utah or New Mexico, where they found that compound? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6579.34s)]
*  And then they were like, they basically discovered that [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6582.98s)]
*  according to the guy running the compound, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6586.54s)]

*  No. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6591.74s)]

*  that they were training school shooters here. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6599.26s)]
*  What was this? How long ago was this? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6601.7s)]
*  This was like a couple of years ago, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6603.34s)]
*  like three or four years ago. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6604.78s)]
*  So this place was trained, [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6606.34s)]
*  New Mexico compound suspects were training children [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6608.54s)]

*  What? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6617.7s)]
*  And then they just dismissed the case [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=6618.54s)]

*  Holy fuck, man. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7040.0s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7042.36s)]
*  Right? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7043.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7045.0s)]
*  And it's so crazy to me, like just hearing that, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7045.84s)]
*  is like if you actually study FDR, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7048.44s)]
*  like he very much was a Wall Street puppet. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7050.76s)]
*  Like he very much was in there doing their bidding [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7053.8s)]
*  and he had a lot, like all this crazy stuff [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7057.48s)]
*  with Pearl Harbor, connections to Hitler, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7060.42s)]
*  all this crazy stuff that people never hear about. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7063.06s)]
*  And it's super interesting to me [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7066.22s)]
*  that when he's seen as a puppet of Wall Street, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7068.78s)]
*  they're also trying to take him out. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7072.1s)]
*  And also, if you think back then, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7074.06s)]
*  there was no access to information. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7076.46s)]
*  So they could do all this stuff, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7080.38s)]
*  like the assassination of Kennedy, [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7082.02s)]
*  they could do all this stuff and completely cover it up. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7084.14s)]
*  There was no one had a chance, no one had a chance. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7087.3s)]
*  And anybody who opened their mouth was dead. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7091.02s)]
*  Anybody that opened their mouth [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7092.42s)]
*  wound up dying in suspicious circumstances. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7093.66s)]
*  Yeah, so I just did an episode with a guy, [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7095.740000000001s)]
*  he's called the Dark Journalist, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7098.06s)]
*  that's the way he goes by, and he mind blown. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7100.22s)]
*  He was telling me like, yeah, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7103.22s)]
*  all the people that you think were involved [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7104.7s)]
*  in the assassination of JFK, they were involved. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7107.18s)]
*  The intelligence agency, multiple intelligence agencies, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7111.1s)]
*  the Federal Reserve, a bunch of people. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7115.1s)]
*  One of the groups that I never heard of [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7120.74s)]
*  was basically the space program. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7124.3s)]
*  The people who ran the space program of that time [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7129.74s)]
*  were involved in it because Kennedy wanted to share [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7132.9400000000005s)]
*  all the information they had on UFOs and technologies [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7137.22s)]
*  with the Russians because he didn't want the Russians [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7141.66s)]
*  to think if they saw something weird in the sky, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7144.98s)]
*  it was the US and some kind of weird nuclear weapon. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7147.0599999999995s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7151.78s)]
*  So, and you think about back then, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7152.62s)]
*  who was involved in the space station, say with me, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7154.3s)]
*  Nazis who were brought over, you know, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7156.94s)]
*  we discussed last time on the show. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7159.66s)]
*  Operation Paperclip. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7160.9s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the Nazis lost. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7161.9s)]
*  I think they just crip walked over here [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7163.9s)]
*  and set up shop. Well, they definitely lost, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7165.58s)]
*  but we took all the good ones [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7167.0199999999995s)]
*  that were engineers and scientists, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7168.22s)]
*  and Russia took the other ones. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7170.34s)]
*  The only pushback I have on that, dude, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7172.46s)]
*  is that if you're like, if it's some kind of thing [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7174.0199999999995s)]
*  where we're sneaking them over, they're bringing them over, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7176.38s)]
*  like nobody changes their names, like everybody. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7179.66s)]
*  Well, they didn't have to sneak them over. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7181.98s)]
*  They were brought under the protection [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7183.78s)]
*  of the United States government, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7185.54s)]
*  and no one could know if they were Nazis. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7186.66s)]
*  There was no information. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7189.38s)]
*  Yeah, but Von Braun had his name, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7190.66s)]
*  and he was like on trial. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7192.22s)]
*  Everyone's like, we got this Nazi over here. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7193.66s)]
*  The Simon Wiesenthal Center said [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7196.94s)]
*  that if Von Braun was alive today, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7199.82s)]
*  they would charge him with crimes against humanity. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7202.22s)]
*  They hung the five slowest Jews [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7203.62s)]
*  in their rocket factory in Berlin [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7205.86s)]
*  to motivate people to work harder. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7207.46s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7209.42s)]
*  So they were all Nazis. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7210.26s)]
*  So if you think about the Nazis hated the Russians, [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7212.02s)]
*  and he wanted to share all this information [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7216.42s)]
*  with the Russians, and they did not like that at all. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7218.86s)]
*  And here's the craziest thing. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7222.5s)]
*  I was like, oh, what do I want to tell Joe? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7224.02s)]
*  Here's the craziest thing. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7225.62s)]
*  I've had people on my show talking about this. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7226.78s)]
*  Like there is a belief out there [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7230.1s)]
*  that the head of the power pyramid [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7232.9400000000005s)]
*  of intelligence agencies is NASA. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7237.660000000001s)]
*  Because if you think about this, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7241.9400000000005s)]
*  it's the one thing that everybody wants to work together on. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7244.06s)]
*  Like we're possibly in some, [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7248.740000000001s)]
*  we're having this weird kind of nuclear standoff [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7250.820000000001s)]
*  with Russians, but somehow, some way, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7253.14s)]
*  we're all working on a space station together. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7255.740000000001s)]
*  That and anarchy are the two things [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7257.98s)]
*  where everyone puts their differences aside. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7260.099999999999s)]
*  We're like, let's all work together. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7262.219999999999s)]
*  And it's like, there is this real belief [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7264.0599999999995s)]
*  that the head of the snake of the intelligence agencies, [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7266.099999999999s)]
*  which is like, Mossad, CIA, MI6, is NASA space station. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7269.419999999999s)]
*  Is the NASA organization. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7276.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7278.82s)]
*  The thing that would make that plausible [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7279.66s)]
*  is if the knowledge of alien life is absolute. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7282.78s)]
*  Absolute, real, and they have to protect [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7287.82s)]
*  that information from getting out. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7290.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7292.38s)]

*  What DARPA has is 40, 50 years in the future. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7378.18s)]
*  Well, we can see what they're working on. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7381.54s)]
*  So the thing about DARPA is DARPA, [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7383.54s)]
*  like Boston Dynamics, [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7386.18s)]
*  Boston Dynamics is a publicly traded company. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7387.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7389.58s)]
*  And they, is it? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7390.42s)]
*  I think it is. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7391.5s)]
*  But the thing is they show all their innovations [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7393.3s)]
*  and they show all the new stuff they're working on. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7395.9800000000005s)]
*  But the stuff that they're working on [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7398.46s)]
*  keeps getting better and better and better [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7400.34s)]
*  to the point where like, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7402.54s)]
*  when are they gonna stop showing us? [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7403.38s)]
*  I think they have robots that do like those ninja courses now. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7405.62s)]
*  Have you seen those? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7409.099999999999s)]
*  They do back flips. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7409.94s)]
*  They can run like cheetahs. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7410.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the slow rollout. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7412.34s)]
*  So we get used to it. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7414.26s)]
*  I think what DARPA has, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7415.099999999999s)]
*  the real stuff is way beyond that. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7417.42s)]
*  And they slow roll it out to us over time. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7420.0599999999995s)]
*  I'd believe that. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7423.0199999999995s)]
*  Their stuff is, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7424.22s)]
*  that's what I believe most of the UFO stuff is. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7425.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, 100. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7427.26s)]
*  Like, you know, you look at Area 51, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7428.099999999999s)]
*  they're like, oh, look at this. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7429.98s)]
*  It's this crazy base. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7430.98s)]
*  That's not even the base. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7432.099999999999s)]
*  That is the smoke screen. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7433.66s)]
*  Well, Area S4. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7435.3s)]
*  Is that Big Mountain? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7436.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's where Bob Lazar claims he was working [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7437.86s)]
*  on back engineering the flying saucers. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7440.62s)]
*  I just heard the craziest thing about Bob Lazar. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7442.82s)]
*  What'd you hear? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7444.98s)]
*  Like he got busted running a hooker, fucking. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7445.82s)]
*  A brothel? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7448.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7449.12s)]
*  I think he did. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7449.96s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7450.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's a wild boy living in Vegas. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7451.62s)]
*  He's a wild boy. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7453.26s)]
*  Well, also, this is a guy that put a jet engine [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7454.14s)]
*  in the back of his Honda. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7456.38s)]
*  You know, he was kind of a crazy person before. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7457.58s)]
*  I mean, he was a young man. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7460.0599999999995s)]
*  That's why they brought him over, allegedly, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7461.22s)]
*  to Area S4 in the first place. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7463.900000000001s)]
*  Because like, the way science is supposed to work [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7465.740000000001s)]
*  is you get a bunch of people and they collaborate [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7469.22s)]
*  on something and you write papers [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7471.02s)]
*  so that other scientists can review it [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7473.22s)]
*  and find out if it's correct. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7475.1s)]
*  The way they were doing it, [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7476.66s)]
*  everything was compartmentalized [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7477.780000000001s)]
*  because it was so top secret. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7479.320000000001s)]
*  They couldn't let other scientists work on it. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7480.46s)]
*  And so because of that, they weren't making any progress. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7484.46s)]
*  So what they would have to do is bring in [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7486.820000000001s)]
*  completely new scientists every few years. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7488.38s)]
*  With new eyes and go, what do you think of this? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7491.62s)]
*  And they didn't even tell them what it is. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7493.94s)]
*  Well, Lazar said, I had dinner with Lazar. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7495.86s)]
*  He's very compelling. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7498.299999999999s)]
*  Me and Andrew Schultz had dinner with Lazar [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7499.42s)]
*  and Jeremy Corbell. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7502.36s)]
*  And Lazar is very compelling. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7503.62s)]
*  And what he essentially was saying was that [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7507.0599999999995s)]
*  when he got there, they showed him this thing [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7509.38s)]
*  and it had an American flag sticker on it. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7511.98s)]
*  And he was like, oh, that makes sense. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7514.0599999999995s)]
*  It's ours. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7515.82s)]
*  So this thing that people keep seeing is one of ours. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7516.66s)]
*  And then as he starts examining this thing, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7519.62s)]
*  he realizes this doesn't have any seams. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7521.42s)]
*  This thing is 3D printed of some unknown alloy. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7524.46s)]
*  There's no controls inside of it. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7528.18s)]
*  It's designed for something that's three feet tall. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7530.0599999999995s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7533.14s)]
*  And then there's some reactor in there [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7534.38s)]
*  that has an element that's a completely theoretical element [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7536.84s)]
*  in a stable form that they're bombarding with radiation [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7540.0599999999995s)]
*  that manipulates gravity. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7543.3s)]
*  And so they're telling him, tell us how this works. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7545.54s)]
*  And it's like, what? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7550.18s)]
*  So what's that called when you go back? [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7551.58s)]
*  Back engineering. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7553.42s)]
*  Back engineering, yeah. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7554.26s)]
*  Yeah, so that was where this job was, back engineering it. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7555.38s)]
*  But when he was doing this, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7557.98s)]
*  he was on a completely top secret level of information [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7559.9s)]
*  to the point where when you're at that level, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7565.18s)]
*  they have to monitor everything. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7567.42s)]
*  They bug your house, they monitor your phone, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7568.66s)]
*  calls, everything. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7570.74s)]
*  So he couldn't even tell his wife what he was doing. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7571.7s)]
*  So the way it works is they fly you out of Vegas. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7574.12s)]
*  So they give you a call, 11 p.m., go to Vegas. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7577.1s)]
*  Go to the airport, you gotta go. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7580.22s)]
*  So he tells his wife, I gotta go to work. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7581.860000000001s)]
*  She's like, what? [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7583.26s)]
*  You have to go to work at 11 o'clock at night? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7584.14s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7585.620000000001s)]
*  He's like, I gotta go to work. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7586.4400000000005s)]
*  And so she was like, fuck this dude. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7587.280000000001s)]
*  He's cheating on me, I'm gonna cheat. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7588.9400000000005s)]
*  So she starts banging her flight instructor. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7590.5s)]
*  She's taking flight lessons. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7593.02s)]
*  She starts banging this guy. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7594.38s)]
*  And so because Lazar would be [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7596.34s)]
*  in emotionally unstable position [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7598.46s)]
*  if his wife is having an affair, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7599.820000000001s)]
*  he loses his top secret clearance [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7601.18s)]
*  and they have to relieve him. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7602.900000000001s)]
*  He can't work there anymore. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7603.820000000001s)]
*  So then he starts, he's telling his friends now. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7605.18s)]
*  He's like, you can't believe what I've been working on. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7607.700000000001s)]
*  I wanna show you. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7610.22s)]
*  And every Wednesday, they had this area [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7611.34s)]
*  where you can go to, this plateau, [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7613.860000000001s)]
*  and you could look out at area S4 [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7615.58s)]
*  and you could see in the sky them piloting these crafts. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7618.3s)]
*  So he goes there with his friends on multiple occasions [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7621.860000000001s)]
*  and gets arrested. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7624.3s)]
*  And once he gets arrested, then he realizes, [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7625.58s)]
*  oh my, they might fucking kill me. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7628.34s)]
*  I'm gonna come clean and I'm gonna tell my story. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7630.58s)]
*  So then he contacts George Knapp, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7633.24s)]
*  who was an investigative journalist of Las Vegas. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7635.16s)]
*  And the first ones that he does, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7638.32s)]
*  the first interview he does, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7640.12s)]
*  he's got his face blacked out. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7641.08s)]
*  You can't see him. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7642.5599999999995s)]
*  And then he's like, you know what? [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7643.76s)]
*  To save my life, I probably should be full public with this. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7645.2s)]
*  It might be the only way. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7648.639999999999s)]
*  They don't fucking kill me. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7649.88s)]
*  So they were threatening him [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7651.36s)]
*  and very mysterious, breaking into his house, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7652.639999999999s)]
*  very creepy, mysterious shit. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7655.16s)]
*  So then he tells the whole story. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7658.32s)]
*  Hasn't varied from that story at all [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7659.5199999999995s)]
*  in more than 30 years. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7662.26s)]
*  What do you think of disclosure? [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7664.1s)]
*  Do you think there's some bad agents in it? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7665.62s)]
*  I think, and I think there's sometimes [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7668.780000000001s)]
*  when people come in and talk to me about it. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7671.1s)]
*  I think they probably use people like me [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7672.66s)]
*  as a mouthpiece to spread bullshit. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7677.06s)]
*  Bill Cooper thought that. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7679.7s)]
*  He thought that they gave him documents [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7680.860000000001s)]
*  so he would go out and tell people. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7682.58s)]
*  Yeah, I bet they do. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7684.3s)]
*  That's the best way to hide something. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7686.14s)]
*  The way you hide something is you connect it [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7688.24s)]
*  with a bunch of stupid shit. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7689.92s)]
*  You connect it to Bigfoot. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7691.58s)]
*  You connect it to Skinwalker Ranch. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7692.9400000000005s)]
*  You make it seem kooky. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7695.38s)]
*  And then people just dismiss it. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7697.66s)]
*  They dismiss all of it. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7699.3s)]
*  And I think that's the best way to hide a drone program. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7700.38s)]
*  Best way to hide a drone program is say, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7702.9s)]
*  we are in possession of things that are not of this world. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7705.46s)]
*  Like, wow, really? [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7708.42s)]
*  Yes, and there's these top secret organizations [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7709.34s)]
*  and they wanna stay top secret. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7712.02s)]
*  But as you notice with all this disclosure, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7713.58s)]
*  nothing really gets out. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7716.5s)]
*  It's just talk. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7718.7s)]
*  And so this is what gives me, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7720.58s)]
*  all my spidey senses go off. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7723.0599999999995s)]
*  I've smelled bullshit. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7725.46s)]
*  Nothing's really happening. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7726.62s)]
*  Right, right, nothing's happening. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7727.94s)]
*  And Jeremy Corbell's convinced [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7729.26s)]
*  that new disclosures are right around the corner [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7730.62s)]
*  because he's balls deep in his stuff. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7732.26s)]
*  I'm like, okay, maybe, maybe, but I'm not seeing anything. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7733.9s)]
*  What I'm seeing is a bunch of people [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7736.86s)]
*  talking about these things. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7737.82s)]
*  And that doesn't mean anything to me. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7739.26s)]
*  They're interesting. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7740.98s)]
*  I'll keep having them come on. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7741.9s)]
*  I'll keep talking to people. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7743.34s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7744.46s)]
*  Do you think they give people information [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7745.34s)]
*  hoping they'll put it out? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7747.22s)]
*  100%. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7748.34s)]
*  I think there's also people [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7749.38s)]
*  that are still in the government [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7750.42s)]
*  that say they're whistleblowers [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7751.62s)]
*  and they go out and they spread false information. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7752.78s)]
*  I have a friend of mine, his name Trevor. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7755.900000000001s)]
*  He told this story on my show [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7757.900000000001s)]
*  about his dad worked at this institute in Chicago. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7760.1s)]
*  And his dad was just like a handyman at the place. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7765.38s)]
*  He'd fix stuff, right? [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7768.46s)]
*  And well, one day he gets a call to a level [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7769.54s)]
*  that he's never been before. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7771.38s)]
*  And he goes, okay, I'm going down. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7773.18s)]
*  So he goes all the way down. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7774.74s)]
*  And he gets in it. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7776.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like a weird, weird, like just a weird floor. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7776.86s)]
*  It's like weird energy. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7780.66s)]
*  He starts walking down the hall. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7781.9s)]
*  He looks in, there's like animal experiments going on. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7783.5s)]
*  His dad tells him this. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7786.5s)]
*  And his dad tells him this way later on. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7787.7s)]
*  Like he doesn't have much time left in his life [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7789.78s)]
*  at this point. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7792.379999999999s)]
*  So he tells him this story. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7793.419999999999s)]
*  And he says he sees some weird stuff [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7794.74s)]
*  with like monkeys going on, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7798.0599999999995s)]
*  a weird thing with a horse in this thing. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7799.7s)]
*  So he keeps walking. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7802.259999999999s)]
*  He's like, what is going on here? [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7803.099999999999s)]
*  And he goes far enough, right? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7804.14s)]
*  And he sees this, there's just this room [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7806.42s)]
*  with this giant craft. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7808.54s)]
*  And he's like in awe of this craft. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7811.02s)]
*  And he, Trevor's dad tells him, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7813.18s)]
*  I see something in there and it's like gray. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7815.9800000000005s)]
*  I don't know what it is. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7818.02s)]
*  And then all of a sudden this tiny green thing [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7819.3s)]
*  is like walking on the outside of this craft. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7821.22s)]
*  And he goes, what the fuck is that? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7825.22s)]
*  Suddenly bang, guns are on him. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7826.860000000001s)]
*  It's security. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7828.660000000001s)]
*  What are you doing here? [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7829.5s)]
*  He's like, I just work here. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7830.320000000001s)]
*  I was sent down here to just fix something. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7831.42s)]
*  They're like, get out of here. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7834.18s)]
*  And they're like, what are we gonna do with him? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7835.02s)]
*  So he says that he has to agree [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7836.38s)]
*  never to tell anybody anything, right? [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7838.66s)]
*  But as his dad, his dad tells Trevor, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7840.58s)]
*  every time he travels, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7843.54s)]
*  he'll go to a random country somewhere, [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7844.9800000000005s)]
*  he'll get pulled in security. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7847.18s)]
*  He gets put in a room and these men in black come out [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7848.62s)]
*  and sit down and go, did you tell anybody? [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7852.3s)]
*  Did you tell anybody? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7854.66s)]
*  And he's like, I haven't told anybody anything. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7855.74s)]
*  And this would happen to him multiple times. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7857.46s)]
*  And Trevor said his dad's not that creative, [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7860.14s)]
*  never would come up with crazy stuff like this, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7862.14s)]
*  told him towards the end of his life [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7865.38s)]
*  when it was coming to an end. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7866.820000000001s)]
*  So my question is, do they have him come down [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7868.200000000001s)]
*  hoping that he'll start talking about this with people? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7871.5s)]
*  Because part of this- [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7875.46s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7876.3s)]
*  If it's real, it's probably incompetence. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7877.42s)]
*  Probably some incompetent person [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7879.18s)]
*  told them to go down there. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7880.58s)]
*  Some arrogant, incompetent person [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7881.740000000001s)]
*  that thought they had complete control over the scenario [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7884.22s)]
*  and they needed someone to go down there and do something. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7886.860000000001s)]
*  Just sent him down there. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7888.94s)]
*  So- [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7890.179999999999s)]
*  Maybe they trusted him. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7891.139999999999s)]
*  Maybe, but it's also like- [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7892.179999999999s)]
*  Because if he's working on anything top secret, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7893.78s)]
*  they're listening to all his phone calls. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7896.219999999999s)]
*  Well, he wasn't. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7898.0599999999995s)]
*  He was like a maintenance guy that worked upstairs. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7898.9s)]
*  Guarantee after that, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7902.299999999999s)]
*  they listen to all his phone calls. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7903.139999999999s)]
*  They knew where he was traveling. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7904.46s)]
*  They'd show up with these men in black. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7905.58s)]
*  Well, they probably listened to everything he did too, [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7907.219999999999s)]
*  just to make sure that he wasn't flapping his gums. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7908.86s)]
*  So this whole thing with the men in black too, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7912.379999999999s)]
*  there's this belief right now that maybe it's like, [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7914.9s)]
*  because you see videos of them walking through walls [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7918.5s)]
*  that they're just- [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7921.1s)]
*  What? [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7921.94s)]

*  It's possible. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7936.66s)]
*  Or it's like- [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7937.5s)]
*  Well, if you were gonna be an alien [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7939.22s)]
*  and you were gonna blend in with human beings, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7940.74s)]
*  dressing up in a suit would be the best way to do it. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7943.66s)]
*  Be a person in a suit, wear sunglasses [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7945.9s)]
*  so they don't see your eyes, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7947.82s)]
*  and just move around like a normal person. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7949.42s)]
*  If you can come here from another planet, [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7952.34s)]
*  you don't think you could disguise yourself [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7953.9s)]
*  as a different life form? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7955.82s)]
*  Possibly. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7957.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7957.9s)]
*  Do you think aliens are from other plants? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7958.74s)]
*  I think they might be angels and demons. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7960.38s)]
*  I'm not opposed to that idea. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7963.38s)]
*  I think there's probably, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7965.54s)]
*  well, there's definitely dimensions that we don't- [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7968.099999999999s)]
*  Like, Brian Cox was here yesterday, as I was saying, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7971.54s)]
*  and he was trying to explain to me quantum computing [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7974.179999999999s)]
*  and how quickly quantum computing works, [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7976.46s)]
*  like that a problem that would literally take [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7978.9s)]
*  the entire amount of time that the Earth has existed [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7982.26s)]
*  to solve by a regular computer can be solved in a second [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7986.02s)]
*  by a quantum computer. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7989.3s)]
*  And this quantum computer is literally somehow or another [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7990.42s)]
*  accessing other universes to come to its conclusion. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7994.46s)]
*  To do these calculations, [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=7999.02s)]
*  it's not only operating in this universe. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8000.58s)]
*  It's operating in other dimensions simultaneously [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8004.62s)]
*  and instantaneously. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8007.5s)]
*  The way he said it, it was like, [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8008.98s)]
*  and by the way, this is Brian Cox, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8010.22s)]
*  who's like a serious physicist. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8012.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8015.14s)]
*  He's a professor. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8015.98s)]
*  One of the smart ones. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8016.82s)]
*  He's a genius. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8017.64s)]
*  And he's literally explaining the mechanisms [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8018.48s)]
*  of quantum computing and explaining that quantum computing, [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8022.58s)]
*  even though they can't even figure out how to program it yet, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8025.94s)]
*  is already showing that wormholes are possible. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8028.0599999999995s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8031.42s)]
*  Wormholes are being used somehow [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8032.7s)]
*  in the quantum computing process. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8035.34s)]
*  Again, I'm sure I'm butchering this. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8036.9800000000005s)]
*  Brian, if you're listening, I'm sorry. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8038.78s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm butchering your words. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8040.5s)]
*  One of my favorite things to do on YouTube, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8041.34s)]
*  I go down weird rabbit holes. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8043.26s)]
*  I like to watch weird shit on YouTube. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8045.54s)]
*  I love watching black people get their hair cut. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8047.18s)]
*  I fucking love that shit. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8049.22s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8050.38s)]
*  It's just entertaining. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8051.38s)]
*  But one of my favorite things to do [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8052.7s)]
*  is watch long form math. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8054.38s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8057.8s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why, because it's, I'm like- [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8058.64s)]
*  So you watch it in alien language. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8060.7s)]
*  I watched this one video where it was 17 lines of math, [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8063.02s)]
*  and then I get to the conclusion, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8067.66s)]
*  and all I wrote was I've never done this in my real life, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8069.06s)]
*  ever in my life. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8071.58s)]
*  I've never had to use any of this stuff, [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8072.42s)]
*  because it's so smart. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8074.14s)]
*  And I love to just be like, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8076.1s)]
*  this isn't how I use it in real life. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8077.42s)]
*  All that is rudimentary in comparison [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8079.1s)]
*  to this quantum computing idea. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8080.9800000000005s)]
*  And what's fascinating about the quantum computing idea [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8082.5s)]
*  is that if there is this theory of many worlds, [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8085.38s)]
*  so if this theory is accurate, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8088.42s)]
*  then there are an infinite number of universes, would say, [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8090.2s)]
*  that it's entirely within the realm of possibility, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8094.599999999999s)]
*  if you think of that being a real thing, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8099.32s)]
*  that something can transport itself [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8101.38s)]
*  from those other dimensions to where we are. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8103.8s)]
*  So it might not be a metal craft that comes from Venus. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8107.34s)]
*  It might not be something so simple. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8110.9s)]
*  Like that's probably too simple for our little, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8112.84s)]
*  our stupid little minds might put it into that category. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8115.36s)]
*  And also that might be how they present themselves to us [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8118.92s)]
*  to make themselves seem at least tangible [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8123.12s)]
*  instead of what they really are, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8127.16s)]
*  which is probably outside of our ability to grasp. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8129.04s)]
*  Our understanding, our minds can't do that. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8132.4800000000005s)]
*  So whatever these things are, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8134.4400000000005s)]
*  I bet they're from multiple sources. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8136.04s)]
*  I bet there are actual physical things [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8138.12s)]
*  that come from somewhere. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8141.28s)]
*  But do they come from other planets? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8143.04s)]
*  Do they come from other dimensions? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8145.52s)]
*  Is it both? [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8147.32s)]
*  Are some of them interstellar travelers [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8148.84s)]
*  and some of them interdimensional travelers? [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8151.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8153.32s)]
*  I mean, I think we're basically ants. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8154.5199999999995s)]
*  We're these like very rudimentary things [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8157.04s)]
*  that as far as we know, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8159.36s)]
*  we're the most complex thing in the universe. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8160.28s)]
*  And I think if you scale that, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8162.34s)]
*  this is one of the things that Brian and I [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8164.5199999999995s)]
*  were talking about, [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8165.799999999999s)]
*  that if you take artificial intelligence [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8166.639999999999s)]
*  and quantum computing, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8168.48s)]
*  and you imagine a sentient life form [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8169.759999999999s)]
*  that relies on quantum computing instead of regular, [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8171.599999999999s)]
*  and it has access to like nuclear power plants to power it, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8173.639999999999s)]
*  you essentially create a God. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8178.16s)]
*  You get to the point where something is so powerful [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8179.0s)]
*  that it literally can control all the elements [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8181.24s)]
*  in the known universe, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8184.48s)]
*  and then have access to other universes. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8185.599999999999s)]
*  And that this might be what we're dealing with. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8188.76s)]
*  And we might be dealing with these beings [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8192.32s)]
*  that have always been here, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8194.16s)]
*  and they come and go, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8195.72s)]
*  and they observe, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8197.24s)]
*  or they intervene, [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8199.24s)]
*  or one of the things Lazar talked about, [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8200.52s)]
*  one of the most bizarre things he found, [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8202.88s)]
*  he said they had this very thick document [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8204.32s)]
*  that was all about religion, [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8207.72s)]
*  and that essentially what these life forms [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8209.48s)]
*  use us as is containers. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8212.48s)]
*  And he didn't understand what that meant by that, [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8215.26s)]
*  like containers for what? [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8217.92s)]
*  He's like, I don't know, [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8220.0s)]
*  but they think of us as containers. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8221.24s)]
*  And you would think maybe containers for souls, [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8223.82s)]
*  if the soul's a real thing, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8227.68s)]
*  and look, the concept of the soul has existed forever. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8229.28s)]
*  Very unusual for the concept of something [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8232.8s)]
*  to exist for a long time with no basis in reality. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8235.34s)]
*  That's why I'm interested in dragons. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8239.82s)]
*  Why is every civilization, [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8242.3s)]
*  why do they all have dragons? [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8244.1s)]
*  They mention dragons in the Bible a bunch of times. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8245.42s)]
*  They don't mention dinosaurs. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8247.66s)]
*  Well, I think because people weren't alive [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8249.58s)]
*  when dinosaurs were alive, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8251.7s)]
*  but I bet they were alive when dragons were alive. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8252.66s)]
*  I bet dragons were a real thing. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8254.66s)]
*  And in fact, Forrest Galante, [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8256.02s)]
*  who's a wildlife biologist, [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8257.66s)]
*  believes that there's a real possibility [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8259.3s)]
*  that dragons were an actual animal. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8261.54s)]
*  But that if you have an animal [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8263.3s)]
*  that has bones that are similar, like bird bones, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8266.039999999999s)]
*  and something that we select, [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8268.92s)]
*  how many of them would you find? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8270.64s)]
*  What would you find that's left of that? [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8272.56s)]
*  Most things don't fossilize. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8275.24s)]
*  I think dinosaurs are dragons. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8277.0s)]
*  That's what I think they were. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8279.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's possible that there was some form of, [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8280.6s)]
*  look, birds survived this impact in the Yucatan. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8283.52s)]
*  Whatever killed the dinosaurs did not kill chickens, [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8289.28s)]
*  because chickens are literal dinosaurs. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8292.52s)]
*  They're literal dinosaurs. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8295.28s)]
*  And if you ever seen a chicken eat a mouse, [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8296.800000000001s)]
*  it's fucking wild. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8298.48s)]
*  They're the most ruthless, ferocious little animals, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8299.84s)]
*  raptors, birds, those are all not eagles. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8303.2s)]
*  American eagle's a goddamn dinosaur. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8305.560000000001s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8307.32s)]
*  They're dinosaurs that live. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8308.16s)]
*  And in fact, some of the more recent models [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8309.2s)]
*  of what dinosaurs looked like, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8312.04s)]
*  they've updated to add feathers. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8313.800000000001s)]
*  When I was in, what is that? [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8316.0s)]
*  I just saw this earlier today. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8318.720000000001s)]
*  Dinosaurs preserve tail and amber. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8320.08s)]
*  So look at that, feathers. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8321.68s)]
*  Feathers in a dinosaur's tail. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8323.12s)]
*  So there's a museum in Bozeman, Montana. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8325.48s)]
*  And this museum has one side of this raptor, [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8330.28s)]
*  they have a velociraptor, and on one side of it, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8334.52s)]
*  they have, it's like a real size velociraptor. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8336.76s)]
*  And on one side, they have it with dinosaur skin, [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8339.6s)]
*  like we like to think of it. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8342.6s)]
*  But the other side, they have this theoretical version of it [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8343.800000000001s)]
*  that's covered in feathers. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8347.48s)]
*  That's probably what dinosaurs had. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8349.6s)]
*  So dinosaurs died during the impact, but not all of them. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8352.44s)]
*  The birds lived, and they're just smaller. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8358.4s)]
*  There was no food, okay? [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8360.960000000001s)]
*  So like a big Tyrannosaurus rex, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8361.960000000001s)]
*  there's nothing to eat, you're gonna starve to death. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8364.04s)]
*  Those things died off, but the little ones lived. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8365.44s)]
*  And it's so possible that something that flew, [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8368.32s)]
*  like a pterodactyl, like we think of pterodactyls [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8372.4s)]
*  as being like bat wings. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8375.52s)]
*  Maybe they had feathers. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8377.720000000001s)]
*  Maybe that was a gigantic fucking predatory bird. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8378.8s)]
*  And maybe some of those fucking things look like dragons. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8382.759999999998s)]
*  Maybe the images that, [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8387.16s)]
*  think of all these different cultures, [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8389.92s)]
*  ancient medieval Europe, China, Japan. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8391.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, China for sure. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8396.279999999999s)]
*  All of them had dragons. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8397.519999999999s)]
*  You're the dragon. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8399.679999999998s)]
*  There's so many dragons. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8400.679999999998s)]
*  Like it might have been a real thing. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8402.279999999999s)]
*  And I think most of them didn't have dragons [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8404.24s)]
*  that spit fire either. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8405.92s)]
*  I think that was like a fucking [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8406.96s)]
*  Hollywood movie, Godzilla type deal. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8409.0s)]
*  But do you think the alligator is a dinosaur? [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8411.519999999999s)]
*  Predates the dinosaurs. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8416.759999999998s)]
*  Crocodiles, crocodilian species predate dinosaurs. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8418.24s)]
*  Really? [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8420.88s)]
*  Yeah, looks like, what's the, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8421.72s)]
*  yeah, there was crocodiles and crocodile species, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8424.039999999999s)]
*  enormous ones by the way, that predated the dinosaur. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8426.72s)]
*  And I think modern alligators, they go back, [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8429.8s)]
*  they go back really, you know, sharks predate trees. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8435.4s)]
*  Really? [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8440.08s)]
*  Predate trees. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8440.92s)]
*  There was sharks on earth before there were trees. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8442.2s)]
*  Maybe we were all underwater for a long time. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8445.960000000001s)]
*  Well, life definitely existed underwater, [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8447.960000000001s)]
*  a long ass fucking time ago. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8451.28s)]
*  Because crocodiles are older than trees also. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8452.12s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8454.52s)]
*  Damn, that's crazy. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8455.52s)]
*  Yeah, so those are dinosaurs. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8457.08s)]
*  When you see a giant Nile crocodile, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8459.12s)]
*  those are fucking dinosaurs. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8461.84s)]
*  That's a type of reptile. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8463.04s)]
*  They scare me. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8465.2s)]
*  They should. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8466.04s)]
*  I'll be in Florida, we'll be driving those, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8466.880000000001s)]

*  I'm like, they're all the same to me. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8471.800000000001s)]
*  They scare the shit out of me, dude. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8475.28s)]
*  They should, they're fucking. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8477.0s)]
*  People walk in their dogs and they just come up and grab them [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8478.04s)]
*  and then the guy jumps in there [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8480.640000000001s)]
*  and like tries to save the dog. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Eso459GZM&t=8482.0s)]
