# Joe Rogan Experience #1888 - Michael Shermer
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5.72s)]
*  I come bearing signed gifts for you, sir. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=15.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=17.32s)]
*  I hope that's the right one. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=18.32s)]
*  Why the rational believe the irrational. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=22.28s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=23.28s)]
*  Is it simple? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=24.28s)]
*  It wouldn't be this big of a book if it was simple. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=25.28s)]
*  No. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=27.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, my argument is that it's not irrational to believe conspiracy theories [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=29.32s)]
*  because enough of them are true that it pays to err on the side of assuming more of them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=35.04s)]
*  are true than actually are, then missing real conspiracy theories and then that's a costlier [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=42.0s)]
*  error to make. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=47.88s)]
*  That's a rational perspective. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  The term conspiracy theory got thrown about. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=51.84s)]
*  There was the first introduction of it into the zeitgeist was during the Kennedy assassination, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=54.12s)]
*  correct? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  Well, around that time, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Before that, before World War II, really, conspiracy theories were kind of common knowledge. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=63.8s)]
*  Everybody knew that things were going on behind closed doors and it was just kind of commonly [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=68.44s)]
*  known and we just kind of try to figure it out. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  It didn't become really fringy until right after the JFK thing that it kind of got as [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  a meme that you're crazy to think these conspiracy theories are true. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=80.72s)]
*  It became pathologized. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  Richard Hofstadter's, you know, the paranoid style in American politics kind of put that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  on the map. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=93.0s)]
*  It's conspiracy theories are something delusional. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=94.0s)]
*  It's a pathology in your brain. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=97.52s)]
*  Whereas before that, it wasn't. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=99.52s)]
*  It was just, I mean, even the Declaration of Independence, it's a conspiracy theory. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=100.6s)]
*  It's saying, look, the British are doing this whole train of abuses and usurpations and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=104.28s)]
*  here's what we think they're up to and here's what we think they want to do. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=109.12s)]
*  And we're against that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=111.88s)]
*  That's printed right there in the declaration. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=112.88s)]
*  So it's not fringy, right? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=114.28s)]
*  It was kind of commonly known that these things happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  The term as a pejorative, though, was it was introduced into like sort of the American [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=118.6s)]
*  culture around the Kennedy assassination. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=125.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting story because I'm convinced Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=128.24s)]
*  Really? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=133.88s)]
*  Yes, I am. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=134.88s)]
*  What makes you convinced of that? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=135.88s)]
*  I have a whole chapter on it and we can get into that in a second. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=137.68s)]
*  But the twist about it where it seems like there was something up was that President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=139.24s)]
*  Johnson was worried that if it looks like there's a conspiracy afoot with the Cubans [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=146.04s)]
*  or the Russians, that that could lead to a nuclear exchange. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=152.04s)]
*  So we don't want the American people to think that this is some kind of vast conspiracy [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=155.76s)]
*  of the Russians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Have you gone back and forth on that at all? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=161.51999999999998s)]
*  Or is it just something you've always believed? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=164.28s)]
*  No, no, I well, before the Oliver Stone film, I hadn't really given it that much thought. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=166.2s)]
*  Well, the Warren Report seems pretty thorough, but who knows? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=171.12s)]
*  What do I know? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=175.39999999999998s)]
*  And then the Oliver Stone film, which floats every conspiracy theory there was in one package, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=176.39999999999998s)]
*  and I thought, well, 10 percent of this is true. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  Seems like there was something else going on. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=183.48s)]
*  But then there were web pages posted of like, here are all the mistakes in the film and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  here are all the counterarguments. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=191.0s)]
*  And then I read Gerald Posner's book, Case Closed, about the life of Lee Harvey Oswald [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=192.96s)]
*  and why all the evidence points to him. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=196.52s)]
*  And then Vincent Boeosi's book, Reclaiming History, which is like 1500 pages long, and [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=198.36s)]
*  it dissects every one of the hundreds of conspiracy theories. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=204.32s)]
*  There are something on the order of 140 people have been accused and a couple hundred organizations [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=207.4s)]
*  have been affiliated with the JFK assassination. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=213.88s)]
*  The problem is that there's no convergence of evidence to any other one than Lee Harvey [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=217.24s)]
*  Oswald acting alone. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=222.4s)]
*  And all the evidence points to him. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=224.76s)]
*  So it's not impossible. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=226.4s)]
*  All the evidence points to him. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=228.04s)]
*  Massive amounts of evidence, right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=229.84s)]
*  So now we're supposed to get a new trunche of documents. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=232.04s)]
*  But they're not. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=236.0s)]
*  They won't release them. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=237.0s)]
*  They keep stopping the release of these documents. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=238.12s)]
*  This worries me because that makes people suspicious, as it should. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  So any back to... [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=245.44s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=247.12s)]
*  It worries you because it makes people suspicious or it worries you because it points to their [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=248.12s)]
*  withholding information because that information looks bad? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=253.48s)]
*  I would love to see the information and I would change my mind in a heartbeat. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=258.24s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the magic bullet? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=261.84s)]
*  OK, the magic bullet is not a magic bullet. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=264.08s)]
*  It's a single bullet theory. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=266.36s)]
*  That is, what it's usually rendered as is Kennedy and Connolly are sitting like this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=267.48s)]
*  I'm aware of all of it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=273.15999999999997s)]
*  So the bullet doesn't have to go left, right and so forth. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=275.4s)]
*  Kennedy was elevated. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=278.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=279.0s)]
*  So if you draw a line straight back to the sixth floor window of the book depository [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=280.0s)]
*  building, the bullet goes straight through his back, out his neck, into Connolly, through [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=284.2s)]
*  his arm, into his leg and so forth in a straight line. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=288.6s)]
*  Well, you know the only reason why they had to come up with the theory that that one bullet [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=292.56s)]
*  did all that damage. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=296.6s)]
*  You know that, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=297.96s)]
*  Well... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=298.96s)]
*  Do you know why? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=299.96s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=300.96s)]
*  Go ahead and give me your... [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=301.96s)]
*  Because someone was hit by a ricochet in the underpass. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=302.96s)]
*  And so they had to attribute all that damage to one bullet. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  But there's more in Connolly's body, there was more pieces of bullet than were missing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=310.08s)]
*  from the actual bullet itself. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=316.2s)]
*  Did you ever look at the actual bullet itself? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=318.52s)]
*  Have you studied it? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=320.2s)]
*  Yeah, I have a picture of it in there. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=321.2s)]
*  Yeah, I know a lot about bullets. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=322.64s)]
*  And one of the problems about bullets is there's never been a bullet that's gone through bone [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=324.4s)]
*  and shattered bone and gone through two different bodies and came out looking like that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=328.12s)]
*  That looks like a bullet that was shot into water. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=332.04s)]
*  It is deformed though, if you look at that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=334.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's slightly deformed, but every bullet that leaves a gun is slightly deformed. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=336.40000000000003s)]
*  That indicates even more so that it didn't hit anything. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=339.64000000000004s)]
*  When bullets hit things, they deform. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=343.88s)]
*  That's the whole purpose of making bullets like that. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=346.16s)]
*  These bullets are designed to shatter things and expand upon impact and it creates more [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=349.44s)]
*  damage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, hollow point bullets are. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  Sure, but all bullets are. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  Hollow points even more specifically, but all bullets are designed to expand upon impact. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=358.88s)]
*  Even rifle bullets that are copper, because in California you can't use lead bullets anymore [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=365.32s)]
*  because condors and a lot of other birds of prey, they eat the lead bullets and they get [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  lead poisoning. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  Because if there's an animal that gets shot and the hunter doesn't recover it and then [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  the condor or something else eats that, some sort of a raptor eats that, then they get [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=380.4s)]
*  lead poisoning. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  But bullets expand and they break up. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=386.04s)]
*  They don't look like that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=388.24s)]
*  That bullet was found in Connolly's Gurney, which is so ridiculous. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=389.8s)]
*  The idea that, oh look, we found the bullet here. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=394.36s)]
*  It just managed to magically fall out of his body and look pristine. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=396.6s)]
*  Okay, 80% of the ear witnesses heard three shots. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, witnesses. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  And the first shot missed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  But witnesses. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=406.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but okay. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=407.96000000000004s)]
*  That's just asking people what happened. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=410.36s)]
*  If you talk to witnesses after 9-11, they said they heard explosions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=412.36s)]
*  Yes, right. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=415.44s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=416.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=417.44s)]
*  So again, it's a probability argument. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=418.44s)]
*  It's not black or white. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=419.76s)]
*  But the probability of that having gone through bodies is very low. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=420.76s)]
*  Well I don't know if you've seen those tests where they shoot the bullet through the foam [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=427.44s)]
*  stuff that mimics a human body and so forth. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=435.6s)]
*  Yeah, but that's gel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  That's ballistic gel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=440.2s)]
*  Batsy gel is not bone. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=441.92s)]
*  But they have shot it through pigs with the bone and tendons and ligaments and muscles [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=443.6s)]
*  and all that. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=447.6s)]
*  It never looks like that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=448.6s)]
*  Well anyway, there's good shows on this. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=449.6s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=451.44s)]
*  It never looks like that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=452.44s)]
*  There's no evidence of bullets hitting bone where they come out looking like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=454.6s)]
*  I don't know, Joe. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=458.92s)]
*  Are you sure? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=459.92s)]
*  I am sure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=460.92s)]
*  Because I'm pretty sure it was either NOVA or National Geographic that did this and replicated [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=461.92s)]
*  it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=465.72s)]
*  Shot it right through a body. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=466.72s)]
*  No, I saw that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=467.72s)]
*  They looked deformed. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=468.72s)]
*  The bullets looked deformed. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=469.72s)]
*  They were bent up. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=472.52000000000004s)]
*  So what is your counter then? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  Where is the fourth shot? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  I think Lee Harvey Oswald was involved. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=476.52000000000004s)]
*  I certainly think he was involved. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=479.92s)]
*  And I think the possibility of a conspiracy is high. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  I do not know whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=485.24s)]
*  I think Lee Harvey Oswald was most certainly a part of it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=488.64000000000004s)]
*  But when Lee Harvey Oswald was captured, when they were talking to him, he said, I'm a Batsy. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=491.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm inclined to believe he was a Batsy. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=496.48s)]
*  But I'm also inclined to believe that he had knowledge of it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=498.4s)]
*  He was there for probably a very specific reason. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=501.35999999999996s)]
*  And they were probably setting him up. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=504.64s)]
*  I think there was probably multiple people involved. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=506.28s)]
*  Yeah, who's the they? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=508.2s)]
*  Who is the they? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=509.67999999999995s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=510.67999999999995s)]
*  Is it the CIA? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  Was it the mafia? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=512.68s)]
*  Were they upset because he turned on them after they got him elected? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=513.68s)]
*  Because there was a conspiracy to help him get elected. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=518.9399999999999s)]
*  The mob was involved in getting JFK elected. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=522.36s)]
*  Was it the people that were upset because of the Bay of Pigs incident? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=526.28s)]
*  Was it the CIA because he wanted to disband them? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=529.8399999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=532.64s)]
*  I think there was a lot of people that John F. Kennedy upset. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=533.64s)]
*  Well that's true for every president, though. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=537.0s)]
*  But the ones that don't get shot, then no one pays attention to that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=538.76s)]
*  How many people hated Trump or Nixon, especially? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=541.8399999999999s)]
*  Right, but we're talking about an actual murder. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=544.12s)]
*  You're not saying to say it's true of every president is fine. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=546.72s)]
*  But we're talking about a president that was murdered. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  And you look at the people that may have had some sort of a vested interest in getting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=553.6s)]
*  rid of them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=557.4s)]
*  Okay, so here's one argument I'm making. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=558.4s)]
*  It's the argument from proportionality. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=560.24s)]
*  That the effect should have a matching size cause. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=562.4s)]
*  So let me just back up here for a second. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=566.02s)]
*  If you take a little pebble and throw it, it doesn't take a lot of effort to do it. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=567.58s)]
*  A fist size stone takes more effort, a big boulder, massive effort. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=571.2s)]
*  So our folk physics, we feel like cause and effect should match, right? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=575.88s)]
*  So interesting experiment if you take subjects and give them two dice and say, okay, now [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=579.7s)]
*  try to roll a low number. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=583.5s)]
*  They'll kind of just gently toss it like that. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=585.3000000000001s)]
*  Now try to roll a high number, like an 11 or 12. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=587.58s)]
*  They'll give it a good heave like that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=589.9000000000001s)]
*  Well that's dumb people. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=591.34s)]
*  Well, but that's our intuitions. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=592.34s)]
*  But that's people that don't know about dice. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=594.4200000000001s)]
*  We're not talking about trained assassins. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=596.86s)]
*  Okay, but let me finish. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=598.7s)]
*  So our sense is that big events, JFK assassination, Princess Die, dies, 9-11, COVID-19. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=600.46s)]
*  Counterfactually if Oswald had missed Kennedy or just wounded him and he didn't die, would [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=610.5400000000001s)]
*  there be massive conspiracy theories about who he was? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so this has actually happened. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=618.94s)]
*  John Hinckley. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=620.82s)]
*  Hold on a minute. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=621.82s)]
*  That's a straw man because you're saying that Oswald did act alone if he had missed. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=622.82s)]
*  Yeah, if he had missed. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=627.1s)]
*  But we're talking about after the murder. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=629.06s)]
*  The reason why there's a conspiracy is because he was murdered. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  So why are there no conspiracy theories about John Hinckley shooting Reagan? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=636.02s)]
*  Because John Hinckley has a real trail of mental illness. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=640.74s)]
*  He wrote letters to Jodie Foster. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=643.9799999999999s)]
*  He was a very specific human being who was obsessed with killing Reagan to impress Jodie [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=645.9399999999999s)]
*  Foster. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=651.6999999999999s)]
*  It's all really documented. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=652.9s)]
*  He's out now too. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=654.62s)]
*  It's not like they got rid of him, like they got rid of Jack Ruby. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=656.18s)]
*  Or Squeaky Fromm tried to shoot Gerald Ford. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=659.0999999999999s)]
*  Okay, but she missed. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=661.62s)]
*  But she was also in the Manson family. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=663.54s)]
*  There's a big conspiracy about that, about the Manson family and the fact that Charles [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=665.62s)]
*  Manson was a part of NK Ultra. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=670.78s)]
*  Oh yes, right. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=672.78s)]
*  Yes, right. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=673.78s)]
*  Did you ever read Chaos by Tom O'Neill? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=674.78s)]
*  No, I haven't read that one. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=677.02s)]
*  It's a fantastic book. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=678.5799999999999s)]
*  It's all about why Manson kept getting released. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=679.9s)]
*  Manson was in jail, right? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=683.5s)]
*  And during the time he was in jail, he was visited by Jolly West, who was the head of [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=686.46s)]
*  the CIA's MK Ultra LSD experiments. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=691.02s)]
*  They most certainly did something to Manson while he was in jail. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=694.78s)]
*  And they also supplied him, there's anecdotal evidence that shows that they supplied him [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=700.06s)]
*  with LSD when he got out of jail. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=704.3s)]
*  Every time he got arrested for violating parole, these cops and these local sheriffs that had [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=706.5s)]
*  caught him were told that it was above their pay grade and they had to release him. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=711.14s)]
*  Manson got out for multiple offenses after he was on parole, things that should have [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=716.34s)]
*  kept him locked up. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=721.86s)]
*  There's some real good evidence that, you know about, MK Ultra was a real thing. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=723.86s)]
*  And that's an interesting conspiracy, right? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=728.38s)]
*  Because it's a real one, documented. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=730.3s)]
*  Our own government was doing this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=732.1s)]
*  Yeah, well there's Operation Midnight Climax that they were involved with, where they were, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=733.42s)]
*  do you know about that one? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=737.34s)]
*  That's where they were dosing up Johns when they would go to visit prostitutes and they [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=738.82s)]
*  would film them through two-way mirrors. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=742.34s)]
*  He was, Jolly West was a part of that and he also was a part in some way, shape or form [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=745.9s)]
*  of that Manson family. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=751.52s)]
*  Okay, but my point is that if it, let's say it was the mayor of Dallas that was shot that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=753.4200000000001s)]
*  day, would there be vast conspiracy industry of books and films and so on? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=757.22s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=760.94s)]
*  But it wasn't the mayor, it was the president of the United States, which makes it a far [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=761.94s)]
*  bigger issue. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=765.02s)]
*  Right, that's my point. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=766.02s)]
*  We want something big. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=767.02s)]
*  It doesn't seem right that a lone nut like Lee Harvey Oswald could have pulled this off [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=768.02s)]
*  or that 19 guys with box cutters could have taken down the World Trade Center buildings. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=772.98s)]
*  It just doesn't feel right. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=776.9399999999999s)]
*  So we add elements, this is my theory, we add elements of causality to match it. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=778.4399999999999s)]
*  Princes die, cause of death, drunk driving, speeding, no seatbelt. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=782.9s)]
*  But it doesn't feel right that a princess, famous and so forth, would die the same way [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=786.02s)]
*  most people do. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=790.26s)]
*  Yeah, but you're adding a bunch of different conspiracies to one that's very specific. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=791.26s)]
*  You're adding a bunch that are much more easily disprovable than one that's very specific. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=795.5s)]
*  This is my problem with all conspiracy theories. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=800.38s)]
*  And one of the things that you said at the beginning, some of them are real. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=804.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=806.98s)]
*  All right, so let's distinguish conspiracy theories from conspiracies. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=807.98s)]
*  Conspiracies by definition are two or more people plotting in secret to gain an unfair, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=811.62s)]
*  illegal or immoral advantage over somebody else. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=815.18s)]
*  That happens all the time, right? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=817.58s)]
*  Sure. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=819.02s)]
*  So how do we know, so it's a signal detection problem. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=820.02s)]
*  How do you know which conspiracy theories are correct? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=821.86s)]
*  They tag an actual conspiracy, right? [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=825.14s)]
*  So I draw this two by two grid. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=827.8199999999999s)]
*  So up here you have real conspiracy theories that are real and you associate them with [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=829.6999999999999s)]
*  that correctly. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=837.58s)]
*  You say, yeah, that's what I agree. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=838.58s)]
*  That's a hit. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=840.98s)]
*  So conspiracy theories that are real and you go, no, I don't believe it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=841.98s)]
*  I don't think there's a real conspiracy. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=844.5s)]
*  That's a miss. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=845.78s)]
*  So that's a big miss, right? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=846.86s)]
*  That's a type two error. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=848.14s)]
*  You don't want to miss those because those are real. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=849.28s)]
*  That could harm you. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=850.98s)]
*  Down here you have conspiracy theories that are not true and you think they are. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=852.4599999999999s)]
*  So that's a false positive, a type one error. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=856.26s)]
*  That's a low cost error to make. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  Doesn't cost a lot. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=859.9s)]
*  It's not risky to assume a conspiracy theory is real when it's not. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=860.9s)]
*  And so this is my argument is that we've evolved this cognition to be very suspicious and paranoid [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=864.86s)]
*  about other people and what they're doing because historically and evolutionarily wise [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=870.14s)]
*  in these small bands and tribes of hunter-gatherers, anthropologists tell us there's a lot of conniving [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=875.38s)]
*  cabals and so on. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=881.62s)]
*  This goes on. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=883.38s)]
*  So I call this constructive conspiracism. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=884.42s)]
*  It pays to be a little paranoid because sometimes they really are out to get you. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=886.26s)]
*  But it also pays to be rational and recognize which ones are conspiracies and which ones [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=890.42s)]
*  are probably people just in the moment of chaos like 9-11 adding a bunch of stuff to [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=894.6s)]
*  what they've experienced in just the chaos of the incident. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=902.94s)]
*  I've heard explosions. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=907.34s)]
*  I saw this. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=908.94s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=909.94s)]
*  In times like that of great distress, people and eyewitness testimonies are some of the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=911.7s)]
*  most unreliable because people are so blown away by the extreme moment that they can't [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=916.2600000000001s)]
*  really recall things correctly. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=923.5400000000001s)]
*  OK. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=925.0600000000001s)]
*  Let's just do another counterfactual. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=926.0600000000001s)]
*  What would be true if this really was a conspiracy? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=928.4200000000001s)]
*  Well, there should be some documentation somewhere. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=930.86s)]
*  There is. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=933.46s)]
*  And that's why they won't release it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=934.46s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=935.46s)]
*  So this is the problem. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=936.46s)]
*  Release it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=937.5s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=938.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=939.5s)]
*  There's no possible reason in good. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=940.66s)]
*  I thought Trump was going to release it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=943.18s)]
*  I was quite surprised. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=944.54s)]
*  I don't think they want to let anybody release that stuff. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=945.54s)]
*  If I had to guess, it would be something like what the CIA was up to even more than what [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=948.58s)]
*  we know about, you know, overthrowing, rigging elections in South American countries, assassinating [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=952.86s)]
*  communist dictators. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=958.06s)]
*  Real conspiracies. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=959.3s)]
*  These are real conspiracies. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=960.3s)]
*  These things happen. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=961.3s)]
*  We found out about this in the 90s. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=962.3s)]
*  So why are you so convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=963.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=966.66s)]
*  So let's just pull back for a second. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=967.66s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=968.66s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=969.8199999999999s)]
*  You're not either. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=970.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm not omniscient. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=971.8199999999999s)]
*  We don't know for sure what happened. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=972.8199999999999s)]
*  Nobody does. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=973.8199999999999s)]
*  I like to get you in a room with Oliver Stone because Oliver Stone is so compelling. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=974.8199999999999s)]
*  That guy will talk for days and days about it. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=978.54s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=981.02s)]
*  I know. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=982.02s)]
*  I watched his four hour documentary. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=983.02s)]
*  I watched him on here. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=984.02s)]
*  What did you think about it? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=985.02s)]
*  Well, OK. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=986.02s)]
*  So again, here's my problem is that it's not just a black and white thing. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=987.02s)]
*  What's most likely to be true? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=989.1s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=990.86s)]
*  Well, the evidence is massive against Lee Harvey Oswald. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=991.86s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=994.06s)]
*  For sure, he was at least involved. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=995.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=996.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=997.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=999.58s)]
*  So Stone, the CIA, Alan Dulles, something. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1000.58s)]
*  If you had Alan Dulles here, could you get a grand jury to agree we have enough evidence [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1003.62s)]
*  to put him on trial? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1008.5s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1009.5s)]
*  There's nobody, in fact, that you could point to. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1010.98s)]
*  But we're talking about something that happened over 50 years ago. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1012.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, just rewind the tape to 10 years after or something. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1015.66s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1018.94s)]
*  So we got somebody. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1019.94s)]
*  Here he is. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1020.94s)]
*  Well, this actually happened, right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1021.94s)]
*  Jim Garrison put on trial Clay Shaw and pointed all the evidence he could find. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1022.94s)]
*  And the jury acquitted him in under an hour. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1028.42s)]
*  The jury also acquitted O.J. Simpson. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1029.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1031.94s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1032.94s)]
*  You know, I don't know if that's real good evidence. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1033.94s)]
*  Juries are, you know, they're not the most informed people. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1036.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, there was a made for television BBC trial of Lee Harvey Oswald in absentia in [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1040.8200000000002s)]
*  which was it Jerry Spence was his defense attorney in absentia. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1046.0600000000002s)]
*  And and what's his name was was the prosecutor. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1052.54s)]
*  The reclaiming history, the Manson guy, the guy put Manson away. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1056.02s)]
*  I just mentioned his name. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1060.98s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1061.98s)]
*  I'm spacing out on it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1062.98s)]
*  We also be Vincent Bojose. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1063.98s)]
*  Again, the jury again, it's not a real jury. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1064.98s)]
*  It's a made for TV series. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1068.06s)]
*  But they present all the evidence and they acquitted. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1069.7s)]
*  I mean, they convicted Oswald based on the evidence as the lone assassin because there [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1073.46s)]
*  was just nothing pointing to anybody else. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1078.7s)]
*  So here's how I think about it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1082.02s)]
*  There could be somebody else involved, but we need some evidence, at least some paper [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1083.18s)]
*  trail. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1089.02s)]
*  Why in the Pentagon papers that released all these top secret documents that Nixon tried [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1090.02s)]
*  to cover up and prevent from being published? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1094.38s)]
*  There's nothing in there about, you know, the conspiracy to assassinate the CIA involved [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1096.8200000000002s)]
*  in stop release of all of the documents about the Kennedy assassination. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1100.38s)]
*  They keep postponing decades and decades. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1105.22s)]
*  My guess is probably the CIA was up to even more no good back in the 60s and 70s. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1108.46s)]
*  You know, we know you've mentioned MKUltra. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1113.82s)]
*  Don't forget that's a good guess. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1116.26s)]
*  But another good guess is they were involved in the assassination in some way. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1118.48s)]
*  OK, then I'm a good Bayesian. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1122.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to update my priors, change my credence and change my mind completely. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1124.02s)]
*  Go. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1128.78s)]
*  Yes, but I'm just very suspicious of multiple parts of that assassination, including the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1129.78s)]
*  fact that, you know, do you know that Jolly West visited Jack Ruby while he was in jail [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1136.96s)]
*  and Jack Ruby? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1141.92s)]
*  Something happened to when he went fucking completely insane after visiting with Jolly [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1143.76s)]
*  West. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1147.2s)]
*  And the assumption is that Jolly West gave Jack Ruby LSD while he was in jail. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1148.2s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1152.48s)]
*  But why would Jolly West go to visit the guy that killed Lee Harvey Oswald when he was [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1153.48s)]
*  the head of a mind control experiment for the CIA? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1158.56s)]
*  Again, this is what's called anomaly hunting. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1161.96s)]
*  That's a giant anomaly. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1166.04s)]
*  Like the umbrella guy, the umbrella man, Louis Witt on the. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1170.04s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of that silly shit. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1173.32s)]
*  But that points to be to this thing where people always try to look for connections. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1176.72s)]
*  And I do agree with you that a lot of conspiracy theories are ridiculous. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1182.2s)]
*  But a lot of conspiracies, as you said, are real. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1186.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, but I have a feeling that there were other [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1189.1s)]
*  people involved based on the evidence, based on a lot of it. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1194.26s)]
*  In like Stone's thesis that the CIA military industrial complex and so on were involved [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1199.14s)]
*  because Kennedy wanted to get us out of Vietnam. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1204.32s)]
*  Nixon got us out of Vietnam. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1206.66s)]
*  How come no one assassinated him from the military industrial complex? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1208.06s)]
*  Well, that's only one piece that, I mean, his assumption that it was because of them [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1210.42s)]
*  trying to get out of Vietnam was only one of the assumptions that they made. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1215.9s)]
*  His other assumptions were the mob. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1219.8799999999999s)]
*  It was the CIA. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1222.56s)]
*  He wanted to get rid of a lot of the intelligence agencies. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1224.66s)]
*  He had a real problem with secret societies and secrecy and secrecy in government. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1228.94s)]
*  He made that famous speech about secret societies. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1234.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1238.18s)]
*  Well, and again, it's complicated by the fact that we did try to invade Cuba using Cuban [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1239.18s)]
*  nationalists in the Bay of Pigs. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1244.5800000000002s)]
*  That was a disaster. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1246.66s)]
*  Also, Operation Northwoods. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1247.66s)]
*  Operation Northwoods. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1249.74s)]
*  That's one of the creepiest ones. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1250.74s)]
*  Oh, totally. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1253.26s)]
*  The fact that that was a real conspiracy, that they were really planning blowing up [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1254.26s)]
*  a drone jetliner and blaming on the Cubans. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1259.08s)]
*  They were going to arm Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo Bay, all to get us to go [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1262.32s)]
*  to war with Cuba. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1266.72s)]
*  It's pretty wild that that was signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and vetoed by Kennedy. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1267.72s)]
*  And McNamara. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1273.52s)]
*  He didn't go for it either. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1274.52s)]
*  But this is an example, again, of constructive conspiracism. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1275.7s)]
*  It's not irrational to think that a lot of conspiracy theories might be true because [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1279.04s)]
*  enough of them have been. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1283.56s)]
*  Or Cointel Pro, where the FBI was sending in agents to act as social justice activists [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1285.58s)]
*  in American Indian movement, feminist groups, the Black Panthers, and so on. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1293.2s)]
*  Including blackmailing Martin Luther King Jr. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1302.2s)]
*  Recording his sexcapades in hotel rooms. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  Our government was doing this? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1308.2s)]
*  What? [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1309.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  The guy who assassinated Martin Luther King. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  Ray. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1314.4s)]
*  Ray. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1315.4s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1316.4s)]
*  It escapes me. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1317.4s)]
*  What is his name? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1318.4s)]
*  James Earl Ray. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1323.4s)]
*  James Earl Ray. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1324.4s)]
*  I always forget that guy's name for some reason. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1325.4s)]
*  But I talked to Mike Baker, who was formerly with the CIA. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1328.2s)]
*  I use air quotes formally. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1332.24s)]
*  He had investigated that for his television show. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1334.88s)]
*  And he said, that is one of the weirdest ones. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1338.24s)]
*  Because that guy was funded in some strange way. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1340.7600000000002s)]
*  He was kind of a loser. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1343.6000000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he had money. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1344.6000000000001s)]
*  Someone he believes was involved in aiding that guy to assassinate Martin Luther King. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1349.7600000000002s)]
*  Again, so we have the WikiLeaks. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1355.4s)]
*  Millions and millions of top secret documents. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1359.44s)]
*  Why is there no mention of 9-11 as an inside job? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1361.92s)]
*  Some documentation of somebody inside. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1364.56s)]
*  Maybe 9-11 wasn't an inside job. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1366.6s)]
*  Maybe that's why. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1368.52s)]
*  And why is there nothing about JFK or the fake moon landing? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1369.52s)]
*  Nothing like that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1373.36s)]
*  So we would expect if X was true that the following should happen. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1374.36s)]
*  Yeah, but WikiLeaks didn't get all of the documents that the government has ever hidden. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1378.3999999999999s)]
*  That's a weird way to connect the dots there, Mr. Shermer. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1383.48s)]
*  I'm disconnecting the dots. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1386.6399999999999s)]
*  Are you working for the governor or the government? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1387.6399999999999s)]
*  What's going on with you? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1390.6s)]
*  I'm an agent of disinformation. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1392.2s)]
*  I've been accused of that, actually. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1393.76s)]
*  Have you been? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1395.04s)]
*  I think I have been, too. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1396.04s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1397.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1398.04s)]
*  But I mean, again, how do these systems really work? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1399.04s)]
*  So this is my kind of conspiracy detection kit. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1402.68s)]
*  The grander the conspiracy theory, the less likely it is to be true. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1405.92s)]
*  Like say Volkswagen cheating the emission standards in Europe. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1409.36s)]
*  That's a very specific conspiracy theory. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1414.2s)]
*  Turned out to be true. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1416.96s)]
*  They really did do that. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1417.96s)]
*  And for obvious reasons, profit motive, right? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1419.48s)]
*  If you scale up from that, oh, they're trying to control the entire European economy or [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1422.9199999999998s)]
*  something like, well, no, that's too big. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  They're just trying to make money. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1430.4399999999998s)]
*  They're just trying to make money, right? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1431.4399999999998s)]
*  So the more people that have to be involved, the more elements that have to come. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1432.6s)]
*  People are incompetent. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1437.4399999999998s)]
*  People can't keep their mouth shut. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1438.4399999999998s)]
*  For the most part. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1440.12s)]
*  For the most part, yes. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1441.12s)]
*  Now, to be fair to the other side, if you read about the development of the U-2 spy [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1442.12s)]
*  plane and the AR-71 Blackbird, you know, this was done in Burbank near where you used to [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1448.0800000000002s)]
*  live. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1454.28s)]
*  And that's right in the heart of LA. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1455.28s)]
*  How did they do this for all those years and nobody knew about it, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1456.52s)]
*  Well, they were acting on the interests of the government. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1460.16s)]
*  They were trying to be patriots. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1464.04s)]
*  They kept their mouth shut because they were trying to win a war against the evil others. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1465.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  So again, like with the recent UAP sightings, what I want my initial response is the SR-71 [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1471.36s)]
*  Blackbird was before it was declassified, there were commercial pilots going, oh my [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1479.32s)]
*  God, there's something going 3000 miles an hour, 50,000 feet above me at 30,000 feet. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1484.0s)]
*  This is impossible. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1489.9799999999998s)]
*  We don't have anything like that. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1490.9799999999998s)]
*  Well, actually we did have something like that. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1492.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1493.8s)]
*  So I suspect that some of these UAPs, I think in a decade or two, we're going to find out, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1494.8s)]
*  we had these incredible drones that could fly at these speeds. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1499.5600000000002s)]
*  I tend to lean towards that as well sometimes. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1502.5600000000002s)]
*  I go back and forth with it. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1504.72s)]
*  I had Ryan Graves on recently. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1505.92s)]
*  It was a fascinating conversation because the way he was describing things with no visible [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1509.0800000000002s)]
*  means of propulsion, no technology that we currently know is available could act in the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1513.8400000000001s)]
*  way those things were acting. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1520.5600000000002s)]
*  I wonder if that is what it is, if they have some sort of very advanced drones and the [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1522.16s)]
*  fact that they seem to be transmedium, they seem to be able to enter into the ocean and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1527.32s)]
*  then leave the ocean. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1532.44s)]
*  I wonder if that's something that we have because these things, one of the ones that [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1533.44s)]
*  he described is like a translucent circle with a black sphere inside of it and that [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1538.84s)]
*  when they updated their radar systems in 2014, they started seeing them all over the place [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1543.12s)]
*  on their systems and that these people spotted them visually and that they were behaving [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1548.36s)]
*  in a way like 130 mile an hour winds were completely stationary. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1553.76s)]
*  I wonder if those are super advanced drones. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1558.68s)]
*  Another problem with these videos is that they're very grainy, blurry, you can't quite [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1562.28s)]
*  make out what's going on. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1566.52s)]
*  Like the one that looks like it goes in the ocean comes back out. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1567.68s)]
*  It's not clear that it goes in the ocean because the horizon in the ocean is so blurry. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1570.4s)]
*  So I'm a member of this Galileo project at Harvard run by Avi Loeb, the head of the astronomy [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1576.24s)]
*  department there. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1580.68s)]
*  I had Avi on. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1581.68s)]
*  And he's raising money to put cameras, high resolution cameras all over the world, particularly [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1582.68s)]
*  in the places where people like Graves say these. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1589.44s)]
*  I mean when Graves told you, we saw these things every day, it's like every day, there [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1591.8s)]
*  surely must be high resolution photos of these things. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1596.8400000000001s)]
*  Those jets are not designed to take high resolution video. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1599.64s)]
*  They're designed to fight against enemy jets. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1603.16s)]
*  That's what they're designed for. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1606.44s)]
*  They're designed to recognize these enemy combatants and engage with them in the most [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1607.44s)]
*  effective way possible. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1612.2s)]
*  That's not with high resolution digital video. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1613.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1616.56s)]
*  Well, that would be the solution. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1617.56s)]
*  We just need better data. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1620.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, I wonder if they want better data. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  Now let's assume the federal government, imagine they are running top secret programs using [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1624.92s)]
*  advanced drones and the technology that we're not currently aware of. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1631.76s)]
*  And the United States government has these. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1636.6000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't want people taking videos of these things. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1639.16s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1642.3600000000001s)]
*  Right, but everyone has one of these in their pocket. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1643.72s)]
*  Yeah, but you can't get digital video of something that's seven miles away moving at the speed [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1646.76s)]
*  of sound. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1654.48s)]
*  You're not going to get digital video of that. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1655.48s)]
*  That's what we want to do with the Galeo project is get those cameras up there. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1657.16s)]
*  And according to Christopher Mellon, a guy who did work for the Defense Department, he [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1659.88s)]
*  said there are top secret videos and photographs that he's seen or that he's aware of that [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  are pretty spectacular that they don't understand. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1669.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1671.8799999999999s)]
*  I've heard him say that. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, then let's see them. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1673.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, we can't. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1675.12s)]
*  Yeah, but why would they release that? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1676.12s)]
*  This is the question is like if they just like the Blackbird, just like the Stealth [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  Bomber, many of the other projects that they have that were top secret before they became [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1681.84s)]
*  public, why would they release all that information? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1686.48s)]
*  Probably wouldn't. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1689.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1690.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1691.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1692.48s)]
*  I wonder what that stuff is in the fact that it happens so often in that very specific [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1693.48s)]
*  area. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1697.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, who knows? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1698.6399999999999s)]
*  Another thing I was thinking about with the UAPs is in the history of technology, no nation [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1700.8s)]
*  gets very far ahead of any other nation. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1704.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1706.96s)]
*  They either back engineer it or copy it or steal the secrets and so on. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1707.96s)]
*  It's not likely we would have anything that the Russians and Chinese wouldn't be pretty [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1711.84s)]
*  close to having also. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1716.22s)]
*  You know, just think of just the development of jets. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1717.22s)]
*  Or the development of the nuclear bomb. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1719.44s)]
*  The nuclear bomb. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1721.28s)]
*  1945 was Hiroshima and 1949 the Russians. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1723.28s)]
*  They stole our secrets, right? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1728.16s)]
*  So this idea that these are super advanced drones that we have and the Russians and Chinese [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1729.36s)]
*  don't have, it's not likely they would not know the technology that we know. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1734.92s)]
*  The physics, the aerodynamics and the engineering and all that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1739.12s)]
*  Because they read the same journals. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1743.28s)]
*  They do the same research we do. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1745.36s)]
*  So what do you think it is? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1747.44s)]
*  Well, I think it's probably multiple things. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1749.0s)]
*  I think some of them might be drones that just really high tech drones. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1751.3999999999999s)]
*  Some of them are just blurry videos that are... [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1756.4799999999998s)]
*  I think the one of the sphere inside the cube or the cubit-sized sphere is probably a balloon. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1758.24s)]
*  A balloon? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1763.76s)]
*  A balloon that stands stationary at 130 mile an hour winds? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1764.76s)]
*  Appears to stand stationary. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1768.8s)]
*  Appears with the most sophisticated tracking devices that these military jets have. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1770.6s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1775.04s)]
*  These are anomalies. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1776.04s)]
*  So we just need better data. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1777.04s)]
*  But why would you think it's a balloon? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1778.04s)]
*  Well, what else would it be? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1779.04s)]
*  Okay, it might be a drone. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1780.36s)]
*  Certainly probably not an alien spacecraft and so on. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1784.0s)]
*  Certainly probably not. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1787.0s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1788.0s)]
*  Well, this kind of gets into the argument of the SETI program. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1789.0s)]
*  There's so much empty space out there. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1792.32s)]
*  The chances of them finding us are pretty slim. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1794.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1797.6799999999998s)]
*  I separate two questions. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1798.6799999999998s)]
*  But we find planets all the time. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but telescopes, not invisible. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1802.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1806.52s)]
*  And all sorts of things that we send into space. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1807.52s)]
*  But we find planets all the time that are in the Goldilocks zone. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1810.56s)]
*  And we have a very...relatively unsophisticated in terms of what we'd expect from something [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1814.4s)]
*  that's capable of intergalactic travel. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1819.72s)]
*  Relatively simple technology in comparison to what we would think. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1823.32s)]
*  If you took what we have today and you increased our capabilities a thousand years from now, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1827.32s)]
*  you could imagine that it would be quite easy for someone to at least send a drone [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1835.2s)]
*  from another planet to visit Earth and observe. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1839.8s)]
*  This is the Fermi paradox that you know of. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1842.56s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1846.2s)]
*  Well, of course, most scientists like him don't think that they're here. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1847.2s)]
*  So I separate two questions. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  Most scientists? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  Most scientists. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1852.1200000000001s)]
*  Michio Kaku thinks they're here. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  He's been a little fuzzy about that. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1855.0s)]
*  He's not totally committed to that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1856.64s)]
*  He's totally committed. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1858.32s)]
*  He was here. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1859.32s)]
*  He was here and he talked about it on the podcast. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1860.32s)]
*  He said for the longest time he was a skeptic. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1862.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1864.8s)]
*  Okay, he has kind of come down on that side a little bit. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1865.8s)]
*  Why would you be firm on that? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1868.8s)]
*  When you think about the fact that there's hundreds of billions of galaxies in the known [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1870.12s)]
*  universe. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1875.2s)]
*  Let's separate two questions. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1876.2s)]
*  Are they out there? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1877.52s)]
*  Have they come here? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1878.52s)]
*  Are they out there? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1879.52s)]
*  Almost certainly. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1880.52s)]
*  I would say 99.9% they're out there. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1881.52s)]
*  I would agree with you. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1884.52s)]

*  Just do the numbers. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1888.32s)]
*  No matter how improbable it is you get from bacteria to big brains and civilization, it's [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1889.32s)]
*  going to happen. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1894.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1895.08s)]
*  But have they come here? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1896.08s)]
*  Okay, so how good is the evidence for that? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1897.8799999999999s)]
*  Not very. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1901.12s)]
*  It's pretty thin, right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1902.12s)]
*  How good? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1903.12s)]
*  It's anecdotal. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1904.12s)]
*  It's human eyewitnesses. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1905.12s)]
*  It's blurry videos, grainy photos. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1907.12s)]
*  If they were here, damn it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1910.56s)]
*  Pick up the widget on the dashboard and bring it back here. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1913.36s)]
*  But just looking at what we know that these fighter pilots have witnessed, the data that [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1917.12s)]
*  they've acquired, when they're looking at something like Commander David Fravor, who [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1922.68s)]
*  when they were off the coast with the Nimitz, when they tracked that thing that went from [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1928.48s)]
*  above 60,000 feet above sea level to 50 feet above sea level in less than a second. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1933.24s)]
*  What's that? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1938.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1939.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1940.76s)]
*  What is that thing that they have visual contact by multiple sources and they tracked it and [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1941.76s)]
*  they have video of this thing moving off at insane rates of speed. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1947.68s)]
*  What's that? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1952.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1953.16s)]
*  This is the problem with anomalies. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1954.16s)]
*  No theory explains everything. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1955.16s)]
*  But if there was any evidence that pointed to something that operated in a way that we [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1957.0800000000002s)]
*  can't comprehend any of the known technologies being able to reproduce, that's one of them. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1962.4s)]
*  But no technologies come out of a vacuum like that. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1967.88s)]
*  They always build on previous technologies. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  Right, but if you're talking about something from another planet or something from another [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1972.28s)]
*  civilization that we're not aware of that's on earth, maybe that lives in the water, we [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1977.2s)]
*  don't know. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1981.6s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1982.8s)]
*  When you're seeing these things, when you're talking about people that are the best fighter [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1984.1999999999998s)]
*  pilots that we have available, that are operating with the most sophisticated fighter jets, with [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1988.9199999999998s)]
*  tracking systems that are constantly being updated, and then when they update them, they [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1994.8s)]
*  start picking up these things, like Ryan Graves discussed on the podcast. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=1999.9599999999998s)]
*  Why would you think that those are not possibly something from somewhere else? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2005.1599999999999s)]
*  It depends on how you want to pose the problem. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2009.52s)]
*  So here's how I think about it. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2013.52s)]
*  So I take Leslie Keen's book on UFOs and pilots and generals go on the record and so on. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2015.4s)]
*  In that book she says 90 to 95% of all sightings have perfectly normal explanations. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2021.96s)]
*  I would probably agree that's true. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2027.92s)]
*  So the question is what do we do with that other 5% of anomalies? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2029.54s)]
*  No theory explains everything. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2033.56s)]
*  There's always going to be anomalies in every scientific theory. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2034.76s)]
*  What do you do with it? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2037.96s)]
*  You assign it to a graduate student to figure it out. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2039.4s)]
*  That's future research. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2042.0s)]
*  Rather than going to a grand theory of visitation by aliens or the Russians or Chinese have [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2044.44s)]
*  these super advanced technologies that we don't have or we have them and they don't [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2050.06s)]
*  have. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2053.48s)]
*  I mean again, if we had this technology, surely the Russians have something pretty close to [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2054.48s)]
*  that. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2058.32s)]
*  There's nothing from the videos in Ukraine of any Russian drones that act anything like [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2059.32s)]
*  these UAPs. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2064.44s)]
*  Surely they would use this technology if they had it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2065.44s)]
*  Well we're assuming that those UAPs are military in nature and not something that they use [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2067.56s)]
*  to observe things. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2074.24s)]
*  It could be. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2075.24s)]
*  I mean why would we assume that these things, if they're capable of behaving this way and [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2076.24s)]
*  they're just some sort of a device that can travel at insane rates of speed, why would [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2080.92s)]
*  we assume that those things can launch missiles or act in a military capacity? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2086.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2089.96s)]
*  And you know there are UAP sightings over Ukraine. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2090.96s)]
*  Yeah, but okay so Avi did a nice paper on that showing that these were artillery shells [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2094.36s)]
*  and not what the other people said they thought it was, that it was like a drone or a plane [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2101.08s)]
*  or something weird like that. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2106.16s)]
*  He showed that if it was what they thought it was, it would have had a much bigger impact [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2107.7s)]
*  going through the atmosphere at that speed and burning up. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2113.12s)]
*  But it didn't, so these are artillery shells. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2115.84s)]
*  Anyway, he did a nice paper on that. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2117.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2119.76s)]
*  What about these things that supposedly move far faster than the speed of sound without [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2121.1600000000003s)]
*  the sonic boom? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2126.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, how is that possible? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2127.48s)]
*  How is that possible? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2129.28s)]
*  That's right, it's not. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2130.28s)]
*  That's where it gets weird. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2131.28s)]
*  That's where it gets weird, right. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2132.28s)]
*  But is that's where the question is, is it ours? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2133.6800000000003s)]
*  Is it really moving at that speed or is it a misperception of the video, a miscalculation? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2136.6400000000003s)]
*  People make, scientists make miscalculations of these sorts of things all the time. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2141.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that was one of the things that was posed to David Fravor and he said they have [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2144.44s)]
*  multiple sources of data. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2148.24s)]
*  It's not just like one system that's monitoring these things, it's multiple systems. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2152.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2156.3999999999996s)]
*  And I follow these guys. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2157.3999999999996s)]
*  I agree they are incredibly credible, right, and they have good arguments. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2158.3999999999996s)]
*  What do you do with the anomaly? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2164.2999999999997s)]
*  I think you are an anti-conspiracy theorist. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2165.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2167.64s)]
*  No, I'm a skeptic, Joe. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2168.64s)]

*  I mean, I believe the theory of evolution. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2183.6800000000003s)]
*  I think the Big Bang Theory happened when people like Neil deGrasse Tyson and my quantum [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2186.32s)]
*  physics friends tell me quantum physics is true, this is how we know it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2191.92s)]
*  To me it's weird, spooky. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2195.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't really understand it, but okay, we have tons of evidence. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2197.1200000000003s)]
*  Have you seen some of the new discussions based on the observations from the James [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2201.72s)]
*  Webb Telescope that maybe the Big Bang Theory needs to be revisited? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2207.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes, vaguely. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2213.68s)]
*  It was the expansion rate changing, right, of the new... [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2215.6s)]
*  Well they're getting new data, right? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2219.48s)]
*  They're constantly getting new data. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2220.68s)]
*  We would assume that with more and more sophisticated ways of viewing the known universe that we [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2222.3599999999997s)]
*  could possibly get some new data that would change our ideas of what the theory of the [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2228.36s)]
*  Big Bang Theory or the theory of the universe itself would be. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2233.32s)]
*  And that's one of the things that they're discussing right now. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2236.92s)]
*  What was that? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2239.4s)]
*  There was a recent article. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2240.4s)]

*  It's the limitations of our technology. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2274.1200000000003s)]
*  So in the late 90s is when they discovered the universe is expanding at an accelerating [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2275.1200000000003s)]
*  rate. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2280.36s)]
*  Well, how can that be? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2281.36s)]
*  Because in an explosion, the initial explosion, the inflation in cosmology is really rapid, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2283.2799999999997s)]
*  then it slows and slows and slows. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2288.4399999999996s)]
*  So it was supposed to slow down in another 10 billion years or something and maybe collapse [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2290.48s)]
*  back on itself. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2294.8799999999997s)]
*  And then they discovered, oh my God, no, these type two supernova, whatever it was, indicate [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2295.8799999999997s)]
*  that the expansion is accelerating. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  So there's this weird force, dark energy, that pushes it away. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2302.62s)]
*  And dark matter is this proffered thing that explains why galaxies are held together because [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2307.08s)]
*  they don't have enough mass to hold them together in the structures that they are, as I understand [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2312.7599999999998s)]
*  it, and rotate it the way they're rotating. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2316.68s)]
*  So there's something else we can't see. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2318.98s)]
*  So when astronomers talk about dark energy and dark matter to explain these two anomalies, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2321.52s)]
*  how could this be? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2325.2s)]
*  That's not an explanation. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2326.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just a linguistic placeholder until we figure out what it is. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2328.36s)]
*  So surely there is going to be some discoveries of some kind of new energy or some kind of [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2332.84s)]
*  matter that we don't know. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2337.8s)]
*  Century from now, it's like, oh, of course, if you came back being chronically frozen, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2340.6400000000003s)]
*  oh, that's what it was. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2344.36s)]
*  So what would it take for you to look at? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2345.7200000000003s)]
*  What kind of discovery would it take in terms of UAPs for you to revisit your position and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2349.4s)]
*  highly likely that this is either something that we don't understand that we are observing [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2357.28s)]
*  that's come from somewhere else or something that we don't understand because it's technology [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2364.0400000000004s)]
*  that hasn't been released? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2368.0400000000004s)]
*  The actual specimen, the equivalent of the SR-71 Blackbird. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2369.1600000000003s)]
*  I can go to the museum. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2373.96s)]
*  I can see it, touch it, walk on it. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2374.96s)]
*  So do you hold it like, do you have a placeholder like perhaps? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2376.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2379.4s)]
*  I do. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2380.4s)]
*  I do. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2381.4s)]
*  Nothing's 100%, right? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2382.4s)]
*  Why is it so fun though to think that it's from somewhere else? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2383.4s)]
*  It's so much more fun to think that we're being visited than to think that our government [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2386.6s)]
*  has some super sophisticated, you know, gravity propelling drones that somehow or another [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2391.48s)]
*  violate our laws of space time. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2398.84s)]
*  Why is it so much more exciting to think that? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2401.44s)]
*  I think it's a religious impulse. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2403.12s)]
*  I think it's an idea that it feels like we're not alone. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2405.12s)]
*  And when you think about the narratives from different religions that there's something, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2410.16s)]
*  an agent, a person, a being of something, not just matter, not just the laws of nature. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2415.2799999999997s)]
*  Space daddy. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2420.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2421.48s)]
*  Like when Einstein says, well, like Spinoza is God, it's just the laws of nature are God. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2422.48s)]
*  That's not particularly comforting. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2427.08s)]
*  They don't even know I'm here. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2430.3599999999997s)]
*  But the idea that they're out there, they're super advanced and they know we're here, maybe [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2432.16s)]
*  they're even coming. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2435.96s)]
*  You know, it's like the day of the Earth stood still, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2436.96s)]
*  That was a kind of a film. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2439.12s)]
*  That was a Christ allegory. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2440.12s)]
*  Remember his earthly name was Mr. Carpenter in that film, in the first one, the 1951 film. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2441.52s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2446.72s)]
*  Klaatu. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2447.72s)]
*  Klaatu. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2448.72s)]
*  But his earthly name was Mr. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2449.72s)]
*  Klaatu Baratu Nikdu. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2450.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2451.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2452.72s)]
*  And that was really a reflection of, and by the way, in the climax scene where the authorities [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2453.72s)]
*  kill him and they put him in the tomb, it's like the crucifixion of Jesus and they put [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2459.96s)]
*  him in the tomb and three days later he's resurrected. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  And then she goes to the robot and says what you just said, Klaatu Baratu Nikdu, and he [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2468.12s)]
*  goes there, burns a hole into the morgue, takes the body, takes it back to the spaceship, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2474.04s)]
*  lays it on that slab, does some stuff with the lights, and he comes back to life. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2478.32s)]
*  Now in the original script, she, the Mary Magdalene character woman, says, Patricia [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2482.28s)]
*  Neal, you mean this is the power that extraterrestrials have? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2486.68s)]
*  And in the original one he goes, yeah, we have the power of life and death. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2490.92s)]
*  The Breen Censorship Board in 1950 said, no, no, no, you can't say that to the American [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2494.64s)]
*  public. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2498.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2499.68s)]
*  The censorship board said that? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2500.68s)]
*  Yeah, there was a Breen Censorship Board that censored films that said, you know, you can't [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2501.68s)]
*  defend religious people is one of their criteria. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2505.68s)]
*  Offend. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2508.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2509.0s)]
*  So they changed the script and now he says something like, oh no, no, we don't have the [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2510.0s)]
*  power, only the great spirit in the sky or something has that power. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2516.04s)]
*  I didn't know there was a censorship board that would monitor films and say, you can't [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2520.52s)]
*  say these things. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2525.44s)]
*  Same way we have for ratings, PG ratings. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2526.44s)]
*  Science fiction. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2529.12s)]
*  They had censorship boards for science fiction, but they didn't for vampires. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2530.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, even Star Trek, the original series, I mean, Roddenberry had to sneak in [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2533.12s)]
*  a lot of anti-Vietnam War commentary through these characters and had to be careful of [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2537.0s)]
*  how they were kind of presented because censorship boards are like that. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2542.64s)]
*  You know, they always got the woman, but you never saw anything, right? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2548.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2551.92s)]
*  But that's just how things were back then. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2552.92s)]
*  I didn't know that they would have a censorship board that would say you can't offend religious [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2555.04s)]
*  people by saying that aliens have the power to bring things back from the dead. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2559.6s)]
*  Right, because there it kind of secularizes God. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2564.32s)]
*  So in this scenario, I call it Shermer's Last Law, it's one of my Scientific American columns, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2568.24s)]
*  any sufficiently advanced extraterrestrial intelligence would be indistinguishable from [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2573.2s)]
*  God. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2576.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2577.36s)]
*  Because as you went through the scenario earlier, a thousand years more advanced than this, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2578.36s)]
*  a million years more advanced than this. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2581.0s)]
*  Look how far we've come in a hundred years. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2582.76s)]
*  Extrapolate that out. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2584.96s)]
*  They'd be able to engineer life forms, probably even engineer entire planetary systems to [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2586.2000000000003s)]
*  create Dyson spheres to capture this, all these fantastic scenarios. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2591.76s)]
*  That would all be possible if you had sufficient time and intelligence. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2595.94s)]
*  How would that be any different from what religions think God is? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2600.78s)]
*  Well, hasn't there been, wasn't there some sort of a recent experiment where they created [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2604.36s)]
*  an artificial life form that had, what was that thing? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2611.36s)]
*  Do you know, we discussed this. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2616.2400000000002s)]
*  It was, they had developed some sort of an artificial embryo. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2618.32s)]
*  You know what I'm talking about? [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2625.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2626.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2627.32s)]
*  Some sort of an artificially created embryo. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2628.32s)]
*  I think it even had a heartbeat. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2629.32s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2631.1200000000003s)]
*  And before that, an artificial genome. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2632.4s)]
*  I mean, it's coming, Joe, it's coming. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2634.88s)]
*  Scientists grow synthetic embryo with brain and beating heart without eggs or sperm. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2637.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2642.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, and now extrapolate, go from here to a hundred thousand years of technology [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2643.2799999999997s)]
*  as long as we don't blow ourselves up or have a super volcano kill us all. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  Scientists from University of Cambridge have created model embryos from mouse stem cells [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2651.64s)]
*  that form a brain, a beating heart, and the foundations of all other organs of the body. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2657.08s)]
*  So, it's really wild shit. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2662.76s)]
*  Well, it's just a molecular machine, you know, life. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2663.76s)]
*  And once you know the blueprint, you just print it out. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2668.76s)]
*  So, we're getting there. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2672.0s)]
*  It's a hard problem, but you know, it's coming. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2673.0s)]
*  And it may not happen in our lifetime, you know, Ray Kurzweil's The Singularity is Coming [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2675.0s)]
*  2030, 2040, just take it out two centuries, right? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2679.32s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2684.12s)]
*  Something like that is coming. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2685.12s)]
*  And how would it be any different from what our religions describe God as an omnipotent being? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2687.2000000000003s)]
*  Right, especially if you go a million years from now, a million years of evolution, we [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2693.2000000000003s)]
*  conceivably would have the power of God's. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2697.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's coming. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2699.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2701.4s)]
*  Assuming we live our lives long enough. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2702.4s)]
*  So, if you think of a life form that exists out there, you know, millions of light years [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2704.28s)]
*  away that has achieved this sort of advanced technology, do you think that they would want [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2708.84s)]
*  to be visiting us and be interested in us with our nuclear power and all of our chaos [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2715.28s)]
*  and our territorial behavior and the fact that we have these thermonuclear weapons, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2721.44s)]
*  we're pointing them at each other, and I think they'd be pretty interested. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2727.0400000000004s)]
*  Or in the plot of many of these, like the Day of the Earth's Fiddle, warning us, stop [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2730.48s)]
*  doing this or else. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2735.1200000000003s)]
*  Or intervening. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2737.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, there's been discussions about them hovering over nuclear facilities. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2738.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes, I know about that. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2741.44s)]
*  That may be a selection bias of where the cameras are located or where the monitoring [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2743.3999999999996s)]
*  of that. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2748.56s)]
*  Of course, we have more monitoring around our nuclear sites. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2749.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2751.6s)]
*  Missile sites. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2752.6s)]
*  So, that could just be an artifact of measurement. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2753.6s)]
*  But nevertheless, your larger point, yes, maybe. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2754.68s)]
*  Yes, maybe. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2757.8799999999997s)]
*  Yes, maybe. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2758.8799999999997s)]
*  This is not all- [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2759.8799999999997s)]
*  Got to be skeptical. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2760.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, not in principle just because you're a cynic or a nihilist, not for that reason. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2761.8799999999997s)]
*  The question is, what should we believe? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2770.12s)]
*  Justified true belief. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2773.6s)]
*  What should I believe is true? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2774.6s)]
*  Some things are true, some things are not. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2775.7999999999997s)]
*  I want to believe the correct things. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2777.56s)]
*  How do I know? [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2779.12s)]
*  So this is what science has kind of developed, science and rationality over the centuries. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2780.68s)]
*  Okay, so we know we're biased. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2785.52s)]
*  We know we have to be careful about the confirmation bias and the hindsight bias and so on. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2786.96s)]
*  So we have to set up some kind of system where it's not just me claiming it. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2791.24s)]
*  You can look at it too. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2796.0s)]
*  You can run the experiment. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2797.0s)]
*  Here's how I did it. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2798.0s)]
*  You do it. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2799.0s)]
*  And when that's not done, we have all kinds of problems like the replication crisis in [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2800.92s)]
*  psychology and medical science over the last decade or so. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2803.72s)]
*  Some significant two-digit percentage of these experiments can't be replicated. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2807.76s)]
*  Even though they went through peer-reviewed professional journals and they were done by [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2812.4s)]
*  professional scientists at real universities and so on. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2816.4s)]
*  So it's hard to know what to believe. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2819.88s)]
*  But there's also a problem of basing science on falsified studies, like the Alzheimer's [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2822.84s)]
*  issue that they're dealing with now. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2828.88s)]
*  You know, the whole amyloid plaque thing where they found out that a lot of, like, what is [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2829.88s)]
*  the, I don't want to butcher this because obviously I'm not a scientist, but there's [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2834.96s)]
*  a series of Alzheimer's drugs that were based on research that was falsified. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2840.0s)]
*  And they're finding this out now. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2846.88s)]
*  And this is a terrible thing for people that have invested their health in these medications, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2849.0s)]
*  people that have promoted these medications, that this was all based on falsified data. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2856.3s)]
*  Or how about the... [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2861.1400000000003s)]
*  Find that, because that's pretty fascinating. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2862.1400000000003s)]
*  Because that, here it is, this is a legitimate conspiracy. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2864.42s)]
*  Neuroscience Image Sleuth finds signs of fabrication and scores of Alzheimer's articles threatening [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2868.94s)]
*  a reigning theory of the disease. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2874.42s)]
*  That's terrifying to find out that the people that are responsible for doing these experiments [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2877.26s)]
*  falsified. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2882.5s)]
*  Matthew Schrag, a neuroscientist and physician at Vanderbilt University, got a call that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2883.78s)]
*  would plunge him into a malstorm of possible scientific misconduct. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2888.1000000000004s)]
*  A colleague wanted to connect him with an attorney investigating an experimental drug [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2892.6200000000003s)]
*  for Alzheimer's disease called Simaphilam. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2897.94s)]
*  The drug's developer, Casiva Sciences, claimed it improved cognition, partially by repairing [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2901.84s)]
*  a protein that can block sticky brain deposits of the protein amyloid beta, a hallmark of [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2907.86s)]
*  Alzheimer's. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2913.5s)]
*  The attorney's clients, two prominent neuroscientists who are also short sellers who profit if the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2914.5s)]
*  company's stock falls, believe some research related to Simaphilam may have been fraudulent [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2919.86s)]
*  according to a petition later filed on the behalf of the US Food and Drug Administration. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2926.18s)]
*  So this is a huge scandal in medical science. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2931.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2937.54s)]
*  And this one appears to be more fraud than just error or bias. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2938.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2941.82s)]
*  That's horrible, right? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2943.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2944.1400000000003s)]
*  This is what whistleblowers are for. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2945.1400000000003s)]
*  Often these things are exposed through insiders. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2946.38s)]
*  I mean almost always. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2948.6600000000003s)]
*  It's rare that a journalist from the outside discovers that it's usually a grad student [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2949.6600000000003s)]
*  or something that's suspicious of what the mentor professor is doing. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2952.82s)]
*  So that's a problem. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2957.86s)]
*  So that's why you have to disclose any financial connections you have to companies that might [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2959.6200000000003s)]
*  be affiliated with a drug that could treat the thing you're studying, that sort of thing. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2966.44s)]
*  So there's more pressure to do that. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2971.1000000000004s)]
*  There was another big meta-analysis on SSRIs, the antidepressants, showing big massive meta-analysis. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2973.46s)]
*  50 years we've been prescribing these SSRIs for depression and they do no better than [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2979.12s)]
*  nothing or just chance or just talking to friends or whatever. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2985.64s)]
*  Well also that this idea that it's a chemical imbalance of the brain is not based on science. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2989.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2996.8399999999997s)]
*  Well it's based on something but it's probably incorrect science. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=2997.8399999999997s)]
*  Or fraudulent. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't know if it's fraudulent. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3002.7599999999998s)]
*  That's a pretty hefty charge to heave on a scientist. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3004.3199999999997s)]
*  That's the end of their career. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3007.24s)]
*  That's the end of their lives if they get convicted of actual fraud. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3008.24s)]
*  They'll never work again. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3011.48s)]
*  That's different than making errors. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3013.22s)]
*  Well this Alzheimer's thing is certainly based on fraud. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3015.08s)]
*  It looks like it. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3017.3599999999997s)]
*  And it looks like it was successful for decades. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3018.3599999999997s)]
*  Which is terrifying. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3021.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3022.2799999999997s)]
*  Well there's dozens of examples like this from say the last 50 years. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3023.2799999999997s)]
*  But it's still rare and usually scientists that figure it out and then call them out. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3027.48s)]
*  Ultimately. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3032.04s)]
*  I like to think of it that it works reasonably well. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3033.04s)]
*  We find out about the errors, the mistakes. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3038.2400000000002s)]
*  Creationists always used to point out the errors that evolutionary biologists made, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3040.6s)]
*  therefore God did it. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3044.64s)]
*  The theory is not sound. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3046.08s)]
*  But it was always scientists that disclosed that the error was made by another scientist. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3047.68s)]
*  Different scientists. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3052.0s)]
*  There is an incentive to uncover these things. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3055.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3058.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3059.04s)]
*  So now there's a movement afoot to kind of have scientists say ahead of time, post on [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3060.04s)]
*  these websites, this is the experiment I'm going to do. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3067.36s)]
*  Here's exactly what I'm going to do. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3070.92s)]
*  I will report all of the data. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3072.08s)]
*  So then you avoid the file drawer problem where you only publish the successful ones, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3074.4s)]
*  the rest go in the file drawer that are not successful. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3077.64s)]
*  So this, I mean a lot of major journals will not publish replication experiments. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3080.68s)]
*  They're not interested in that. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3085.2799999999997s)]
*  They want cutting edge new research. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3086.2799999999997s)]
*  Well this is a problem because like again, you know, if you have this theory and no one [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3087.64s)]
*  can replicate it but no one wants to publish the non-replication because it's not interesting, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3093.08s)]
*  then you can go down this rabbit hole of an error perpetrating for decades. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3097.3599999999997s)]
*  How can they mitigate these problems? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3103.52s)]
*  Well that would be one way. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3107.56s)]
*  You know, just transparency. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3108.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3109.56s)]
*  So how could they mitigate the issue of a lack of transparency? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3110.56s)]
*  Is it funding? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3114.12s)]
*  Is it promotion of these? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3115.12s)]
*  Okay, so some of the publisher parish pressure leads. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3117.36s)]
*  There's studies on why scientists commit fraud and it's again like conspiracies. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3121.68s)]
*  It's not a big grand thing. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3126.04s)]
*  It's just like wants to get tenure. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3127.04s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3128.7599999999998s)]
*  Just keep his job. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3130.2s)]
*  I remember one of the most interesting podcasts you had with Edward Snowden and you guys were [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3131.92s)]
*  talking about conspiracies and he starts talking. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3136.6s)]
*  Let me tell you how it really works. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3139.32s)]
*  Behind closed doors is just bureaucrats trying to keep their job. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3140.84s)]
*  So they're ramping up the threat of terrorism because if we don't have a threat, then we're [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3144.56s)]
*  going to lose our funding. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3148.48s)]
*  Very narrow. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3150.52s)]
*  I just want to keep our funding for our department and a lot of science works that way. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3151.52s)]
*  Without let's say external private money, you know, there's a massive competition for [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3155.92s)]
*  public government money for research and that leads to these. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  I'll just report the positive ones. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3167.56s)]
*  I'll kind of throw out these data points because they're too extreme and that'll bring my P [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3169.8s)]
*  value level to where I need it. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3175.08s)]
*  It's called P hacking. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3177.04s)]
*  And you know the P value is the probability of it being chance rather than a real effect. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3179.08s)]
*  And it's set at .05 or .01 and maybe you're at .06. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3183.28s)]
*  You go, well I got this outlier data point here. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3186.76s)]
*  So I'm just going to not count that. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3190.12s)]
*  Then all of a sudden now your P value is at .04. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3191.96s)]
*  Oh, I'm in. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3194.12s)]
*  Now I can publish it. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3195.48s)]
*  This used to happen a lot. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3196.72s)]
*  Now there's pressure like no P hacking. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3197.7999999999997s)]
*  P hacking. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3200.3599999999997s)]
*  So it's kind of the shift in norms. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3202.48s)]
*  Like in journalism is kind of going through this now. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3204.7599999999998s)]
*  Where's the fact checkers? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3208.08s)]
*  And the editors of the editors. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3209.7999999999997s)]
*  And the editors' editors should have editors. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3211.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3214.2799999999997s)]
*  Because too much gets published. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3215.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3217.2799999999997s)]
*  It's managing the managers. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3218.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3219.2799999999997s)]
*  Or you know like, just think about like the Kyle Rittenhouse story. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3220.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a bunch like that. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3224.72s)]
*  That it fed a certain narrative. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3225.72s)]
*  So it got published as a certain way. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3227.6s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, you know, weeks later, months later, when they dig into it, it's [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3229.72s)]
*  like, OK, well that was misinterpreted. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3233.48s)]
*  Why did that happen? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3235.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3236.04s)]
*  Or the kitty litter boxes in schools from last week. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3237.04s)]
*  You know, that got spread around as a meme. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3239.7999999999997s)]
*  Because it kind of fit the conservative view of, you know, liberals and their confusion [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3241.72s)]
*  about gender and sex and. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3246.8399999999997s)]
*  But the kitty litter boxes is a weird one. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3249.3199999999997s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3251.52s)]
*  It's more like an urban legend. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3252.52s)]
*  I fed into that. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3253.52s)]
*  And let me, I should probably clarify that a little bit. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3254.52s)]
*  I have a friend and my friend's wife is a school teacher. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3256.24s)]
*  And she told him that there was discussions in the school that a mother wanted to put [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3260.52s)]
*  a litter box in one of the bathrooms. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3266.28s)]
*  He told me this and I talked about it on here. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3269.6s)]
*  And then people were saying, that's not true. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3271.88s)]
*  It's an Internet rumor. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3273.6s)]
*  So I contacted him again and I said, tell me exactly what she said and contact her and [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3275.36s)]
*  find out. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3280.38s)]
*  She no longer works at that school. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3281.38s)]
*  She works for another school. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3282.68s)]
*  She contacted the other school. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3283.92s)]
*  She didn't get a response. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3285.16s)]
*  I don't think they actually did it. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3286.88s)]
*  I think there was discussions about doing it because there was one particularly wacky [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3289.0s)]
*  mother. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3293.36s)]
*  But there is, it doesn't seem that there's any proof that they put a litter box in there. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3294.36s)]
*  The reason why I was interested in it and willing to entertain it was there was about [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3298.2s)]
*  10 years or so ago, we went to, there was a UFC in Pittsburgh. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3303.36s)]
*  And when we went there, as we landed, we were driving from the airport to the hotel. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3308.44s)]
*  We see all these people with mascot outfits on. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3314.56s)]
*  We're like, what is going on? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3317.64s)]
*  And we talked to this guy and he said, there's a furry convention in town. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3319.88s)]
*  And I said, wow, this is crazy. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3323.56s)]
*  So they all decided to get together. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3325.96s)]
*  So they were at bars and on the streets and it was like a get together. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3327.28s)]
*  They used to do it in San Diego, but at the time San Diego was a little bit more conservative [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3330.96s)]
*  and they were having a hard time doing it. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3335.38s)]
*  So they moved it to Pittsburgh and this was the year they moved it to Pittsburgh. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3336.88s)]
*  This is according to him. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3339.88s)]
*  So we check into the hotel, the hotel, the guy was working the front desk was saying [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3341.04s)]
*  how crazy it was. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3346.12s)]
*  These folks were asking for their food to be delivered in bowls on the ground so they [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3347.7200000000003s)]
*  could eat it like animals. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3352.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm like, that is crazy. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3353.6400000000003s)]
*  And then he said, they asked for a litter box in the lobby. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3355.6400000000003s)]
*  Now they didn't put a litter box into the lobby, but someone, according to this man, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3361.36s)]
*  asked him for a litter box. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3366.92s)]
*  I'm like, that is crazy. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3367.92s)]
*  So I went and did a deep dive online. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3370.04s)]
*  I went to forums where furries go, because I was trying to find like, is this a thing? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3373.32s)]
*  Do they like to use litter boxes? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3378.04s)]
*  Out of all of my searching, I could only find one poster, one guy who said he had used a [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3380.2000000000003s)]
*  litter box. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3386.56s)]
*  So this one person who was saying that he thought it was kinky and he'd like to use [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3388.44s)]
*  it, he, they, it, them, whatever, like to use a litter box. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3393.16s)]
*  So that was all I could find. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3398.0s)]
*  So is that something that people do or is it something that people talk about doing [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3400.16s)]
*  because it's fun? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3405.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3406.7599999999998s)]
*  But one of the things that I found about these furries is like, it's sexual in some sort [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3407.8399999999997s)]
*  of weird way. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3412.8799999999997s)]
*  They like to get together and have sex with their furry outfits on. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3415.0s)]
*  They don't want people to know who they are or what they want to keep the outfits on. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3421.08s)]
*  So it's a cosplay kind of thing. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3426.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a cosplay kink thing that some people engage in. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3427.2s)]
*  How that got connected to gender, I do not understand because it seems to be a completely [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3431.0s)]
*  different sort of kink. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3436.4s)]
*  But what I think people have concern with is that it's nonsense and that it's crazy. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3438.32s)]
*  And if this nonsense starts getting into schools, because there are, Jamie, what was the thing [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3442.68s)]
*  that you were telling me? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3448.2s)]
*  Someone was telling you about one kid thinks they're a wolf. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3449.64s)]
*  I honestly don't know. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3453.3599999999997s)]
*  I still need to, I think they're trolling. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3455.3199999999997s)]
*  I think there's something that happened on TikTok. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3458.3599999999997s)]
*  I got out of hand. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3460.3599999999997s)]
*  In that film, what is a woman? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3462.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, there was that one person that said that they're a wolf. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3463.68s)]
*  You can always find somebody. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3467.56s)]
*  There is a report from ABC though where they went and talked to a bunch of younger kids [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3468.56s)]
*  and parents that were having a meeting and they're like, our kids like to dress up and [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3472.08s)]
*  talk this way. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3475.3999999999996s)]
*  But you should see how different they are when they do it. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3476.3999999999996s)]
*  They went from being very reserved to outgoing. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3478.6s)]
*  Right, because it allows them to, when they pretend that they're a wolf, they can just [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3481.16s)]
*  be freer. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3486.6s)]
*  So maybe they're very shy, introverted kids, and this allows them some form of escapism. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3487.6s)]
*  Like you said, like a cosplay type thing. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3495.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so what happens then is, so there's an element of truth to the, and this is true [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3497.7599999999998s)]
*  with conspiracy theories, always a little element of truth and then it gets blown up [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3502.24s)]
*  into something else. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3506.2s)]
*  And then if it gets politicized, oh, that's just the sort of thing those libtards would [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3507.2s)]
*  do in these schools, they're trying to groom our children. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3510.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3513.16s)]
*  Then you get a moral panic. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3514.16s)]
*  It's like the satanic panic of the 1980s. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3515.16s)]
*  Started with that McMartin preschool case in Manhattan Beach. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3518.04s)]
*  Yes, we'll talk about that because that's pretty crazy. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3521.12s)]
*  Totally crazy. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3523.72s)]
*  So this was kind of in the time in psychology where Freudianism, sort of unconscious memories [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3524.72s)]
*  of things and so on were becoming popular. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3531.98s)]
*  And there was this idea that there's a lot of molestation and secret satanic cults all [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3536.48s)]
*  over America. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3543.04s)]
*  And there's a lot of these kinds of preschools. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3544.84s)]
*  So the McMartin preschool case was based on children telling these fantastic stories about [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3546.8s)]
*  the stuff that was going on at the day school. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3553.76s)]
*  Now you have kids, I have kids. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3555.56s)]
*  It's like how, this is impossible for parents not to know this. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3557.04s)]
*  They have tunnels, underground tunnels where they have horses. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3560.64s)]
*  They take them out to Catalina and they do these satanic things to them. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3562.94s)]
*  And what, the parents, no one noticed this? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3566.38s)]
*  And they were kind of coaching the kids when they were asking the kids these questions. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3568.5s)]
*  What did they do? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3573.14s)]
*  Did they do this? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3574.14s)]
*  And the kids are like, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3575.2200000000003s)]
*  Remember the anatomically correct dolls? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3576.58s)]
*  Now show me where he touched you. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3578.94s)]
*  And worse, they separate the kids from their parents, the mom's outside and the little [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3581.82s)]
*  kid's scared to death in this room. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3586.94s)]
*  And then he's like, okay, he touched me there, can I go back to my mommy now? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3589.02s)]
*  And then this ruined people's lives and careers and these people were accused of these horrible [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3592.7s)]
*  things that turns out they did not do. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3597.2599999999998s)]
*  They didn't do it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3599.7s)]
*  Before the OJ trial, this was the longest and most expensive trial in California history, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3600.7s)]
*  that McMartin preschool case. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3603.8999999999996s)]
*  But it launched this kind of satanic panic around America. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3604.98s)]
*  There's one of these cults in every city. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3607.8199999999997s)]
*  And finally the FBI got involved and said, all right, we better look into this. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3609.46s)]
*  And they found nothing. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3612.8999999999996s)]
*  Okay, you can always find some weirdo who's a Satanist, right? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3614.3399999999997s)]
*  And maybe they do some weird things with a cat or something. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3619.14s)]
*  Or a cat gets mutilated by a dog. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3621.94s)]
*  And then you got the Satanist, he's over there. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3624.1400000000003s)]
*  And then the mutilated cat was found over there. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3626.38s)]
*  There must be some connection. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3628.42s)]
*  And before you know it, you get this spiraling moral panic. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3629.42s)]
*  And it was similar to the recovered memory movement in the 90s. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3633.42s)]
*  When we started in 92, we started covering this because it was the same kind of thing [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3636.76s)]
*  where these were adult, mostly women, going into therapy for various issues, sleep problems, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3640.34s)]
*  depression, weight issues, whatever. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3646.1000000000004s)]
*  The therapist who had bought in all this Freudian stuff that you suppress, you suppress your [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3648.98s)]
*  memories. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3654.3s)]
*  And we can get them out as if memory is like a video recording. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3655.7400000000002s)]
*  And you can watch it on the little Cartesian theater of your mind as if there's little [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3660.26s)]
*  homunculus in there looking at the screen. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3664.54s)]
*  Okay, play it back for me. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3666.54s)]
*  What's your father? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3667.98s)]
*  They don't start off like that. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3668.98s)]
*  They just go, okay, so what are your issues? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3670.26s)]
*  And the client says what the issues are. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3672.26s)]
*  Well, some people that have those symptoms were molested when they were children. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3675.18s)]
*  Well, no, that didn't happen to me. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3678.82s)]
*  Well, I know you don't think it happened to you. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3680.82s)]
*  But in fact, we know about repressed memories that you repress the memory of that trauma [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3683.38s)]
*  because it's so traumatic. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3687.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3688.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3689.62s)]
*  How do I know? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3690.62s)]
*  Okay, have you ever had a dream or ever had fleeting thoughts about this, this, and this? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3691.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think I might have. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3694.94s)]
*  So six months later, now the person thinks, I think this actually happened to me. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3696.66s)]
*  And then there's this big moment of confrontation with the father, grandfather, uncle, whoever [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3700.98s)]
*  it is. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3704.5s)]
*  And, you know, of course, they're just in a state of shock like this. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3705.5s)]
*  This is horrible. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3708.78s)]
*  And then it got worse where they were actually tried, put on trial for and some of these [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3710.02s)]
*  guys were convicted based on nothing other than one of these recovered memories. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3714.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's a real issue with hypnotic regression, right? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3718.1s)]
*  You can introduce thoughts into people's minds. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3721.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, that was an issue with John Mack's work. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3723.5s)]
*  You aware of John Mack? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3727.1800000000003s)]
*  John Mack, who was a psychologist out of Harvard, he wrote a book called, it was called [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3729.34s)]
*  Abduction, I believe it was. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3734.02s)]
*  Abducted. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3735.02s)]
*  Abducted. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3736.02s)]
*  And it was all about UFO abductees. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3737.02s)]
*  And it was a similar situation where they were using hypnotic regression. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3740.38s)]
*  And the problem was the way the questions were formulated and the way these hypnotic [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3744.52s)]
*  regression sessions were conducted, a lot of people thought was extremely unscientific [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3749.7400000000002s)]
*  and in fact could have introduced these ideas. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3755.1400000000003s)]
*  Because one of the things was like, oh, this is a uniform tale that everyone keeps telling. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3758.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, well, do you have the same person asking these people these questions? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3762.62s)]
*  And how are they doing this? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3766.1600000000003s)]
*  And do they have a vested interest, like perhaps maybe they're publishing a book? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3767.7400000000002s)]
*  They have a vested interest in trying to make this a narrative. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3772.1800000000003s)]
*  And it turns out, yeah, that seems to be the case. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3775.7000000000003s)]
*  They were asking these people these very leading questions and taking them through these hypnotic [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3779.02s)]
*  regression sessions. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3783.74s)]
*  And they were all convinced that they were abducted by aliens. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3785.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the pioneering researcher on this, Elizabeth Loftus, a psychologist studies memory, she [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3789.06s)]
*  made famous these studies of where you show people like a video of a car accident. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3794.68s)]
*  And you ask one group, how fast would you estimate the cars are traveling when they [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3800.54s)]
*  collided? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3803.74s)]
*  Second group, how fast would you estimate the cars are traveling when they smashed into [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3804.74s)]
*  each other? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3807.9399999999996s)]
*  The latter one gets a higher estimated speed. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3808.9399999999996s)]
*  Or you show subjects a little 30 second video clip of somebody sitting on a park bench and [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3812.22s)]
*  some guy walks up and grabs your purse and runs off. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3817.9399999999996s)]
*  What color was his hat? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3821.62s)]
*  Oh, it was a blue hat, it was a baseball hat, it was a knit cap, and so on. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3823.02s)]
*  The guy wasn't wearing a hat at all. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3826.3799999999997s)]
*  Just asking the question. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3829.2599999999998s)]
*  Now the memory is corrupted. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3832.14s)]
*  Now the person thinks the person had a hat. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3834.5s)]
*  That's the new memory, right? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3836.4599999999996s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3837.74s)]
*  Her most famous research was on the lost in a mall. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3838.74s)]
*  So these are adult subjects who had been screened and they know that when they were children [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3841.2599999999998s)]
*  they were never lost in a mall, right? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3847.02s)]
*  But they introduced amongst many things that they were talking about. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3848.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you remember the time when you were five, because your parents told us about this, when [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3851.14s)]
*  you were lost in the mall? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3855.06s)]
*  Oh yes, oh my god, it was terrible. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3856.8599999999997s)]
*  I was so scared and then I remember hearing the voice of my mom and then this guy helped [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3858.8999999999996s)]
*  me and he was wearing this flannel shirt and he took me to my mommy and so on and so on. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3863.8599999999997s)]
*  They just make up this complete, it never happened. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3867.54s)]
*  She just made that up on the spot. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3870.18s)]
*  So we have this little internal storyteller to try to make sense of this chaotic world. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3872.58s)]
*  And so the moment you get new information you've got to try to fit it somewhere in there. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3876.3799999999997s)]
*  What's the narrative? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3879.7s)]
*  How does this fit with my life? [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3880.7s)]
*  Well this goes back to what we were talking about with chaotic events and eyewitness testimony. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3882.1s)]
*  It's always screwed up. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3887.18s)]
*  Not reliable. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3888.98s)]
*  Not reliable at all. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3889.98s)]
*  No. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3890.98s)]
*  No, and so what do we do about it? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3891.98s)]
*  Because in the criminal justice system, back to our signal detection problem, right? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3894.02s)]
*  The guy sitting there, is he guilty? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3898.9s)]
*  If he's really guilty and you find him guilty then that's good, that's a hit, right? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3900.34s)]
*  But if he's really innocent and you find him guilty, that's really bad, right? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3904.4s)]
*  So we have this kind of, it's called the Blackstone ratio of 10 to 1. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3908.38s)]
*  Better 10 guilty people go free than that one innocent person be found guilty. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3912.42s)]
*  And so the criminal justice system has the same problem. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3917.56s)]
*  Before DNA and some of that forensic evidence, it was all eyewitness and it's terrible. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3920.7400000000002s)]
*  The Innocence Project has, as you know, exonerated, I don't know, 300 and something people, many [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3926.22s)]
*  of them on death row for crimes they never committed. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3931.02s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3934.62s)]
*  Even like forensic stuff you see on CSI, the bite marks or the hair analysis or the fabric, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3936.02s)]
*  even that's not very well tested and replicated. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3943.42s)]
*  No. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3946.74s)]
*  In fact, Josh Dubin, who worked with the Innocence Project, talked about that. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3947.74s)]
*  He has a podcast on junk science and particularly discuss bite marks about how you can tell [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3951.7s)]
*  people that it was a bite mark from a specific individual and they'll go with it. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3958.74s)]
*  And then you can show them that that absolutely is not the case. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3962.98s)]
*  And you know, this is not like, it's not like DNA evidence. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3966.3799999999997s)]
*  It's not like something that is absolutely 100% true. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3971.3799999999997s)]
*  Even the polygraph, there's a reason it's not allowed in. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3975.7s)]
*  Oh, the polygraph's horse shit. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3978.1s)]
*  Total horse shit. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3979.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's horse shit. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3980.66s)]
*  When someone tells you they passed a lie detector test, like congratulations, you're a sociopath. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3982.62s)]
*  That's right. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3986.1s)]
*  It doesn't fucking mean anything. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3987.1s)]
*  If you believe it, you're not going to give up the case. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3988.1s)]
*  Also, like you have to have a very specific response to like this question and everyone's [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3990.94s)]
*  response to stimuli and stress, they vary. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3996.2599999999998s)]
*  Some people are going to react in a certain way, but that's not indicative of evidence. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=3999.94s)]
*  Like you can absolutely prove. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4004.8599999999997s)]
*  Also like, there was a woman who was convicted, I believe in India, from FMRI data of a murder [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4006.46s)]
*  because she had knowledge of the crime scene. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4016.7400000000002s)]
*  And so like I discussed this with a neuroscientist in America and she was like, that is absolutely [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4020.58s)]
*  not evidence that that person committed the crime. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4026.5s)]
*  But if you are in a trial and you have knowledge of the crime scene because they've told you, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4030.2200000000003s)]
*  this is the case, this is what they're saying happened. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4036.5s)]
*  And then they use this FMRI data to show that you have knowledge of the crime. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4039.3s)]
*  Well, of course you have knowledge of the crime. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4043.1800000000003s)]
*  You're about to go to fucking jail for something you didn't do. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4045.14s)]
*  And they're telling you, you know, it was Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4047.3s)]
*  Like, oh, look, through MRI data, we can show she knows about Colonel Mustard. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4052.46s)]
*  So I believe this woman was actually convicted. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4057.38s)]
*  There are people, neuroscientists, trying to figure out how to use MRIs to see if you can [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4060.46s)]
*  see if somebody's lying. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4065.66s)]
*  I think we're a long ways from that. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4066.66s)]
*  Long ways. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4068.46s)]
*  And I did a TV show once, I don't know, 20 years ago for Fox Family exploring the unknown. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4069.46s)]
*  We did an episode on the polygraph. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4074.2999999999997s)]
*  So we found this guy, Doug Smith, who was now working. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4076.2999999999997s)]
*  He's a former cop in Dallas and he was working with defense attorneys showing why the polygraph [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4078.66s)]
*  is bullshit. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4084.02s)]
*  So he had the funniest story where he said first day on the job, he got the training [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4085.02s)]
*  on how to do the polygraph. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4087.8599999999997s)]
*  So his first day, his boss says, OK, we got the accused in there. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4089.5s)]
*  We think he's the perpetrator. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4094.7s)]
*  Go in there and do the polygraph test. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4095.7s)]
*  So he does the thing. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4097.66s)]
*  He comes back. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4098.66s)]
*  Well, boss, I think he's lying. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4099.66s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, we know he's lying. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4101.26s)]
*  They're all lying. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4103.3s)]
*  Get in there and get the confession. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4104.3s)]
*  He's like, what? [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4105.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4106.3s)]
*  Tell him we know he's lying and tell him we got his fingerprints, too. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4107.3s)]
*  You mean you just, yeah. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4112.0199999999995s)]
*  It's like, oh my God. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4113.0199999999995s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4114.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4115.0199999999995s)]
*  So now, so he gave up because he thought, oh, you mean this is like planting evidence [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4116.0199999999995s)]
*  in a way. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4120.98s)]
*  It is in a way, right? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4121.98s)]
*  This is my type specimen for what I call proxy conspiracists. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4123.5s)]
*  That is, conspiracies. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4127.42s)]
*  That is, they're a stand in for something else. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4128.42s)]
*  The OJ case. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4131.38s)]
*  OJ was acquitted based on a conspiracy theory that the LAPD planted the bloody glove and [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4132.38s)]
*  the blood splatter and so forth. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4137.14s)]
*  And the jury accepted it. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4139.42s)]
*  Now, you know, the evidence is pretty overwhelming. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4140.78s)]
*  He killed his wife and her friend. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4143.1s)]
*  And there was no police tampering. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4145.3s)]
*  There was the one guy, Furman, who was probably a racist, but it wasn't clear that he did [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4147.9s)]
*  anything. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4151.74s)]
*  My explanation is that in a way, the jury said, yeah, maybe not this time, but the LAPD [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4153.3s)]
*  have done these sorts of things. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4159.780000000001s)]
*  And there's this great ESPN documentary series called OJ in America. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4161.740000000001s)]
*  And it's like six hours long, and it tracks the history of the African American community [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4165.26s)]
*  post World War II coming to Southern California and how bad the relationships were between [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4170.02s)]
*  the LAPD and the African American community, particularly right in downtown LA. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4175.3s)]
*  And they did plant evidence. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4179.8s)]
*  They did do things like that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4181.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4182.3s)]
*  So there's an element of truth back to conspiracism. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4183.3s)]
*  I think there's some evidence that Furman did plant some evidence, or if it wasn't for [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4185.5s)]
*  Furman, that there was some evidence that something was planted, whether it was blood [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4189.900000000001s)]
*  splatter or something. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4195.620000000001s)]
*  And they use this excuse that they know he's guilty. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4197.820000000001s)]
*  And so since they know he's guilty, it sort of justifies falsification. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4202.240000000001s)]
*  That was the argument in the 50s and 60s. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4207.18s)]
*  I don't know if this guy did it. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4210.0599999999995s)]
*  He's done something. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4211.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4212.62s)]
*  And if he gets off, he's going to commit another crime. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4213.62s)]
*  So we're doing the justice thing here by planting evidence. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4215.94s)]
*  So enough of that has happened that it's reasonable for African Americans to be suspicious. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4219.62s)]
*  Same thing with their higher rates of vaccine hesitancy now, recently anyway, because of [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4224.8s)]
*  the Tuskegee experiments. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4231.7s)]
*  Our government did do these things, right? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4234.78s)]
*  Syphilis patients that were not treated when they could have been, without their consent, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4236.82s)]
*  without their knowledge. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4240.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4241.98s)]
*  I mean, it's Nazi-like experiments. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4242.98s)]
*  Let's see what happens if we don't treat them. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4244.179999999999s)]
*  And it went on for decades. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4246.22s)]
*  It went on for decades. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4247.22s)]
*  Terrifying stuff. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4248.22s)]
*  Most of them died. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4249.22s)]
*  Their spouses got syphilis. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4250.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4251.22s)]
*  Their children, some of them got, you know, it's terrible. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4252.22s)]
*  And it's the kind of thing that Nazi doctors were doing. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4253.62s)]
*  And you know about Operation Paperclip, right? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4258.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4260.0199999999995s)]
*  Because you had Annie Jacobson on the show. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4261.0199999999995s)]
*  She's really good on these things. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4262.46s)]
*  Her books are just first-class good journalism on that, where she tracked down. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4264.34s)]
*  If you put a paperclip on the file, it means we're going to adopt this guy as one of our [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4268.620000000001s)]
*  scientists before the Russians. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4272.660000000001s)]
*  These are German scientists, before the Russians get them, right? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4274.620000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4277.06s)]
*  And a lot of these guys were doing chemical warfare experiments, biological warfare experiments, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4278.06s)]
*  and of course, Werner von Braun with the V-2 rockets, the most famous of the paperclip [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4283.22s)]
*  experiments. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4286.620000000001s)]
*  So, enough of that goes on. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4287.620000000001s)]
*  It's like, wait a minute. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4289.02s)]
*  On the one hand, we're trying these guys at the Nuremberg trials and executing them [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4290.3s)]
*  for war crimes. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4294.62s)]
*  And then we have these other guys that did pretty much the same thing. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4295.62s)]
*  But now they work for us. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4298.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4299.860000000001s)]
*  So, there's enough of that. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4300.860000000001s)]
*  You go, you know what? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4301.860000000001s)]
*  That was a crazy one because they were just justifying it based on, listen, we're in the [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4302.860000000001s)]
*  middle of a Cold War with Russia. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4306.54s)]
*  And if we don't get these people, the Russians are going to get them. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4308.18s)]
*  And yes, they are Nazis, but they're also very advanced scientists. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4311.1s)]
*  And they have research that could benefit us and our rocket programs and a lot of other [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4314.860000000001s)]
*  scientific experiments. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4319.34s)]
*  It's pretty wild shit when you find out that it's true. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4320.900000000001s)]
*  The guy who invented sarin gas, the German chemist, and he lived in... [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4323.34s)]
*  Fritz Haber. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4327.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4328.38s)]
*  No, not Fritz Haber. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4329.38s)]
*  No, Fritz Haber was the other gas. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4330.38s)]
*  The other guy. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4331.38s)]
*  Yeah, the other guy. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4332.38s)]
*  Mustard gas. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4333.38s)]
*  He invented that and he also invented the Haber method of extracting nitrogen. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4334.38s)]
*  So they wanted him for crimes against humanity while he was also up for the Nobel Prize for [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4338.26s)]
*  extracting nitrogen from the atmosphere. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4342.42s)]
*  Same thing with Linus Pauling, you know, was one of the great scientists of all time, won [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4345.98s)]
*  two Nobel Prizes, one for peace, one for chemistry. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4350.299999999999s)]
*  And he was spied on by the FBI and he was not allowed to go. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4353.82s)]
*  Well, he was allowed to go collect his one Nobel Prize, but he couldn't go to some conferences [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4358.54s)]
*  because they thought he might be a communist and all this stuff because he was anti-nuclear [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4363.34s)]
*  war. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4367.54s)]
*  That was during the Red Scare. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4368.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4369.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4370.54s)]
*  During the 50s, right? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4371.54s)]
*  So again, you think, wait a minute, our government was doing this? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4372.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4374.54s)]
*  Well, maybe I should be suspicious about current stuff, right? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4376.26s)]
*  Well, that's also the MK Ultra experiments. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4379.58s)]
*  You know, there's so many people that were involved in that that like one of them was [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4383.26s)]
*  Ted Kaczynski. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4387.3s)]
*  He was involved in the Harvard LSD experiments and wound up being a horrible murderer. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4388.3s)]
*  Who knows what they did to his fucking brain while they were dosing him up with LSD and [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4394.42s)]
*  running these abusive studies on him. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4399.42s)]
*  Has that been confirmed by his brother? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4401.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4402.94s)]
*  They did not only did that, they well, he had a horrible background. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4404.339999999999s)]
*  I thought it was schizophrenic. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4407.86s)]
*  That too. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4410.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4411.099999999999s)]
*  Well, when he was a child, he had some sort of an ailment where they took him from his [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4412.099999999999s)]
*  parents and they put him in an orphanage or some sort of a children's hospital where when [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4417.179999999999s)]
*  he was a baby, he had no contact with human beings. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4423.9s)]
*  He would just cry in his crib. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4426.98s)]
*  They would feed him and that's it. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4428.9s)]
*  This went on for months and they think that just that development really fucked up his [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4430.82s)]
*  brain. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4435.7s)]
*  And then on top of that, he goes to Harvard and he's involved in the LSD experiments and [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4436.7s)]
*  apparently those experiments were very abusive because they were studying like what would [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4440.62s)]
*  happen if you give these people LSD and you emotionally and psychologically abuse them. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4444.26s)]
*  And you know, he had, according to his brother, all sorts of real problems with relationships [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4450.26s)]
*  and other human beings, like a real, just a really damaged human being overall. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4454.98s)]
*  Did you see Earl Morris's film Wormwood about the Frank Olson case? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4461.299999999999s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4465.66s)]
*  I heard about it, but I didn't see it. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4466.66s)]
*  It's quite good. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4467.66s)]
*  It's a little long. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4468.66s)]
*  Netflix is cranking out these really long documentary series. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4469.66s)]
*  You know how to drag you in and keep you there. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4471.98s)]
*  I'm two hours in and I still have no idea what's going to come on. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4474.299999999999s)]
*  I get to the point. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4477.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4478.9s)]
*  So this was Frank Olson's one of the chemists that worked in the MKUltra program, but they [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4479.9s)]
*  dosed him. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4484.66s)]
*  He's just at some bar and some club with the other CIA guys and they said, hey, let's put [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4485.66s)]
*  some LSD. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4491.7s)]
*  And then like 10 days later, he jumps out of a New York City high-rise window, or did [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4492.7s)]
*  he? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4499.66s)]
*  And there was evidence that there was a couple of CIA guys that were there. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4500.66s)]
*  Maybe they pushed him. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4504.82s)]
*  And then his son, Eric Olson, who's been kind of keeping the story alive, this happened [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4505.82s)]
*  You know, had the body exhumed and there was evidence of like a blow to the head, like [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4510.86s)]
*  a crack in the skull. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4517.299999999999s)]
*  They hit him first and then shoved him out the window. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4519.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4521.54s)]
*  But maybe he hit his head. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4522.54s)]
*  And Seymour Hirsch was the journalist that kind of tried to track this down. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4526.66s)]
*  And they couldn't quite get the CIA to admit. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4530.42s)]
*  The CIA paid him off. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4533.339999999999s)]
*  They gave him, I think, $750,000. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4534.339999999999s)]
*  But they said, but no guilt. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4537.339999999999s)]
*  We're not going to say we did anything. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4538.38s)]
*  This is the problem with conspiracies, right? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4540.9400000000005s)]
*  That some of them are real. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4543.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4545.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4546.46s)]
*  And so when you have someone like Alex Jones, when he was on your show and I show a clip [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4547.46s)]
*  of this to my class actually last night, you know, where he's ranting on about NASA has [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4551.9400000000005s)]
*  this headquarters in San Francisco where they're dosing people to talk to the aliens. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4556.78s)]
*  And he goes off on something, right? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4561.54s)]
*  That the CIA was dosing people with hallucinogenic drugs. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4564.3s)]
*  That's true. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4568.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4569.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4570.66s)]
*  So this is the problem with conspiracy theories is they start off with some element of truth. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4571.66s)]
*  Yeah, there's some facts there. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4575.86s)]
*  OK. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4577.74s)]
*  And talking to Megyn Kelly about this, because she went to, she came here to Austin, met [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4578.74s)]
*  with Alex, did a whole show when she was with NBC on Alex Jones. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4582.86s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4586.54s)]
*  And then she got a lot of heat for talking to him and letting him speak, as you did. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4587.54s)]
*  And she said, you know, she has a team of fact checkers at NBC. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4591.58s)]
*  They go, OK, let's just fact check everything he said. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4594.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's like, you know what? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4597.42s)]
*  Pretty much everything he said starts off with some little thing. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4598.42s)]
*  Well, that's actually true. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4600.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4602.0199999999995s)]
*  And then he spins it off into something else. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4603.0199999999995s)]
*  And this is the problem with conspiracies. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4604.54s)]
*  Well, it's also the problem with like, if you're going to find all these different conspiracies, [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4606.0199999999995s)]
*  how much time do you have? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4611.58s)]
*  How much time do you have to investigate all of these in a very thorough manner? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4613.1s)]
*  There's almost impossible. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4618.42s)]
*  It's almost impossible to get to the bottom of every single one of those and have an objective [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4620.34s)]
*  analysis of the facts. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4626.58s)]
*  Like where I was talking about Tom O'Neill, the book Chaos, where he covered Manson. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4628.9400000000005s)]
*  He wrote that book for 20 years, 20 years on one case. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4633.04s)]
*  He started off, he was hired to do a article. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4637.96s)]
*  I forget what magazine it was for, but whatever publication it was for, it was the anniversary [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4642.58s)]
*  of the Manson case. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4647.360000000001s)]
*  So he was just supposed to do this little thing about the case. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4648.679999999999s)]
*  And so as he's a really good journalist, and as he goes into this story, he keeps uncovering [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4653.0199999999995s)]
*  more and more evidence of fuckery, more and more evidence of just a bunch of weird shit, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4659.219999999999s)]
*  and becomes obsessed. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4665.0s)]
*  It takes him 20 years to eventually publish that book. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4666.0s)]
*  And the book is phenomenal. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4670.0s)]
*  I can't recommend it enough. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4672.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4673.679999999999s)]
*  Tom O'Neill is a really good journalist, and the book Chaos is riveting. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4674.72s)]
*  I mean even this, that's already long enough, right? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4678.4800000000005s)]
*  And I just barely touched the surface. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4681.68s)]
*  I like how you connect by giving the word conspiracies. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4682.96s)]
*  It also has CIA and S-O-R-O-S Soros. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4686.360000000001s)]
*  It's all in there. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4692.5s)]
*  Well, when you talk to schizophrenics, and they make those maps of all the connections [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4693.5s)]
*  that people, this person met that person who met that person, who met this person who was [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4698.88s)]
*  in the same airport as that person in 1969, so therefore they're involved with this, that, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4703.12s)]
*  and the other thing. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4708.12s)]
*  It's like... [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4709.12s)]
*  Well, the JFK for that chapter, that took me a long time to write because again, it's [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4710.12s)]
*  just down the rabbit hole. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4713.88s)]
*  There's thousands of books. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4714.88s)]
*  Even Boliossi's book, I mean, 1400 pages. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4715.88s)]
*  Holy crap, guy. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4719.12s)]
*  Come on. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4720.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4721.12s)]
*  That's a lot. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4722.12s)]
*  And then you get into the... [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4723.12s)]
*  And then remembering it all when you're on page 900. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4724.12s)]
*  What the fuck did he say on page 100? [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4725.12s)]
*  He's gotta go back and... [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4726.12s)]
*  Or the 9-11 truth. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4727.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4728.12s)]
*  And then once you go down there, what do I know about explosive devices and how buildings [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4729.12s)]
*  are demolished? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4733.32s)]
*  You know, someone had a really good point the other day. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4734.32s)]
*  They were talking to me about this person who was involved in construction, and they [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4736.16s)]
*  were saying, let me explain to you construction in New York City. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4740.08s)]
*  When they say that that plane could have never taken down those buildings, he goes, when [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4742.92s)]
*  these people... [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4747.64s)]
*  He goes, and I'm not accusing these people of doing it, but I've seen it with my own [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4748.64s)]
*  eyes when you're supposed to use half-inch steel, if you use quarter-inch steel, it's [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4751.5599999999995s)]
*  a lot less money. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4756.8s)]
*  And then there's a lot of this and a lot of skimping here and a lot of... [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4758.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a lot of corruption. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4762.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4763.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4764.0s)]
*  And he was saying, he goes, you know, they're seeing that in Russia with a lot of the Russian... [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4765.0s)]
*  Someone else was explaining this to me, that a lot of these Russian weapons, they're faulty. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4769.96s)]
*  And one of the reasons why they're faulty is because there's corruption. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4774.320000000001s)]
*  And the people that are responsible for making them are skimming. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4777.6s)]
*  They're taking... [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4780.56s)]
*  You know, you're supposed to spend X amount of money... [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4781.56s)]
*  And so a lot of the shit doesn't even work correctly because of corruption, because there's [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4785.52s)]
*  a bunch of people that are involved that are, you know, they're profiting in an absurd way. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4789.400000000001s)]
*  His point was that the World Trade Center buildings were maybe not up to code. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4795.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4798.8s)]
*  That they weren't made the way they were supposed to be made. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4799.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4801.92s)]
*  Well, they probably weren't designed to be able to withstand a plane hit from two commercial [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4802.92s)]
*  airliners full of gas. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4807.96s)]
*  For sure. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4809.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4810.68s)]
*  I remember visiting this guy who was a doctor, and this is back when you had to get a medical [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4811.88s)]
*  marijuana license in California. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4815.88s)]
*  So he was that kind of doctor. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4818.200000000001s)]
*  I was going to him and he gives me this book, and he was very loony, and he gives me this [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4819.56s)]
*  book saying that the World Trade Center towers were brought down by Tesla energy. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4825.64s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4829.8s)]
*  And he was like, he goes, yeah, there's no way to turn concrete into dust. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4831.84s)]
*  And the way these buildings... [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4835.84s)]
*  I go, but what about if one concrete like smashes? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4837.280000000001s)]
*  Made out of fucking powder that you mix with water, wouldn't it just become dust? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4840.44s)]
*  And so I'm breaking down this argument with this guy in the office while I'm trying to [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4844.759999999999s)]
*  get a license for medical marijuana. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4848.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, I got to get my life together. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4850.16s)]
*  What the fuck kind of conversations am I having? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4852.2s)]
*  Because this guy was imploring me to read this book. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4855.24s)]
*  I'm like, oh boy. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4858.2s)]
*  That it was Tesla technology that they used some sort of a... [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4860.0s)]
*  Some sort of a thing. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4864.04s)]
*  Again, a big event like 9-11, we need a big cause. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4865.04s)]
*  Ooh, Tesla energy. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4867.839999999999s)]
*  That sounds pretty good. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4868.839999999999s)]
*  For Skeptic, we did an issue on that which we commissioned an article from a guy that [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4869.88s)]
*  runs a demolition company. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4876.0s)]
*  This is what he does. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4877.0s)]
*  He brings big buildings down. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4878.0s)]
*  And he said, let me tell you how it's done. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4879.0s)]
*  I mean, you got to go in there, break down all the drywall, get into the support beams, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4880.2s)]
*  wrap them up. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4883.84s)]
*  There's no way this could have happened at the World Trade Center building. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4884.84s)]
*  No one noticed. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4887.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4888.92s)]
*  No one noticed that you're constantly putting these detonators everywhere. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4889.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was the weird argument about Tower 7 too, right? [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4894.4400000000005s)]
*  People were saying, Tower 7, it felt like a controlled demolition. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4898.8s)]
*  And it did. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4902.360000000001s)]
*  It felt like a controlled demolition. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4903.360000000001s)]
*  But if you see the full video of how it went down, the inside of it collapsed long before [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4905.400000000001s)]
*  the whole building collapsed. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4912.76s)]
*  There was evidence that it was falling apart. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4914.16s)]
*  And it burned all day. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4915.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, it burned all day. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4916.72s)]
*  And there was diesel generators in the basement. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4918.12s)]
*  So there's all this diesel fuel that was on fire. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4920.52s)]
*  So you get extraordinary heat that's weakening the entire structure of this building for [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4922.6s)]
*  hours and hours. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4926.4400000000005s)]
*  And there's evidence that it collapsed at the top. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4928.04s)]
*  So everyone's like, oh, the way it fell, it was uniformly. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4930.44s)]
*  Yeah, but it already was falling apart. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4932.84s)]
*  The whole thing was on fire. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4935.68s)]
*  You know what really bothers me about a lot of these is it kind of distracts us from real [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4937.08s)]
*  shenanigans that are probably going on. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4941.84s)]
*  What was the relationship between the United States government and the Saudi government? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4944.28s)]
*  Where was that money? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4948.64s)]
*  Who funded those 9-11 hijackers? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4949.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4951.6s)]
*  Why were the Saudi nationals allowed to leave? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4952.6s)]
*  Leave the next day. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4955.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4956.12s)]
*  Why are we not talking about that? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4957.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4958.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4959.44s)]
*  That's real conspiracies. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4960.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4961.44s)]
*  Same thing again with the JFK paper. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4962.44s)]
*  Why aren't they releasing them? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4964.24s)]
*  I suspect it's because the CIA was up to some other things we don't want other countries [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4965.24s)]
*  to know that we were doing. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4969.84s)]
*  I'm sure there's some of that. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4971.2s)]
*  There's always some of that. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4972.68s)]
*  Right? [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4973.68s)]
*  I mean, that's like that's the way they operate. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4974.68s)]
*  And who knows if that's for our own good or if it's for their good. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4977.04s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason Castro was tagged as maybe one of the assassins because we tried [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4980.08s)]
*  to kill him. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4983.76s)]
*  Multiple times. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4984.76s)]
*  Multiple times. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4985.76s)]
*  Exploding cigars. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4987.400000000001s)]
*  In the seashell conch with a bomb in it where he scuba dives. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4988.400000000001s)]
*  I remember when they started the embargo with Cuba when they wouldn't let you get Cuban [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4992.16s)]
*  goods before they did it, Kennedy famously got boxes and boxes of cigars sent to him. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=4996.76s)]
*  I'm like, you motherfucker. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5003.16s)]
*  You motherfucker. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5005.68s)]
*  Like, I enjoy a cigar as much as the next guy. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5006.68s)]
*  But Jesus Christ. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5008.92s)]
*  It's like Governor Newsom. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5009.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5011.92s)]
*  You got to stay home. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5012.92s)]
*  Rules for thee but not for me. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5013.92s)]
*  You got to stay home. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5014.92s)]
*  But I'm going to this nice, fresh restaurant. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5016.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5017.08s)]
*  But don't worry. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5018.08s)]
*  I'll be outside. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5019.08s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5020.08s)]
*  Or Boris Johnson. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5021.08s)]
*  You know, there was a state trooper that took the photo of him. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5022.08s)]
*  Oh, it was? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5024.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5025.56s)]
*  The state trooper was on detail. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5026.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5027.56s)]
*  They took the photo of him and it was like, you motherfucker. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5028.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5030.56s)]
*  Making everybody wear a mask and you're in there eating at the French laundry. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5031.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5035.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5036.32s)]
*  But that's, you know, but that's always the case with people in power. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5037.32s)]
*  They, you know, they'll come up with things that look good in terms of optics. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5040.32s)]
*  And like, these are the measures that we're going to take and everyone has to abide by [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5044.0s)]
*  them except for me. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5047.88s)]
*  I'm Nancy Pelosi. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5048.88s)]
*  I want to get my hair done. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5049.88s)]
*  Here's another, here's one of my own conspiracy theories. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5052.88s)]
*  When you get elected president, they take you in a back room and they go, okay, here's [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5056.4s)]
*  what's actually going on. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5059.08s)]
*  Well, but I said I was going to close Gitmo. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5060.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5062.64s)]
*  You're not going to do that. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5063.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I guess I can't do that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5064.64s)]
*  I was going to pull the troops out. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5065.64s)]
*  No, we can't pull the troops out. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5066.64s)]
*  What do you think really happens? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5067.64s)]
*  You think they're just lying when they're making their campaign speeches and they have [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5068.64s)]
*  no intention of doing those things? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5072.56s)]
*  I don't think they know because until you're the nominee, until you're the head nominee [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5074.8s)]
*  and it's close, are you allowed to know what's really going on? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5078.72s)]
*  No, no way. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5083.04s)]
*  I mean, I think when Obama won, when he actually won the election, I think that's when they [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5084.04s)]
*  gave him the, whatever they call them, the white papers, the debriefing papers, you know, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5088.400000000001s)]
*  from the National Security Agency and so on. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5092.72s)]
*  And I'm pretty sure it's like he had all this list of stuff. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5095.28s)]
*  This is what I'm going to do. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5098.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5099.08s)]
*  It's like, I can't actually do those things because, all right, so we close Gitmo, then [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5100.08s)]
*  this happens, then this happens. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5103.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5104.6s)]
*  Remember, you want to do, impose the no first, what was it, nuclear weapons, no launch on [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5105.6s)]
*  warning, LOW, no launch on warning because it's too risky. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5112.04s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to do this. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5115.400000000001s)]
*  And then it never happened. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5116.52s)]
*  And I think our NATO allies said, no, no, we have to be, we have to, we want the Russians [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5118.360000000001s)]
*  to think we may just strike at any moment and not just defensively, you know, and no [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5124.04s)]
*  first use. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5129.96s)]
*  No, that was it. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5130.96s)]
*  That was the first, no first use. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5131.96s)]
*  And he didn't do it. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5133.08s)]
*  He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his stance on nuclear weapons and then didn't do that. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5134.08s)]
*  Why? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5138.28s)]
*  And I think because our NATO allies said, uh, uh, uh, uh, this is in the treaty. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5139.28s)]
*  You got to do this. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5143.6s)]
*  If you don't do that, then the Russians are going to do this and so on. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5144.6s)]
*  Back and forth, back and forth. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5146.96s)]
*  Yeah, someone actually should bring that up during presidential debates. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5147.96s)]
*  Like, you have no idea what's going on until you get in there, sir. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5150.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5154.0s)]
*  So why even saying that? [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5155.0s)]
*  And then point to the fact that every single president that's ever said they were going [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5156.0s)]
*  to do all these things once they get in office and they get the information. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5159.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5163.36s)]
*  So here's where I'm conflicted about, you know, I'm a big free speech guy. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5164.36s)]
*  Transparency is key, but I'm sure there are national security secrets that it's probably [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5167.96s)]
*  good we don't know, right? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5172.76s)]
*  For, you know, this is the world we live in. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5174.76s)]
*  We live in a complex and there are bad people. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5176.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5180.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5181.76s)]
*  So my favorite film is, uh, a few good men, you know, Jack Nicholson is schooling Tom [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5182.76s)]
*  Cruz on the stand, you know, son, we live in a world with walls and on those walls are [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5187.44s)]
*  men with guns and you want me on that wall. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5191.679999999999s)]
*  You need me on that wall. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5193.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5195.2s)]
*  You know, and so on. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5196.2s)]
*  It's like, yeah, he's right. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5197.2s)]
*  Actually, he is right. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5198.2s)]
*  And that script was written to kind of make parody the conservative militarist position. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5199.2s)]
*  But in fact, it is correct. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5204.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5206.36s)]
*  It'd be better if we lived in a world without political borders and guns and so on. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5207.36s)]
*  And bad people. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5211.5599999999995s)]
*  And bad people. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5212.5599999999995s)]
*  That's not the world we live in. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5213.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, imagine that they don't exist and operate as if they don't. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5214.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5217.240000000001s)]
*  You put us all in danger. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5218.240000000001s)]
*  And this is what my question for Elon Musk when we, uh, you know, colonize Mars, what [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5219.240000000001s)]
*  are we going to do there? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5224.120000000001s)]
*  What kind of government, what kind of an economy, how many people are you going to have? [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5225.120000000001s)]
*  Do you have to have police? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5227.92s)]
*  Do you have to have laws? [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5229.280000000001s)]
*  You know, cause his attitudes, oh, just minimize laws. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5230.280000000001s)]
*  We're all just going to, you know, just as this direct democracy, everybody votes minimum [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5233.360000000001s)]
*  laws because that's where things get. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5237.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5238.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5239.72s)]
*  If you have 12 people, that probably works. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5240.72s)]
*  But if you have 1200 or 12 million people. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5241.88s)]
*  Do you think earth is going to be the new United States? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5244.56s)]
*  Like the United States was a civilization, or was a country rather that was started because [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5247.2s)]
*  people were fed up with the way things were run in Europe. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5251.08s)]
*  And they said, well, we're going to go over here. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5253.88s)]
*  We're going to declaration of independence and the constitution. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5255.96s)]
*  And we're going to establish this, you know, this land of the free. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5259.2s)]
*  And you know, it worked out pretty well for a long time. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5263.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5265.68s)]
*  And you know, as time goes on, it gets more and more complex and more and more fucked [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5266.68s)]
*  up. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5269.92s)]
*  Is it inevitable that government bureaucracies just grow? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5271.12s)]
*  They just can't not grow and they get more complex and you need more rules and laws and [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5274.56s)]
*  then you need guns and jails and. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5278.4400000000005s)]
*  It seems like it is. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5281.0s)]
*  It's just, I mean, you can have as many checks and balances as you can just to keep the growth [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5282.0s)]
*  in check. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5286.28s)]
*  Not too much. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5287.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5288.28s)]
*  But it seems like if you started with 10 people at Mars and then you had, you know, a thousand [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5289.28s)]
*  and then 10,000 and then a hundred thousand and then a million, you're going to end up [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5292.84s)]
*  with, you know, lawyers. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5296.4400000000005s)]
*  And courts and mediators and police. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5298.96s)]
*  So what's the solution to that? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5302.799999999999s)]
*  How do you mitigate that completely? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5304.759999999999s)]
*  You don't. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5306.28s)]
*  I don't think it's a human nature. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5307.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5308.28s)]
*  We're naturally selfish. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5309.28s)]
*  It's part of our nature and we're avarice and, you know, we're greedy and just that's [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5310.28s)]
*  who we are. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5315.16s)]
*  I wonder if the solution to that is some sort of an integration with technology. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5316.2s)]
*  That's what I wonder if things like Neuralink and these new proposed technologies that will [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5322.139999999999s)]
*  increase the bandwidth of the human mind. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5327.44s)]
*  And I wonder if those, because if those perhaps will come with an ability to read thoughts [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5329.96s)]
*  and minds and communicate telepathically, which is what I think ultimately, you know, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5336.0s)]
*  we talk about the evolution of the human body and, you know, the human animal from, you [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5341.12s)]
*  know, lower primate to what we are today. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5345.4s)]
*  You know, we assume that it's going to be a biological evolution from here on out, but [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5347.5199999999995s)]
*  it might not be. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5351.719999999999s)]
*  It might be symbiotic. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5352.719999999999s)]
*  to some technology, which seems inevitable. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5355.24s)]
*  There's another argument from the SETI people is that if we encounter aliens, they're probably [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5358.4s)]
*  not going to be biological. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5362.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5363.2s)]
*  But they've moved past that. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5364.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5365.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5366.4s)]
*  Well, that's the fear of artificial intelligence, right? [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5367.4s)]
*  The fear of artificial intelligence that has become sentient and it has no use for us. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5369.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5373.32s)]
*  That's an interesting thing. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5374.32s)]
*  Let's think about that for a second, because when you say, well, they, the AA will want [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5375.32s)]
*  to conquer us or want to control us. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5378.76s)]
*  If the sentient is a human emotion, why wouldn't a computer have wants? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5382.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5386.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5387.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, why would it have desires and needs? [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5388.5599999999995s)]
*  And all of those are based on biological needs, like these primate desires that we have to [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5390.44s)]
*  acquire wealth and status and, you know, to have breeding rights and all the things that [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5395.88s)]
*  motivate people, greed and ego, that motivate people to do what they do now. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5401.2s)]
*  The artificial intelligence, unless we program that into it, won't have that. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5405.78s)]
*  If they are sentient, if they're sentient and far more intelligent than us, it seems [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5409.8s)]
*  to me that that would be the thing that they would realize right away is a real problem [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5414.18s)]
*  with the programming. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5417.8s)]
*  Like, why do we have all this nonsense ego and all this, these needs to acquire things [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5418.8s)]
*  and control things? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5424.08s)]
*  Why is that baked in? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5425.08s)]
*  Like, why do we even need to communicate with people? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5426.08s)]
*  If sentience artificial intelligence was really far more intelligent than us, why would it [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5428.76s)]
*  even talk to us? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5433.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5434.400000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't it just exist? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5435.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5436.400000000001s)]
*  And this is my argument for why I don't fear making contact with extraterrestrials. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5437.4s)]
*  This is the argument that we shouldn't try to communicate with them or send signals out [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5441.32s)]
*  because look what happened historically when an advanced civilization came in contact with [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5445.28s)]
*  a less advanced civilization, they enslaved them or genocide or so on. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5450.04s)]
*  But I don't think you could get to the point where you have an interstellar civilization [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5454.0s)]
*  and you have Dyson spheres and you have massive super advanced technology and so on and still [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5458.62s)]
*  be colonial, enslaving people, genocidal maniacs. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5464.74s)]
*  I don't think you could get there with that kind of attitude. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5471.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so either. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5473.82s)]
*  Do you think that the only thing that separates the biological organism from this advanced [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5475.0199999999995s)]
*  creature, the only way to get past that, because everything that evolves biologically evolves [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5482.0199999999995s)]
*  in a state of competition, right? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5487.86s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why it advances and improves its natural selection and there's [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5489.9s)]
*  a lot going on there. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5495.74s)]
*  Would that be the only way that we could get past all of these bizarre human emotions and [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5498.38s)]
*  ego and greed and need is to separate ourselves from biological evolution and become... [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5503.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5510.22s)]
*  In a way, that's what we've been doing, I think, through the last several centuries [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5511.22s)]
*  of moral progress. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5515.3s)]
*  I just take my previous book, The Moral Arch, or Steve Binker's books, talking about the [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5516.3s)]
*  shift in norms of what is acceptable behavior has been massive in the long run, right? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5520.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5526.14s)]
*  I mean, they used to burn cats and slavery and the death penalty and torture and this [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5527.14s)]
*  was common and people just burning witches, burning them as witches. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5532.5s)]
*  This was common and now it's not. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5536.22s)]
*  Why? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5537.74s)]
*  What happened? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5538.74s)]
*  Our nature didn't change. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5539.74s)]
*  There's no biological evolution. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5541.26s)]
*  We just kind of learned to channel our inner, our better angels and kind of suppress our [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5543.22s)]
*  inner demons through not just laws, top-down laws you probably have to have, but we don't [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5549.860000000001s)]
*  really need laws now to prevent slavery from happening. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5557.62s)]
*  I mean, it's just pretty much nobody, no government's going to say, hey, I got this great idea that's [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5560.7s)]
*  enslaved people. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5564.820000000001s)]
*  The norms have shifted and pretty much nobody wants to do that, right? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5566.38s)]
*  That has driven a lot of human progress without having to do the biological evolution or genetic [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5571.099999999999s)]
*  engineering or reprogramming because you don't want to take out somebody's sense of, I don't [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5577.54s)]
*  know, pride and avarice and I want to be successful, I want to make money, I want to be creative, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5582.179999999999s)]
*  I have these drives and there's a dark side to that. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5586.66s)]
*  Maybe you're also a little bit psychopath and you're kind of mean and nasty in your [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5590.78s)]
*  competitiveness. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5595.3s)]
*  But if you take all that away, then what's the motive to do anything? [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5597.3s)]
*  Why would you want anything? [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5600.820000000001s)]
*  Right, why would you? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5602.06s)]
*  I think we're stuck with both, right? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5603.26s)]
*  So we have to engineer it culturally from the bottom up by changing norms. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5606.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that is happening and that's one of the reasons why, you know, when things happen [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5611.74s)]
*  like this sort of social progress movement and social justice movement, the reason why [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5617.02s)]
*  I think that's a good thing is like maybe it goes too far in some ways, but the direction [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5626.62s)]
*  of it, the thought process behind it is making the world a fairer, better place, which I [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5631.0599999999995s)]
*  think is ultimately good and there's going to be like, it's not a perfect thing because [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5637.9s)]
*  humans aren't perfect. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5641.54s)]
*  So it's like there's the waves, the ebbs and the flows. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5642.54s)]
*  There's an overreach and then there's a correction. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5645.1s)]
*  And I think that if you look at Pinker's work and one of the pushbacks on Pinker's work [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5647.34s)]
*  is, you know, Pinker says that the world is safer, it's better in so many ways now that [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5650.46s)]
*  it's ever been before. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5654.74s)]
*  And people will say, what, how can you say this when there's all this crime and injustice [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5655.74s)]
*  and racism and murder and rape and thievery and all this shit that's going on? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5659.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5663.74s)]
*  That's not denial of all the horrors and atrocities that exist currently. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5665.179999999999s)]
*  But if you look at the grand scale of what the world was like during Genghis Khan's reign [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5669.099999999999s)]
*  versus the world is like today, it's far safer than it's ever been before. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5674.34s)]
*  This is the best time to be alive ever. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5678.78s)]
*  Even though things are still relatively fucked up in comparison to utopia. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5681.82s)]
*  Utopia is a terrible goal to have because we're never going to get there. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5688.74s)]
*  And also it gives a perverse calculation that, you know, we can achieve this perfect society [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5691.94s)]
*  in which everybody is happy forever if it weren't for those people right there. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5697.099999999999s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5701.299999999999s)]
*  And that's our enemy. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5702.299999999999s)]
*  We got to get rid of them. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5703.299999999999s)]
*  The Jews, the Catholics, the Mormons, whoever it is. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5704.299999999999s)]
*  The capitalists, everybody, whoever it is. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5706.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, find an enemy, find an other. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5709.179999999999s)]
*  So how about just, so this is what Kevin Kelly calls protopia, not utopia, just make tomorrow [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5712.02s)]
*  just a little bit better than today, just incremental, just a tiny bit and just go two [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5718.5s)]
*  steps up, one back, okay, adjustments, boom, boom, boom. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5722.9s)]
*  And then in a century, you know, things are twice as good as they were. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5725.82s)]
*  Okay, that's good. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5729.34s)]
*  We should be happy with that. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5730.38s)]
*  I think ultimately that is kind of happening. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5731.38s)]
*  It's slower than most people would like because there's an idea of what we would like society [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5733.74s)]
*  to be like and it doesn't fit that yet. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5737.9s)]
*  And so we're angry and frustrated. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5740.66s)]
*  But I think it's a time management issue too. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5743.099999999999s)]
*  You know, the human being is only alive for a hundred years. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5746.139999999999s)]
*  But during that hundred years, think about how much has changed. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5749.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I remember when I was a kid, I was, I guess I was 11 years old. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5751.98s)]
*  We moved to Florida and I moved from San Francisco to Florida. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5758.299999999999s)]
*  And San Francisco, we lived in a gay neighborhood and our neighbors were gay. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5762.759999999999s)]
*  My aunt used to go over there and smoke pot and play bongo drums naked with this gay couple. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5766.72s)]
*  It was like very normal because it was during the Vietnam era and it was just, they were [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5771.64s)]
*  all hippies. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5776.76s)]
*  And we went from there to Florida, which was very regressive in that way. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5778.2s)]
*  And I had this friend, he was Cuban and his dad was very homophobic. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5783.12s)]
*  And his dad was really angry because he was reading the story. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5790.02s)]
*  And I'll never forget it because I was 11. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5792.12s)]
*  And he's like, oh, these gays want to get married. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5793.4800000000005s)]
*  And he was really mad. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5795.8s)]
*  He was throwing this newspaper down the table. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5796.8s)]
*  And I remember thinking, why does he give a fuck if these gay people want to get married? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5798.84s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5803.24s)]
*  Like, how weird is that? [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5804.24s)]
*  Because there's always going to be some parts of our culture that are still regressive. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5807.08s)]
*  But if you compare that then to today, you know, so this was 55, so this is 44 years [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5814.400000000001s)]
*  ago. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5821.74s)]
*  And if you look back from 44 years ago today, well, that's normal for, you know, no one's [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5822.74s)]
*  going to say, if I went over to someone's house and they're like, these gays want to [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5827.66s)]
*  get married. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5830.42s)]
*  Like, what do you give a fuck? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5831.42s)]
*  Almost no one gives a fuck now. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5833.3s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5834.74s)]
*  You know, it's very, you have to be like the hardest right wing Christian fundamentalist [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5835.74s)]
*  to think that gay people shouldn't be allowed to get married now. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5841.82s)]
*  Think how fast that happened. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5844.78s)]
*  Pretty quickly. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5846.219999999999s)]
*  2011, Hillary and Obama both said they were against same sex marriage. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5847.219999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5851.219999999999s)]
*  They had to, they probably didn't think that. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5852.7s)]
*  And now nobody, it's not even a discussion. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5855.7s)]
*  And remember when interracial marriage was a thing? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5857.740000000001s)]
*  Well, me neither, because that was when I was a young child. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5859.9400000000005s)]
*  But 1967 was the Supreme Court loving decision. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5863.46s)]
*  It was illegal before that. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5866.780000000001s)]
*  Well, it was a state's rights thing. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5868.62s)]
*  Many states had it illegal for interracial couples to marry. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5869.9400000000005s)]
*  Astonishing. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5874.860000000001s)]
*  That's, you know, the 60s. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5875.860000000001s)]
*  That's not that long ago. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5877.58s)]
*  And now no one even, pollsters don't even ask anymore. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5879.26s)]
*  So it's relative to the fact that we have such a short lifespan. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5882.26s)]
*  Like the progress is happening rapidly. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5887.139999999999s)]
*  If you look at history, like historically it's rapid. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5890.179999999999s)]
*  But a human being doesn't live very long. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5894.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5895.86s)]
*  You know, so we were frustrated. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5896.86s)]
*  We want these changes. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5897.94s)]
*  We want progress to appear like almost overnight. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5899.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5902.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I was reading a review of this book on witches and what, just one town in New [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5903.0599999999995s)]
*  England and what life was like there. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5907.86s)]
*  And it's just this miserable life where everybody, you know, people are dying and diseases and [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5911.0599999999995s)]
*  the Indians are going to get us and the drought and this winter storm. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5914.86s)]
*  And you know, pretty much life was nasty, brutish and short. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5919.179999999999s)]
*  And there's like, we have no explanation for this. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5923.099999999999s)]
*  It's the witches. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5926.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5927.46s)]
*  Do you know the story behind that? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5928.46s)]
*  What they think the motivation for the witch trials were? [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5930.179999999999s)]
*  Which ones? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5932.82s)]
*  The Salem? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5933.82s)]
*  Urgot poisoning. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5934.82s)]
*  Yes, I know about that. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5935.82s)]
*  That is why, because there's a lot of historical evidence that points to Urgot poisoning and [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5936.82s)]
*  mass hallucinations and chaos. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5940.78s)]
*  There's one from, I believe it was, it was at 1950. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5942.86s)]
*  There was one in France where they had a situation that was similar. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5947.179999999999s)]
*  There was Urgot poisoning where a bunch of people died, in fact, because Urgot is also [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5950.98s)]
*  toxic. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5954.86s)]
*  But in some quantities, it produces these LSD-like effects and they coincide the Salem [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5956.5s)]
*  witch trials. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5963.46s)]
*  And this is controversial, but there seems to be some evidence that points to that, that [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5964.46s)]
*  it coincides it with a late frost and that this late frost produced this fungus on the [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5969.139999999999s)]
*  wheat and the grains and that these grains were likely infected with Urgot. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5975.179999999999s)]
*  And I think they've found evidence of Urgot. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5980.9s)]
*  I have read this. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5983.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it's possible as an element. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5984.0199999999995s)]
*  No human behavior is explained by one thing. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5987.179999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5988.98s)]
*  It doesn't exist in a vacuum. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5989.98s)]
*  So you could have, I could see, like one, say, teenage girl does this and hallucinates [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5990.98s)]
*  and is chattering in voices or whatever. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5995.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5997.419999999999s)]
*  And then after other friends, they start mimicking it. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5998.9s)]
*  It's sort of a social contagion. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=5999.9s)]
*  Like it's fun. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6001.86s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, it's more than fun. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6002.86s)]
*  And then the adults are like, oh, what's going on here? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6004.26s)]
*  Safety. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6006.54s)]
*  And then you have like a half a dozen elements going on there. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6007.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6009.78s)]
*  And in the case of the witch, in a way, the witch craze is a kind of conspiracy theory, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6010.78s)]
*  right? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6015.14s)]
*  Because one thing conspiracy theories do is they offer a causal explanation for chaos [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6016.14s)]
*  and randomness. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6019.26s)]
*  Our brains are not well designed by evolution to understand randomness. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6020.26s)]
*  My examples of this are like the stars in the sky are random, but they look like patterns. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6024.26s)]
*  Or the Apple iPod shuffle feature was introduced in which your songs are fed to you randomly [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6029.34s)]
*  and Apple got complaints. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6036.34s)]
*  It's not random. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6038.38s)]
*  Certain songs are coming up more than others. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6039.38s)]
*  Like that is random. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6040.78s)]
*  So Apple, apparently, I'm told, had to reprogram it and program it so it feels random intuitively, [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6042.42s)]
*  but it's not. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6047.46s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6048.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6049.46s)]
*  So much of life is just randomness. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6050.46s)]
*  Shit happens. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6052.34s)]
*  The bumper sticker. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6053.34s)]
*  Shit happens. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6054.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6055.34s)]
*  But that's uncomfortable. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6056.34s)]
*  There must be something behind it. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6058.3s)]
*  And if you don't have an explanation, no meteorology to explain weather and no germs theory of [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6060.42s)]
*  disease to explain disease and so forth, what have you got, witches? [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6065.3s)]
*  Well if you talked about the satanic craze of the 80s, right? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6070.22s)]
*  So imagine the satanic craze of the 80s and then on top of that, ergot poisoning. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6076.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6081.02s)]
*  Well, oh my God, now you're drowning witches. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6082.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6083.82s)]
*  I think they would drown a lot of witches and they would say that if they drowned them, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6085.299999999999s)]
*  if they lived, clearly they were witches. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6089.139999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6091.259999999999s)]
*  Well no one fucking lived. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6092.259999999999s)]
*  So it was a lot of whoops, well I guess we killed a fucking innocent. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6093.259999999999s)]
*  They just kept killing people thinking that they were witches. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6096.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6099.66s)]
*  And there's a lot of research on this also, accusing people who were marginalized, poor [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6100.66s)]
*  people, women and so on who didn't have any power. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6105.62s)]
*  So the magistrates, people that had power and money that could have lawyers, whatever, [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6109.219999999999s)]
*  they escaped. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6113.259999999999s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6114.7s)]
*  And also there was motivation to accuse people of horrific things and you know, you could [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6115.7s)]
*  use that to take their property. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6120.54s)]
*  Do you know the story of Elizabeth Bathory? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6121.860000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6124.42s)]
*  Elizabeth Bathory is a woman who lived, God I want to say it was like the 1200 or something [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6125.42s)]
*  like that and she was accused of doing these horrible things to other women. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6131.26s)]
*  Like she was accused of being like one of the greatest mass murderers and serial killers [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6135.62s)]
*  that's ever existed and that she would take these beautiful young women and kill them [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6139.820000000001s)]
*  and bathe in their blood and all this. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6144.219999999999s)]
*  And so we told the story and then someone sent me a link to an article that said there's [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6146.82s)]
*  probably something more to that and that really what it was was they were accusing her of [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6152.3s)]
*  these things so that they could imprison her and take her land and that it might have been [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6158.66s)]
*  that. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6166.179999999999s)]
*  She was accused of these horrific atrocities in order to take away her land. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6167.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's some of that kind of practical thing and revenge against people you don't [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6173.9400000000005s)]
*  like. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6178.22s)]
*  Sure. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6179.22s)]
*  And then there's something called preemptive denunciation. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6180.22s)]
*  You denounce people before you get denounced. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6182.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6184.780000000001s)]
*  And that you denouncing somebody means you must not be a witch if you're denouncing them [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6185.780000000001s)]
*  and then you get this kind of competitive denunciation, no you're a witch, no you're [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6188.860000000001s)]
*  a witch. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6191.820000000001s)]
*  Right, right, right. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6192.820000000001s)]
*  Much like the communist show trials, right? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6193.820000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6195.42s)]
*  You denounce your neighbors as communist before they denounce you, or as non-communist, they [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6196.66s)]
*  denounce you. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6201.66s)]
*  So that's the fear during mass hysteria that people are going to turn on each other because [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6202.66s)]
*  they're afraid that someone's going to come after them so they come after you first. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6207.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6210.14s)]
*  I think we're going through that a little bit with cancel culture. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6211.14s)]
*  Sure, for sure, yeah. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6213.26s)]
*  I'm going to get somebody on my campus and they said the wrong, they used the wrong pronoun [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6215.18s)]
*  or the wrong adjective and I'm going to denounce them before I get denounced and make the mistake. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6220.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6224.34s)]
*  I'm going to be social justice warrior so you couldn't possibly think that I've done [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6225.34s)]
*  anything wrong. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6228.900000000001s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6229.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6230.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so you get this thing called pluralistic ignorance or the spiral of silence where everybody [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6231.900000000001s)]
*  thinks everybody else is thinking something when in fact nobody's actually thinking that. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6234.78s)]
*  The classic experiment on this was binge drinking on college campuses. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6238.9800000000005s)]
*  So you ask individual students by themselves, how do you feel about this? [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6242.58s)]
*  I don't really like it, but I know everybody else likes it. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6246.18s)]
*  So everybody thinks that everybody else likes binge drinking, but actually individually they [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6249.1s)]
*  really don't like it. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6253.18s)]
*  But I got to do it because everybody else is doing it, right? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6254.26s)]
*  So this in part explains the kind of sustaining of the Nazi regime. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6256.7s)]
*  Everybody, well, initially Hitler was popular because he stopped the depression and got [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6262.14s)]
*  the economy going again and so on. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6268.54s)]
*  And then he starts escalating and everybody thinks, well, I'm not too happy about this [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6270.54s)]
*  policy and the thing with the Jews, I don't know. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6274.46s)]
*  But everybody else seems to be going along with it. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6277.02s)]
*  And then by the time you get to the point where somebody needs to speak up and say, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6278.88s)]
*  this is wrong, they have concentration camps for those people. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6284.219999999999s)]
*  And they did it in a way that you could see your neighbor being hauled out and think, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6287.58s)]
*  I'm keeping my mouth shut. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6291.66s)]
*  I'm not saying anything. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6293.259999999999s)]
*  So this is what's called a common knowledge problem. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6295.0599999999995s)]
*  If I know that you know that I know something, then together we can kind of both stand up [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6297.219999999999s)]
*  and say, we're putting a stop to this, right? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6302.54s)]
*  It's like the Leah Thomas thing with the swimming thing. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6305.0s)]
*  None of the women competitive swimmers thought this was fair, right? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6307.46s)]
*  It's a guy competing against us. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6312.5s)]
*  Not right. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6313.9s)]
*  But any one of them by themselves that speaks out, they may just get kicked off the team [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6314.9s)]
*  or get punished by their peers or whatever. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6319.219999999999s)]
*  It would really take, how do we reverse this trend we're in? [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6322.0599999999995s)]
*  It would take all of them together saying, we're not going to compete, all of us, if [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6325.139999999999s)]
*  that person comes in here. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6329.42s)]
*  And that's the only way it was. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6331.7s)]
*  So that's a common knowledge problem. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6332.94s)]
*  We all have to know that we know about this to put a stop to that. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6335.179999999999s)]
*  That's an interesting modern example of that, right? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6340.06s)]
*  Because that is the case with when you see someone who's a biological male who competes [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6342.9800000000005s)]
*  against biological females and dominates them. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6347.46s)]
*  When they were as a biological male not doing nearly as well, there's clearly something [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6350.46s)]
*  wrong here. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6356.06s)]
*  And yet these women are called transphobes and they're ostracized and some of them are [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6357.42s)]
*  kicked off teams. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6365.660000000001s)]
*  And it's a horrible situation. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6367.06s)]
*  It's very similar to that. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6368.94s)]
*  Have you seen this video? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6369.94s)]
*  This came out of a male to female trans playing competitive volleyball. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6371.299999999999s)]
*  And she goes up for the spike and just boom! [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6376.099999999999s)]
*  And it hits this girl in the face and she's down and out, concussion. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6379.78s)]
*  And it's like, okay, I support trans rights. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6385.74s)]
*  I don't think people should be discriminated against for whoever they want to identify [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6389.5s)]
*  as or whatever. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6392.54s)]
*  But there's conflicting rights. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6393.78s)]
*  What about women's rights? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6395.54s)]
*  My favorite quote from Thomas Sowell, there are no perfect solutions. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6398.5s)]
*  There's just compromises. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6401.18s)]
*  Yes, trans rights, but women's rights. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6402.18s)]
*  Women's bathrooms, but the guy wants to go, no, no, you can't, no. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6405.5s)]
*  You just can't have everything, right? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6409.94s)]
*  You can't have everything because also you're going to have people that take advantage of [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6412.06s)]
*  the current cultural climate that might be sexual predators. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6416.7s)]
*  There are examples of that. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6420.44s)]
*  It's not a hysteric thing that's happening everywhere, but it has happened. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6422.18s)]
*  But then there are people that are legitimately trans and they probably should be able to [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6427.06s)]
*  use the woman's restroom. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6431.06s)]
*  So how do you, what is the compromise there? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6432.3s)]
*  Well, unisex bathrooms, I guess, they have choices. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6434.46s)]
*  I'm not that worried about the bathroom thing. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6438.38s)]
*  No, I'm not, but it's a weird one. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6440.38s)]
*  The sports thing bothers me because I've been an athlete my whole life and it's obvious [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6441.580000000001s)]
*  why we have women's divisions in sports. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6446.040000000001s)]
*  It just couldn't be more clear. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6448.660000000001s)]
*  We just celebrated Serena Williams' career. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6450.5s)]
*  She'd had no career if there was no women's tennis division. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6453.42s)]
*  And it's like that for most sports. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6458.02s)]
*  Otherwise I'm always curious why there are women's divisions in chess. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6460.1s)]
*  For example, I really don't know why that is the case. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6463.62s)]
*  You know, that's the case with pool as well. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6465.38s)]
*  There's a trans woman who has become a world champion in certain billiards games and people [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6467.9800000000005s)]
*  are confused about that. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6475.86s)]
*  That's a weird one in my opinion because it's not a power-based game, but there's something [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6477.26s)]
*  about testosterone and the understanding of 3D space, that there's some sort of an [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6482.5s)]
*  advantage. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6488.74s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6489.74s)]
*  Pool is a weird one because it's a game that I'm obsessed with and I've always wondered. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6491.54s)]
*  There's only been like a few women who have been very competitive and been able to beat [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6497.3s)]
*  men consistently in competition. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6502.34s)]
*  And a lot of them are lesbians. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6505.46s)]
*  I don't know what that's all about. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6506.46s)]
*  But there's- [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6508.38s)]
*  Well, they have more masculine physiology. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6509.66s)]
*  That's why. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6513.14s)]
*  It's an on-app. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6514.14s)]
*  Just think of two overlapping bell curves. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6515.14s)]
*  Of course there are some women that can beat some men. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6517.26s)]
*  That's not what we're talking about. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6520.7s)]
*  But we're talking about the best of the best. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6521.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6523.02s)]
*  Once you get up to the six standard deviations out, you're a 0.01% top performer. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6524.02s)]
*  One percent is a huge difference at that level. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6528.78s)]
*  Gigantic. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6531.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6532.5s)]
*  It's curious. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6533.5s)]
*  The chess thing is also very curious. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6534.5s)]
*  That was what was fascinating about the Queen's Gambit film. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6536.38s)]
*  The Netflix thing. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6540.9400000000005s)]
*  This woman is just dominating all these men. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6541.9400000000005s)]
*  She has a superior chess mind. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6544.46s)]
*  But in reality, that doesn't really exist very often. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6546.26s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6550.9800000000005s)]
*  Why not? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6551.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6552.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, you've always made the point of MMA fight if it was a trans woman that killed [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6553.9800000000005s)]
*  a woman. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6559.22s)]
*  That probably ended. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6560.86s)]
*  Probably lawsuits would end it. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6561.86s)]
*  I'm for people being able to do that if they want to do that. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6563.9800000000005s)]
*  If it's a woman who's a biological woman who chooses to compete against a trans woman. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6568.54s)]
*  One of the examples that I've used is there's a woman named Jermaine Duran to me who's a [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6574.14s)]
*  multiple time world Muay Thai champion. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6578.06s)]
*  She was a UFC champion. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6579.9400000000005s)]
*  She actually had a boxing match with a man and knocked him out. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6582.02s)]
*  A biological man. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6585.06s)]
*  She's extraordinary. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6586.3s)]
*  She is the 1% of 1% in terms of elite female combat sports athletes. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6588.42s)]
*  I'm in favor of her being able to make that decision to compete against a man. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6594.9800000000005s)]
*  But to force a biological woman to compete against a trans woman in MMA, I think is criminal. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6600.1s)]
*  I think that is crazy. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6605.66s)]
*  To pretend that they're the same thing is crazy. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6607.1s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense to me. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6609.66s)]
*  If there was enough, you could have their own division. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6611.78s)]
*  That would solve it. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6614.78s)]
*  That would solve it. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6615.78s)]
*  That I think is the solution. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6617.86s)]
*  That to me is the only compromise. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6619.7s)]
*  Is there enough? [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6622.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6623.0599999999995s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6624.0599999999995s)]
*  Maybe if you made a division like that. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6625.0599999999995s)]
*  Look, for the longest time they thought there weren't enough women to compete in combat [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6626.219999999999s)]
*  sports to justify a UFC's women's division. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6630.099999999999s)]
*  But now the women's division of MMA is some of the most competitive and exciting. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6633.94s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6637.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6638.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6639.7s)]
*  There's a strawweight division, a flyweight division. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6640.7s)]
*  There's a featherweight division, a bantamweight division. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6643.9s)]
*  There's multiple divisions that are filled with elite female combat sports athletes. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6646.58s)]
*  Some of those fights are fantastic. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6651.26s)]
*  Up until Ronda Rousey came into the UFC, which is not that long ago. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6655.34s)]
*  Was it 10 years ago? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6659.66s)]
*  When they first started having women's MMA fights in the UFC, there was only one division. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6661.5s)]
*  It was 135 pounds. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6666.3s)]
*  That was it. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6667.66s)]
*  You didn't have all these other weight classes. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6668.66s)]
*  Now these other weight classes like flyweight in particular and strawweight, some of the [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6670.34s)]
*  most competitive. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6674.1s)]
*  They have incredible fights. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6675.66s)]
*  I think if you build it, they will come. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6678.5s)]
*  If there are that many trans women, MMA competitors out there, maybe if they developed a division [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6680.38s)]
*  and they had that, maybe you would see a lot of competitors that would enter that and it [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6690.139999999999s)]
*  would become an exciting division. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6694.5s)]
*  But to make them compete against biological females, or excuse me, to make biological [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6696.74s)]
*  against people who identify as female, I think is just insane. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6701.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6706.740000000001s)]
*  So there, I think we're thinking that fairness and justice trumps rights. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6707.740000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6712.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you should have the right, but it should also be fair. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6713.780000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6716.3s)]
*  What's interesting in many sports is women are allowed to compete against men. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6717.3s)]
*  Biological females are allowed to enter into certain wrestling tournaments with biological [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6724.38s)]
*  males. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6730.1s)]
*  They're allowed to. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6731.1s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6732.1s)]
*  But we never allow biological males to compete against biological females. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6733.1s)]
*  We never allow someone who is both biologically male and identifies as male to compete against [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6736.26s)]
*  females in sports. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6741.5s)]
*  You know, in the 1980s, I got into ultra-distance cycling, you know, Race Across America. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6744.9400000000005s)]
*  I did that five times. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6749.06s)]
*  Then in the 90s, I was the race director. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6750.06s)]
*  So we had in 93, 94, 95, I had two women that were competing, Shawna Hogan and Muffy Ritz, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6752.860000000001s)]
*  and they were phenomenal athletes, just really tough as could be. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6758.66s)]
*  This is coast to coast, nonstop. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6763.18s)]
*  Every competitor has a motorhome behind them and so on. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6765.74s)]
*  And it's just the clock never stops. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6768.38s)]
*  And so it's a really ultra-distance. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6769.9s)]
*  And I remember in, I think it was 93 or 94, Shawna led the entire field all the way into [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6772.46s)]
*  Colorado. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6777.42s)]
*  And me and my staff are thinking, maybe we don't need a women's men's division. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6779.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe we are the sport that can, you know, it's all equal. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6784.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6787.46s)]
*  But by the end of the race, it was like a one day, like 26 hour difference between the [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6789.26s)]
*  top man and Shawna. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6793.78s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6795.06s)]
*  And it's like, okay, I think we need, and I also talked to the women about it in off-season [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6796.06s)]
*  conversations. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6800.58s)]
*  It's like, do you want a women's division? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6801.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6803.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6804.82s)]
*  Because they're still, even with ultra-distance, people were making arguments at the time, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6805.82s)]
*  well maybe, you know, women can endure pain better than men, and you know, over the course [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6809.5s)]
*  of 3,000 miles rather than 100 miles, all those differences even out. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6813.14s)]
*  But no, even there, it just wasn't fair to make them compete against the men. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6818.179999999999s)]
*  So we had two divisions. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6826.139999999999s)]
*  And of course we have, like most sports, age divisions. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6827.139999999999s)]
*  You know, I think the first cut is at age 30, 40, 40 plus, 50 plus, 60 plus, and so [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6830.62s)]
*  on, for obvious reasons. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6837.34s)]
*  Biological decay of testosterone and strength, it just goes down. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6839.42s)]
*  So to me, male to female trans post puberty is doping. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6844.34s)]
*  It's like taking testosterone or human growth hormone or EPO or whatever. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6850.1s)]
*  As you know, in cycling, this is a big issue because it makes a difference. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6855.86s)]
*  I mean, I think Lance said it was like a 10% difference. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6859.94s)]
*  If you do the drug cocktail, you do it right, and you have somebody professional that's [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6863.0199999999995s)]
*  coaching you on this. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6866.38s)]
*  That's a huge difference at the top level. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6868.5199999999995s)]
*  It would be the same if you're post puberty. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6871.46s)]
*  So the NCAA had that rule. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6873.46s)]
*  If you go one year of testosterone suppression post puberty, then we're going to count you [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6875.740000000001s)]
*  as a woman. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6880.02s)]
*  But I don't see the evidence for that at all. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6881.240000000001s)]
*  Then the swimming, International Swimming Organization finally said, no, that's not [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6883.360000000001s)]
*  enough because post puberty, the changes have already happened. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6886.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6890.360000000001s)]
*  It took until Leah Thomas started dominating that they made that decision, though. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6891.360000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6895.160000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6896.160000000001s)]
*  When somebody, finally, some of these women and the parents were speaking up like, this [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6897.32s)]
*  is not fair. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6900.68s)]
*  And like the boy pointed to the emperor's has no clothes. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6902.04s)]
*  Finally, everybody goes, yeah, we all see it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6905.639999999999s)]
*  He doesn't have clothes. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6908.36s)]
*  Finally, somebody said something. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6909.36s)]
*  Everybody could see this is not fair. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6910.36s)]
*  Everybody knows it's not fair. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6912.04s)]
*  What is that about human beings though that they don't want to speak out and that we're [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6913.74s)]
*  willing to accept something that we know is not fair because culturally, that's an accepted [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6917.639999999999s)]
*  thing? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6923.599999999999s)]
*  Well, part of it is fear of punishment. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6924.599999999999s)]
*  You punish the outliers, the people who speak out. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6926.88s)]
*  And that's part of it. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6930.92s)]
*  Why are we punishing the outliers when that seems so obvious? [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6931.92s)]
*  OK, that's yeah, that's an interesting question. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6934.92s)]
*  So there might be some complex psychology there where I'm getting this preemptive denunciation [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6937.080000000001s)]
*  and also virtue signaling. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6942.8s)]
*  Like if I stand out as being super virtuous, I'm going to get some points for that. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6944.56s)]
*  Some of that, I think, is going on. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6950.400000000001s)]
*  Multiple factors. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6952.8s)]
*  You know, we're in the middle of it now, I think probably within five years. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6955.8s)]
*  I mean, what five years ago, no one was talking about. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6958.44s)]
*  Was it a Ricky Gervais bit about the use of the term a woman without a penis? [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6960.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6967.72s)]
*  We would have never uttered this sentence five years ago. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6968.72s)]
*  Whatever it was, it was a really funny bit. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6972.5599999999995s)]
*  And probably five years from now, we won't be talking about this either. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6975.96s)]
*  Well, that's a good example because Ricky Gervais got a lot of death threats because [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6978.679999999999s)]
*  of that. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6982.0s)]
*  He had to really radically ramp up his security. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6983.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6985.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6986.08s)]
*  Well, OK. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6987.08s)]
*  So he's non-cancellable, right? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6988.08s)]
*  But what about all the comedians down here that are cancellable? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6990.88s)]
*  They're going to probably keep their mouth shut. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6994.64s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know that. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6996.64s)]
*  The thing is, there's a reward for speaking out and saying the things that everybody thinks [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=6999.24s)]
*  but they're afraid to say, particularly with audiences. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7006.76s)]
*  When you're anonymous in a crowd and you're having a couple of cocktails and it's dark [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7010.24s)]
*  and someone says it like, yes, finally. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7013.64s)]
*  You see it in comedy clubs that people are taking chances because they're recognizing [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7018.4400000000005s)]
*  that it's rewarded to speak out and say these things. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7023.36s)]
*  Another thing I think back to the kind of moral progress that we might be experiencing [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7028.84s)]
*  now is we've made so much moral progress. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7032.92s)]
*  Today's young activists that want to do something to make the world a better place. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7035.32s)]
*  Slavery, torture, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7040.240000000001s)]
*  Done. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7044.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7045.96s)]
*  What's next? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7046.96s)]
*  Oh, trans rights. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7047.96s)]
*  OK, I'm going to get out there. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7048.96s)]
*  OK, good. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7049.96s)]
*  That's good. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7050.96s)]
*  But as you said, the problem is that it gets in the way of women's rights. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7051.96s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7054.84s)]
*  Especially when it comes to athletic competition. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7055.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7057.200000000001s)]
*  So conflicting rights. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7058.200000000001s)]
*  Well, you can't have everything. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7059.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7060.200000000001s)]
*  So anyway, I think that's part of it. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7061.200000000001s)]
*  Like, I want to do something. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7062.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7063.200000000001s)]
*  Or like just think about the George Floyd protests and the BLM movement. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7064.200000000001s)]
*  What can I do about police violence against African Americans? [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7069.96s)]
*  I'm nobody. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7071.76s)]
*  I'm not the chief of police. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7072.76s)]
*  I'm not the mayor. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7074.92s)]
*  I'm just a citizen. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7076.16s)]
*  Well, there's a march tomorrow and we're going to go down there and we're going to voice [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7077.16s)]
*  our disapproval of the way African Americans are treated. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7080.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, I'm going to go down there and do it. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7084.08s)]
*  So I feel like I'm doing something. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7085.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7087.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7088.28s)]
*  A little bit like commenting on Twitter. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7089.28s)]
*  I'm outraged by this. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7090.28s)]
*  I feel like I did a little something. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7092.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7094.08s)]
*  Even though it probably doesn't do anything. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7095.08s)]
*  How do you think this stuff all plays out? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7096.84s)]
*  Do you think eventually it's one of those things like as we were talking about before, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7099.64s)]
*  the ebb and flow of things that, you know, there's an overcorrection and then things [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7102.84s)]
*  kind of bounce itself out? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7106.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7107.12s)]
*  I think you said it right. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7108.12s)]
*  That's right. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7109.12s)]
*  It's a pendulum. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7110.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7111.12s)]
*  And I think the pendulum going in this direction. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7112.12s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7113.12s)]
*  That's good. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7114.12s)]
*  That's good. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7115.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7116.12s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7117.12s)]
*  Come back. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7118.12s)]
*  Come back. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7119.12s)]
*  We went a little crazy. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7120.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7121.12s)]
*  Reel that thing in a little bit. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7122.12s)]
*  And then overall through time, we will get moral progress because of that. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7123.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7124.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7125.12s)]
*  So, you know, we saw a spike in the lifestyle as the other sex and so on. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7126.48s)]
*  Sure. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7127.86s)]
*  That's real. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7128.86s)]
*  Is it really the numbers that we're now seeing? [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7129.86s)]
*  You know, a spike, 2000% spike in the last two years in these massive increases in the [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7132.08s)]
*  UK and probably some of that is social contagion. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7136.98s)]
*  You know, that's sort of this is the thing to do. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7140.34s)]
*  Some of it may be real. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7143.38s)]
*  Well, we know social contagion is real. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7144.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7146.46s)]
*  We know that's real. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7147.46s)]
*  That's a real phenomenon. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7148.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7149.46s)]
*  So to say that that can't be it seems a little disingenuous. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7150.46s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7153.12s)]
*  like a lot of virtue signaling. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7154.12s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7156.2s)]
*  Right, so their counter to that is, well, society [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7157.36s)]
*  is more acceptable now, accepting [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7159.66s)]
*  of people that are different. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7162.04s)]
*  So that's why these people are coming out. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7163.4s)]
*  But the counter to that is, yeah, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7165.72s)]
*  but it's only in a certain cohort, age 15 to age 13 [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7167.22s)]
*  to 17 or so, where the huge spike is. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7170.92s)]
*  It's a lot of biological females, too. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7173.36s)]
*  Yeah, and it's way more. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7175.24s)]
*  Yeah, and that's Abigail Schreier's work, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7177.04s)]
*  Irreversible Damage. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7180.4s)]
*  I had a student maybe two years ago that came out as trans. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7182.32s)]
*  She decided she wanted to be a man. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7186.4s)]
*  And it's like, OK, and everybody was super curious about this. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7188.719999999999s)]
*  It's a small discussion seminar type class that I teach. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7191.5199999999995s)]
*  And as the course of the weeks went by, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7195.0s)]
*  it would come up almost every week. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7198.08s)]
*  It came up a lot. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7199.8s)]
*  And I thought, I wonder if she really wants to be a man [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7200.5199999999995s)]
*  or she wants to be trans, because trans, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7203.96s)]
*  this was a cool thing to be. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7206.32s)]
*  And she got love bombed, and everybody's [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7207.639999999999s)]
*  asking her questions. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7209.5599999999995s)]
*  What are you going to do about this? [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7210.4s)]
*  How are you going to dress? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7211.48s)]
*  What about that? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7212.04s)]
*  And you could see it was. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7213.28s)]
*  But if it was just like, I'm just going to be a man, [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7214.48s)]
*  and I'm not going to tell anybody I'm just going to change [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7216.4s)]
*  the way I'm living my life. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7218.5199999999995s)]
*  I think that would not be as interesting or rewarding. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7219.879999999999s)]
*  There would be no social reinforcement for that. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7223.4s)]
*  So I think in part, again, multiple things. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7226.799999999999s)]
*  Some of it's real. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7229.04s)]
*  Some of it's social. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7230.0s)]
*  I think some of it is this kind of a trendy thing to be. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7230.879999999999s)]
*  Andrew Sullivan writes about this. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7236.96s)]
*  It's not cool to be gay anymore. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7238.24s)]
*  Where'd the lesbians go? [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7239.5599999999995s)]
*  No more lesbians. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7241.28s)]
*  They're all gone. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7242.16s)]
*  And he makes the point, and since he's a gay guy, [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7244.32s)]
*  he could do this, that when he was a teenager boy, 13, 14, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7246.5599999999995s)]
*  he finds himself attracted to other guys and not women. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7250.12s)]
*  And what if he was told at that time, you're not gay. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7253.599999999999s)]
*  You're actually a woman. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7257.12s)]
*  You're just in the wrong body. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7259.0s)]
*  And then that's kind of, in a way, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7261.76s)]
*  he says it's kind of homophobic. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7263.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7265.2s)]
*  Yeah, my friend Tim says that. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7266.04s)]
*  He's gay. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7267.5599999999995s)]
*  He has that argument about it, that a lot of it [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7268.32s)]
*  is homophobic. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7270.44s)]
*  Whether it's really homophobic in their hearts, I don't know. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7273.4s)]
*  But it has that taint to it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7275.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7277.639999999999s)]
*  That there's, well, I mean, that's also the argument [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7278.719999999999s)]
*  that it's anti-women. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7281.879999999999s)]
*  You're changing what it means to be a woman. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7286.36s)]
*  And that's the film, what is a woman. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7289.08s)]
*  When you watch that film, you see the argument. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7292.96s)]
*  When Matt Walsh has these deadpan questions [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7295.32s)]
*  to these people, and it lets them just speak [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7298.2s)]
*  their thoughts about it, it's like, whoa, who thought [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7301.599999999999s)]
*  this was where we're at right now? [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7305.5599999999995s)]
*  Very strange. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7308.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7309.84s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of confusion there between gender and sex. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7310.84s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7313.12s)]
*  How do you define this stuff? [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7314.16s)]
*  I wrote about this. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7315.28s)]
*  Fuzzy sets, it's kind of a family resemblance. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7316.12s)]
*  What is a game? [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7318.5599999999995s)]
*  What is a chair? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7320.04s)]
*  Well, chair has got legs, four legs. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7320.88s)]
*  Well, this one has five. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7323.24s)]
*  It's got a back. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7324.24s)]
*  What about a bar stool? [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7324.84s)]
*  It doesn't have a back. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7326.32s)]
*  What about a beanbag chair? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7327.24s)]
*  That doesn't have legs or a back. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7328.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I know when I see one. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7331.0s)]
*  So we know what a man is. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7333.679999999999s)]
*  We know what a woman is. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7334.719999999999s)]
*  For the most part, we can identify them. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7335.76s)]
*  But there's going to be a little fuzzy around the fuzzy edges. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7341.16s)]
*  It's like, OK. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7341.679999999999s)]
*  But is it really a whole other category? [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7343.24s)]
*  So from an evolutionary biology perspective, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7345.84s)]
*  if we really had more than two sexes, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7348.92s)]
*  there would be a billion of the third sex, [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7351.8s)]
*  if that was a real thing, rather than as an anomaly. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7355.8s)]
*  Well, that's one of the weirder things about homosexuality [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7359.68s)]
*  in general, is that there's not really an evolutionary. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7362.6s)]
*  If you thought about the reproduction of whatever [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7371.68s)]
*  it means to be homosexual, well, it sort of eliminates that. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7375.6s)]
*  How is it that homosexuality has always [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7380.4800000000005s)]
*  maintained a certain percentage of our society? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7383.36s)]
*  It's really interesting, just from an objective perspective [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7387.32s)]
*  of looking at what it is, in terms of natural selection. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7390.24s)]
*  There was a comedian that had a joke about that, Otto and George. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7395.639999999999s)]
*  Otto and George was a puppet act from New York, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7399.16s)]
*  hilarious comedian. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7402.2s)]
*  And the puppet would say crazy shit. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7403.719999999999s)]
*  And he would go, what are you saying? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7406.12s)]
*  You know, like, that's outrageous. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7408.32s)]
*  How could you say that? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7409.5199999999995s)]
*  And his thing was like, about the gays, [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7410.759999999999s)]
*  he goes, from a bunch of people that can't reproduce, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7413.0s)]
*  where the fuck are they all coming from? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7416.68s)]
*  It was very funny. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7419.8s)]
*  It was funny. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7420.68s)]
*  Funny because it has kind of an element of a true question. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7421.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7424.2s)]
*  Why is there homosexuality in a sexually reproducing species [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7425.04s)]
*  like ours? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7427.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7428.36s)]
*  So evolutionary theorists have debates about this. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7428.76s)]
*  Maybe they're kind of surrogate parents, or pseudo parents, [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7430.72s)]
*  or faux parents to their siblings' offspring, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7433.44s)]
*  their uncles and aunts. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7437.84s)]
*  And that gets their genes for homosexuality [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7439.36s)]
*  in the next generation or something, [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7443.32s)]
*  because they're not reproducing directly. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7444.799999999999s)]
*  OK, maybe. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7447.32s)]
*  But it's not clear if it's that or if there's [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7448.24s)]
*  maybe there's no adaptive purpose to it at all. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7451.08s)]
*  It's just a byproduct. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7453.32s)]
*  Things happen. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7455.44s)]
*  There's just kind of randomness in sexual preferences. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7456.08s)]
*  It seems like that. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7458.4s)]
*  Because I've heard, well, there's [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7459.679999999999s)]
*  a spectrum of masculine females and feminine men. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7461.48s)]
*  The problem with that theory is there's [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7466.88s)]
*  a lot of very masculine gay men. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7469.76s)]
*  So it's like, well, what is that? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7472.6s)]
*  That's like a giant monkey wrench into your equation. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7475.76s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7478.76s)]
*  It seems to be just an aspect of human beings. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7480.4400000000005s)]
*  But again, going to moral progress, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7483.6s)]
*  it is a clear sign of moral progress. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7487.08s)]
*  The difference between when I was 11, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7489.4400000000005s)]
*  my friend's dad, who was so angry that people were gay [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7491.4800000000005s)]
*  and they were getting married, versus today, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7494.24s)]
*  where it's very accepted, for the most part. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7496.0s)]
*  It's a tiny percentage of people, [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7498.8s)]
*  I'm sure, still have a problem with it, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7500.2s)]
*  really extreme religious fundamentalists. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7501.88s)]
*  But for the most part, society has kind of accepted that. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7504.0s)]
*  Well, because religion endorsed a marriage initially, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7506.8s)]
*  and then the state got involved, its original purpose [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7511.12s)]
*  was reproduction. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7513.72s)]
*  And so that was why there was resistance by the church, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7515.4s)]
*  all the way up until really 2010s, against it, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7518.8s)]
*  because you're not making babies. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7522.36s)]
*  Well, what about older couples or couples that are infertile? [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7523.72s)]
*  That are heterosexual but infertile? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7527.64s)]
*  And there's always exceptions to this. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7529.84s)]
*  But that's kind of how it started. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7531.240000000001s)]
*  The purpose of marriage initially [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7532.4800000000005s)]
*  was to increase the population of either your religion [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7534.4400000000005s)]
*  or your government. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7537.16s)]
*  I mean, even today, if you're married, as you know, [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7538.84s)]
*  you get a tax break. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7541.240000000001s)]
*  I assume you do here in Texas, too. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7542.240000000001s)]
*  But the federal government gives you a tax break. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7543.76s)]
*  If you're married, if you have kids, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7545.280000000001s)]
*  you get another tax break. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7546.16s)]
*  In a way, the government say, we want you to be married, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7547.400000000001s)]
*  and we want you to have kids, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7549.88s)]
*  and we want you to be a homeowner, by the way. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7551.320000000001s)]
*  We'll let you deduct your interest on your mortgage. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7552.68s)]
*  And so the government does these sort of things, [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7555.08s)]
*  as religion did. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7557.4800000000005s)]
*  The whole primogeniture and the inheritance of the wealth [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7559.88s)]
*  to the first son and so on. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7563.400000000001s)]
*  All these rules were based on how can we grow our numbers [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7564.64s)]
*  and compete with the other religions. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7569.04s)]
*  So fecundity is a proxy for religious success. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7570.96s)]
*  You just have a lot of babies. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7574.64s)]
*  There's only two ways to grow a religion. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7575.72s)]
*  You have babies or you have converts, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7577.4400000000005s)]
*  and it's hard to convert people. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7579.04s)]
*  It was one of the things that people were really worried [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7580.68s)]
*  about with the reversal of Roe v. Wade, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7583.52s)]
*  is that gay marriage was gonna be next on the chopping block. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7585.52s)]
*  And there was discussions about that. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7588.360000000001s)]
*  Which is, that's a clear anti-progressive position. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7591.04s)]
*  It is, I'm worried about that. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7596.200000000001s)]
*  I'm hoping that this is just a couple of far out GOP [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7597.52s)]
*  candidates that are trying to appeal to their base by saying, [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7601.84s)]
*  we're gonna take away gay marriage, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7604.64s)]
*  and by the way, we're gonna get rid of contraception too. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7605.76s)]
*  We want women to just be in the bed making babies. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7607.56s)]
*  I'm hoping that the GOP in mass says, [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7610.36s)]
*  no, no, no, that's not what we're about. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7613.92s)]
*  But it is wild that in 2022, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7615.44s)]
*  that's still up for discussion. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7617.32s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7618.759999999999s)]
*  That people are literally talking about [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7619.599999999999s)]
*  getting rid of contraception. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7621.32s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7622.92s)]
*  Getting rid of gay marriage, getting rid of contraception, [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7624.5199999999995s)]
*  like hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7626.759999999999s)]
*  but isn't that the pendulum though? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7627.84s)]
*  Like what we were talking about. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7629.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7631.12s)]
*  Like with moral progress is gonna be an overcorrection. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7631.96s)]
*  Right. And that some people, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7635.2s)]
*  the outliers of the religious fundamentalists [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7637.6s)]
*  who don't want any progress, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7640.6s)]
*  they basically want things to go back to like [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7642.12s)]
*  a religious fundamentalist version [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7645.92s)]
*  of what a Christian society should be. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7649.72s)]
*  And there's some people that are out there, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7653.16s)]
*  and it's not a small number. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7654.360000000001s)]
*  That's what's spooky. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7655.56s)]
*  Christian nationalism is a thing. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7656.400000000001s)]
*  It's getting big. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7658.2s)]
*  It's getting bigger. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7659.360000000001s)]
*  Michael Flynn, you know, the general. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7660.68s)]
*  There's a new documentary out of CNN film about him [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7662.64s)]
*  in which this is a, he's got huge crowds [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7665.92s)]
*  in which he's basically saying we need to return America, [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7669.0s)]
*  make America great again, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7671.36s)]
*  but make America Christian again is what he's saying. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7672.36s)]
*  Well, he's one of those QAnon guys too. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7674.32s)]
*  Yeah, oh yeah. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7676.4s)]
*  Which is, if you've watched the documentary [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7677.36s)]
*  Into the Storm, have you seen the HBOs? [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7679.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7681.04s)]
*  It's amazing. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7681.88s)]
*  That's so good. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7682.92s)]
*  And I had the gentleman on who created that, [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7684.72s)]
*  and it just, what a fucking wild thing it is [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7686.96s)]
*  to see the actual people that created it, [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7690.4800000000005s)]
*  and to see what a scam they pulled off, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7693.84s)]
*  and how weird it is that people just hopped on board, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7696.76s)]
*  and they really did think that there was some people [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7699.68s)]
*  working behind the scenes that were working for God [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7702.72s)]
*  and country, and they were gonna expose all these [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7705.6s)]
*  pedophiles and Satanists and- [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7707.96s)]
*  The deep state. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7709.84s)]
*  Oh my God, it's amazing. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7710.8s)]
*  Do you think when, talk about this in the book, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7712.360000000001s)]
*  do you think when people say, I think they tell a poster, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7714.6s)]
*  yeah, I think there could be something to the QAnon [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7717.2s)]
*  or Pizza Gate or whatever, do they really believe it? [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7718.96s)]
*  I mean, the one guy did, Edgar Welch, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7722.24s)]
*  he went to that Comet Ping Pong Pizzeria with his AR-15, [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7723.5599999999995s)]
*  and shot up the place, but most people don't do that. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7726.5199999999995s)]
*  If you really thought there was a pedophile ring, [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7730.92s)]
*  a crime going on, and the police [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7733.96s)]
*  wouldn't do anything about it, wouldn't you go there? [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7735.5599999999995s)]
*  Wouldn't you wanna do something? [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7738.2s)]
*  So I'm thinking, I'm wondering, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7739.96s)]
*  did these people really believe it, [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7741.24s)]
*  or are they just kinda like, well, I don't know, [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7742.5599999999995s)]
*  it seems like the kind of thing those Democrats would do, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7744.5599999999995s)]
*  and I don't like them, or- [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7747.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a little bit of that. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7748.88s)]
*  Tribalism, or- [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7749.76s)]
*  I think there's also a little bit of, [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7750.96s)]
*  like what we were talking about earlier [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7753.8s)]
*  about conspiracy theories, they're exciting. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7755.08s)]
*  And for you to have secret information [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7758.0s)]
*  that's not available to everybody else, that could expose, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7761.6s)]
*  that's a big thing always, we're gonna expose these people, [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7765.16s)]
*  we're gonna expose the evil, expose the Satanists, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7768.16s)]
*  and expose the pedophiles, and expose, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7770.96s)]
*  there's a lot of people that don't have real excitement [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7773.88s)]
*  in their actual life. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7778.24s)]
*  And through online activities, and message boards, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7780.16s)]
*  and social media groups, and the like, they find purpose. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7784.24s)]
*  And one of the purposes is like to take down [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7789.84s)]
*  the evil empire, to take down the deep state. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7792.24s)]
*  There's a real inclination towards that. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7796.599999999999s)]
*  It's like the hero's journey, right? [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7799.36s)]
*  The Joseph Campbell, you go out and conquer the beast, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7800.72s)]
*  and come back, and it kinda makes your life meaningful. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7804.72s)]
*  I worked on this Netflix documentary on brainwashing, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7808.72s)]
*  and the producers found this woman in Texas, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7811.360000000001s)]
*  who went down the rabbit hole, the QAnon rabbit hole. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7814.72s)]
*  And so she was very successful, intelligent, educated, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7816.72s)]
*  good looking, married with kids, the whole thing. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7820.360000000001s)]
*  And then so she talks about this, you know, [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7823.84s)]
*  during COVID, the shutdown, my business sorta collapsed, [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7826.12s)]
*  I was bored outta my skull, I'm online all day, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7829.4800000000005s)]
*  the next thing you know, like six months later, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7832.72s)]
*  her husband's giving her an ultimatum, it's QAnon or me. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7835.16s)]
*  And she actually, she had the phone, [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7839.4800000000005s)]
*  she goes, here's the message he left me. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7841.52s)]
*  And she said, initially she said, [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7843.4800000000005s)]
*  this is the most important thing I'll ever do. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7846.56s)]
*  I am exposed to this crime, I'm changing the world, [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7849.72s)]
*  I am a warrior, I'm outta here. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7853.8s)]
*  And then a couple months later, I guess she woke up [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7857.280000000001s)]
*  and went, what the fuck did I do? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7859.56s)]
*  My husband's leaving me, I'm losing my kids and house, what? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7861.8s)]
*  How did she get so wrapped up in it? [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7864.360000000001s)]
*  Did she ever talk about it afterwards? [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7866.08s)]
*  Yeah, just, well, just again, the daily kinda feed online, [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7867.96s)]
*  which you can find websites on anything. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7871.64s)]
*  Yeah, but that one in particular [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7874.2s)]
*  was like particularly engrossing for some people. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7875.96s)]
*  It became their whole life. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7879.0s)]
*  And that was documented in that, into the storm. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7880.32s)]
*  With those poor people, and some of them [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7883.56s)]
*  that were Obama supporters, that just flipped over, [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7885.0s)]
*  now I realize, they're the bad ones, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7888.52s)]
*  and we're the good ones, and we're patriots, and it's crazy. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7890.76s)]
*  Well, yeah, and there's entertainment value. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7894.88s)]
*  These things are really interesting and fun to read about. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7897.12s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7900.16s)]
*  Well, that goes along with all the other conspiracy theories. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7901.48s)]
*  Like I went into a, unfortunately, last night, [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7904.12s)]
*  I went down a rabbit hole of Bigfoot. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7907.36s)]
*  You did? [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7909.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, I went down the Bigfoot rabbit hole last night. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7910.36s)]
*  Boy, that's an old one. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7913.68s)]
*  It's an old one. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7914.64s)]
*  There was a video that showed up in my YouTube feed, [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7915.64s)]
*  and I clicked on it, and then you know how YouTube, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7919.72s)]
*  on the right-hand side, it gives you, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7921.96s)]
*  maybe you wanna watch this. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7923.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah, of course. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7924.44s)]
*  So I forget what the initial video was, [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7925.28s)]
*  but I went three or four videos down the hole, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7929.04s)]
*  and I got to a professor out of Oregon, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7931.719999999999s)]
*  and I've actually, Meldrum. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7935.44s)]
*  Yes, I know that guy. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7936.92s)]
*  Yeah, I've actually had him on the podcast before, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7938.12s)]
*  when I was doing that Joe Rogan questions everything thing. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7940.12s)]
*  He was a guy that said that he would cut off [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7943.12s)]
*  one of his fingers, if he could find out [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7945.599999999999s)]
*  that Bigfoot was real. The real one. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7947.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7949.0s)]
*  So I went down, I watched him being interviewed, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7950.32s)]
*  and then, oh, now I remember what it was. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7956.24s)]
*  When I was in England, I was watching a show on television [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7958.36s)]
*  that was like one of those discovery shows about monsters, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7961.28s)]
*  and it was like, just a clearly bullshit show [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7965.639999999999s)]
*  where they're like, we're gonna go find him, [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7969.4s)]
*  we're gonna use night vision, and we're going to the woods, [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7971.28s)]
*  and these people all believe it, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7973.32s)]
*  and so I'm like, how many episodes are there [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7974.719999999999s)]
*  of this fucking thing? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7976.92s)]
*  And then I started. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7977.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7978.639999999999s)]
*  There's so many, but this professor who, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7980.08s)]
*  I think he's a professor of anthropology. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7982.639999999999s)]
*  He's like a legitimate professor. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7985.24s)]
*  I think it's University of Oregon. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7987.52s)]
*  Well, this is, again, my argument, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7989.2s)]
*  why the rational believe the irrational. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7990.56s)]
*  These are not uneducated, stupid people [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7992.400000000001s)]
*  wearing tinfoil hat. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7994.56s)]
*  No, they're not, they're smart people. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7996.12s)]
*  But smart people and educated people [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7998.0s)]
*  are better at rationalizing beliefs they hold [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=7999.92s)]
*  for non-smart reasons. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8001.92s)]
*  So, do you know Reinhold Mezner, the great alpinist [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8003.92s)]
*  that summited Everest, I think seven times without oxygen, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8006.8s)]
*  considered the greatest climber of all time, [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8009.88s)]
*  a German alpinist? [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8011.36s)]
*  He wrote a book about Bigfoot, Yeti, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8013.28s)]
*  because he's heard all about Yeti in the Himalayas, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8016.16s)]
*  and he had told all the sherpas, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8018.5199999999995s)]
*  okay, look, if you see this thing, [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8020.24s)]
*  just wake me up out of the tent. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8021.92s)]
*  So one day they're like, boss, boss, [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8023.76s)]
*  it's there, it's there, Yeti. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8025.92s)]
*  He's like, oh my God, oh my God. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8027.4s)]
*  So they go, they hike and hike around the corner, [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8029.04s)]
*  and there's this big bear. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8030.679999999999s)]
*  He's like, that's Yeti? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8031.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's Yeti. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8033.44s)]
*  It's like, oh, okay. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8034.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's certainly a lot of it. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8036.92s)]
*  A lot of it is, and bears do walk upright all the time, [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8038.639999999999s)]
*  especially if they get an injured front paw, [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8042.08s)]
*  they're capable of walking upright. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8043.72s)]
*  I've seen in the wild, I've seen bears walk upright. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8044.76s)]
*  Oh my God, wow. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8047.28s)]
*  Black bears, from very close, from 20 yards away. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8048.32s)]
*  I've seen them walk multiple steps on their back feet. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8051.4s)]
*  Now, if you were looking at that through the forest, [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8055.8s)]
*  like a deep forest, I don't think it's a coincidence [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8058.48s)]
*  that the Pacific Northwest is where they sight a lot of them, [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8062.24s)]
*  because there's a rainforest out there that are so dense. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8064.88s)]
*  It's like, the way I describe it is like a box of Q-tips. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8067.64s)]
*  Like seeing through all the Q-tips, you can't possibly see. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8070.52s)]
*  So if you saw a bear walking on two legs [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8073.120000000001s)]
*  through a couple of trees, and then your mind starts going, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8075.8s)]
*  oh my God, did I just see a gorilla, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8079.400000000001s)]
*  or some sort of an ape creature? [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8081.96s)]
*  It's Bigfoot! [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8083.68s)]
*  And then you have it in your head that you saw a Bigfoot, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8084.72s)]
*  because you saw a bear. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8086.68s)]
*  A bear, a big black bear is a seven-foot animal. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8088.360000000001s)]
*  It's a big creature. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8091.8s)]
*  They're walking upright like that. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8092.84s)]
*  You would assume that that is a giant Sasquatch [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8094.56s)]
*  that you just saw. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8097.040000000001s)]
*  And then your mind starts working on it, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8098.160000000001s)]
*  and your memory sucks anyway, especially with chaotic, [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8100.16s)]
*  extremely novel events like that. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8104.16s)]
*  And so then you get it in your head that you saw a Sasquatch. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8106.48s)]
*  Well, this is how illusions work. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8109.72s)]
*  Those auditory illusions where they [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8111.04s)]
*  put the words on the top of the screen, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8113.72s)]
*  and they play the voice. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8115.639999999999s)]
*  You can't quite make out what it is, [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8117.2s)]
*  but when you see the words that he's saying, [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8118.639999999999s)]
*  and it flips back and forth, back and forth. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8120.8s)]
*  So this works because when you can't quite tell what it is, [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8123.12s)]
*  then a cue, a prime, it's called priming, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8127.24s)]
*  will direct your brain to hear one thing or the other thing, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8130.32s)]
*  or see things. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8133.16s)]
*  This is how these visual illusions work. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8134.0s)]
*  So it's always degraded information. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8136.16s)]
*  The shadow, I can't quite see. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8138.0s)]
*  If you squint and use your imagination, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8139.5199999999995s)]
*  I can sort of see the two legs and maybe an arm. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8141.16s)]
*  But for biologists, it's pretty simple. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8145.92s)]
*  Just show me the body, and I'll accept it. [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8148.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know who doesn't believe in Bigfoot? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8149.92s)]
*  The people that are in the woods all the time. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8152.639999999999s)]
*  All of my friends that are hunters, [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8154.84s)]
*  the most extreme, hardcore guys who backpack [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8157.4800000000005s)]
*  and go deep into the mountains for weeks at a time. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8161.04s)]
*  None of them. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8165.28s)]
*  Zero sightings. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8166.16s)]
*  Really? [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8167.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8168.04s)]
*  The people that are the sightings are the casuals. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8168.88s)]
*  The people that don't spend any time in the woods. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8171.36s)]
*  Well, Cryptozolla just say, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8173.96s)]
*  well, we didn't know about the mountain gorilla [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8175.12s)]
*  until 1903. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8176.76s)]
*  But we know. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8178.0s)]
*  But we would know by now. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8179.84s)]
*  Yes, that's not a good example, [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8181.12s)]
*  because it was a fucking really clear video [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8182.52s)]
*  of the mountain gorilla. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8184.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8185.28s)]
*  The thing about the Bigfoot thing that is, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8186.16s)]
*  there's always an element of something in there. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8189.639999999999s)]
*  The thing about Bigfoot that's fascinating [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8191.639999999999s)]
*  is the gigantopithecus. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8193.52s)]
*  Is that it did coincide with the human beings [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8195.44s)]
*  of 100,000 years ago. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8199.119999999999s)]
*  So we know for sure then. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8200.52s)]
*  So you would imagine that maybe 50,000 years ago [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8202.92s)]
*  there were some of them still. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8206.08s)]
*  And maybe it's legend and folklore. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8207.56s)]
*  There's many things that are passed on [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8209.56s)]
*  through myth and discussions and stories. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8211.44s)]
*  That's probably what it was. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8215.28s)]
*  At one point in time there was a gigantic bipedal hominid [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8217.160000000002s)]
*  that was eight to 10 feet tall. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8221.52s)]
*  We know they're real. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8223.44s)]
*  We know that's a, but it's just an animal that existed. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8224.44s)]
*  Just like an orangutan, just like a gorilla, [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8227.68s)]
*  chimpanzee, there was a hominid. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8230.68s)]
*  A large sort of primate creature [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8233.0s)]
*  that was really enormous, but died out. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8237.08s)]
*  Given our propensity to stereotype things, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8240.320000000002s)]
*  imagine if Neanderthals had not gone extinct [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8242.2s)]
*  and they were still around. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8245.32s)]
*  And they were somehow different from us or whatever. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8246.32s)]
*  Would we enslave them? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8249.199999999999s)]
*  Would we kill them off? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8250.8s)]
*  Would we treat them equally? [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8251.88s)]
*  That's probably what the humans, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8254.24s)]
*  the homo sapiens did to them. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8256.08s)]
*  There's different theories about that. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8258.24s)]
*  Well, so 2% of our genome is Neanderthal. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8260.039999999999s)]
*  I call this the Steven Stills explanation. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8263.64s)]
*  Steven Stills, if you can't be with the one you love, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8266.4s)]
*  love the one you're with. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8268.519999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8269.64s)]
*  Well, I'm alone in the cave tonight. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8272.279999999999s)]
*  There's no homo sapiens around, [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8275.04s)]
*  but hey, here's a Neanderthal. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8276.44s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you wonder, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8278.68s)]
*  was it homo sapien females that bred [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8281.08s)]
*  with the Neanderthal males, [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8284.480000000001s)]
*  or was it Neanderthal females that homo sapien males? [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8285.92s)]
*  I wonder what was the predominant. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8289.960000000001s)]
*  Well, given human sexual psychology [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8292.560000000001s)]
*  and the differences between men and women [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8294.76s)]
*  and how indiscriminate men are compared to women, [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8296.480000000001s)]
*  women are much more risk averse about that. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8299.2s)]
*  They have fewer partners. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8301.800000000001s)]
*  They want fewer partners. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8302.68s)]
*  Probably male to female, I'm guessing. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8304.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, makes sense. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8307.2s)]
*  But also then, who knows? [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8308.48s)]
*  We're talking about an incredibly aggressive time. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8311.880000000001s)]
*  How much of that was rape? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8315.36s)]
*  Yes, right, right. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8316.960000000001s)]
*  A lot of animal breeding is basically rape. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8318.36s)]
*  A lot of the way, you ever see koala bears, mate? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8323.52s)]
*  The cute little fellas? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8326.28s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it, yeah. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8327.12s)]
*  Disturbing. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8329.0s)]
*  Pretty violent. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8330.04s)]
*  Pretty ruthless and violent. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8330.88s)]
*  And cats, when you see cats, it's horrific. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8332.599999999999s)]
*  You wonder, it's also, the human species [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8336.08s)]
*  is so fascinating too, because they're always finding [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8340.199999999999s)]
*  Dennis Ovens, there's always finding these [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8342.24s)]
*  new branches of humans. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8344.599999999999s)]
*  How many of them were there? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8347.039999999999s)]
*  And then there's the hobbit people. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8348.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the hobbits, right? [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8349.96s)]
*  Probably at least a dozen bipedal primates [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8350.8s)]
*  at the same time. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8353.439999999999s)]
*  The island of Flores hobbit people, that is fascinating. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8355.599999999999s)]
*  Because I think they boiled that one down to, [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8359.28s)]
*  what was it, like 15, 20,000 years ago? [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8361.400000000001s)]
*  Right, not that long ago. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8363.6s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8364.800000000001s)]
*  After Neanderthals, when it's been here. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8365.720000000001s)]
*  Yes, that there was these little three foot tall, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8366.92s)]
*  and they don't really know what they looked like [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8369.04s)]
*  other than guesswork, but they think they were hairy. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8370.92s)]
*  It was a hairy little three foot tall, bipedal, [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8373.880000000001s)]
*  people-like things that were a separate branch [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8376.320000000002s)]
*  of the evolutionary chain of primates. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8379.2s)]
*  I remember when that story broke, [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8383.44s)]
*  it's a pretty dense forested island, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8384.880000000001s)]
*  and it was like, maybe they're still there. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8387.0s)]
*  They're holed up in some cave. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8389.44s)]
*  Well, there's a belief that there's a thing [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8390.960000000001s)]
*  called an Orang Pendek. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8393.52s)]
*  You ever heard of that one? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8395.04s)]
*  Orang Pendek is very similar in stature and description. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8396.48s)]
*  I think they believe they're in Vietnam. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8402.2s)]
*  I think it's maybe Cambodia or Vietnam. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8405.960000000001s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8408.640000000001s)]
*  But that is one of those mythological creatures [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8410.12s)]
*  that until they found, the Flores people, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8412.960000000001s)]
*  I think they found them in, [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8416.08s)]
*  I wanna say it's the 2000s. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8417.800000000001s)]
*  The late 90s are the 2000s that they discovered those. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8419.960000000001s)]
*  And then they started saying, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8423.44s)]
*  well, hey, maybe there was something [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8424.4s)]
*  to that Orang Pendek thing too, [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8425.76s)]
*  because it's a similar part of the world [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8428.0s)]
*  and a similar shape creature. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8430.44s)]
*  But they were talking about, there it is. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8433.6s)]
*  Have we found evidence of the elusive Orang Pendek? [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8435.960000000001s)]
*  Interesting, describes last month an expedition [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8440.68s)]
*  in the jungles of Sumatra on the trail of the, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8442.880000000001s)]
*  so even the age of satellite mapping, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8446.16s)]
*  global positioning, there are remains, [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8449.52s)]
*  lost worlds where few humans tread, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8451.119999999999s)]
*  where species of animals unrecognized by science live. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8453.36s)]
*  I'll say this name. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8457.44s)]
*  Karenseys Seblat National Park in West Sumatra [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8459.039999999999s)]
*  is one such place. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8463.08s)]
*  The size of a small country, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8464.68s)]
*  its dim, steamy interior has never been explored properly. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8466.16s)]
*  And last month, I returned to these jungles [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8469.76s)]
*  for the fourth time to track an elusive [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8471.72s)]
*  and yet unrecorded species of ape known to the locals [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8473.960000000001s)]
*  as the Orang Pendek or short man. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8477.68s)]
*  This year's expedition was the largest of its kind [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8481.36s)]
*  to ever visit the area. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8484.56s)]
*  It consisted of two teams. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8485.88s)]
*  The first made up of Adam Davies, [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8487.52s)]
*  expedition leader for the Center for 14 Zoology, [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8489.52s)]
*  Dave Archer, Andrew Sanderson, and myself [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8492.88s)]
*  would concentrate on the highland jungles [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8495.76s)]
*  around Lake Gunung, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8497.68s)]
*  Gunung, Tujuh, I'm just guessing there. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8500.64s)]
*  The second team consisted of Dr. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8504.0s)]
*  Okay, what does it say? [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8507.279999999999s)]
*  Before team left, one guide, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8508.279999999999s)]
*  Sahar, introduced us to an eyewitness called Pak Antis [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8511.199999999999s)]
*  who claimed to have seen an Orang Pendek [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8514.76s)]
*  in the garden area in April. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8517.24s)]
*  He described it as around three feet tall, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8519.36s)]
*  but with massive shoulders and chest. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8521.36s)]
*  He pointed to a piece of washing on the line [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8523.48s)]
*  to indicate the color of its hair. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8526.24s)]
*  A mid tan, it had an ape-like face, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8528.4s)]
*  walked upright on two legs while swinging its arms. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8531.039999999999s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8535.96s)]
*  Well, you need a breeding population for it. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8536.8s)]
*  If they last centuries or thousands of years, [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8539.44s)]
*  you can't just have one or two. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8541.52s)]
*  Right, but if this thing is living [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8542.76s)]
*  in an unexplored area the size of a small country. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8544.64s)]
*  Right, yeah, that's enough. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8547.0s)]
*  Yeah, that would be amazing. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8548.279999999999s)]
*  Could you imagine? [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8550.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, now with that, we know that it exists. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8551.039999999999s)]
*  We have plenty of fossil evidence and bone evidence [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8552.84s)]
*  and DNA that points to that. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8555.88s)]
*  Homo floresiensis. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8558.4s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8560.24s)]
*  Given how many of these species went extinct, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8561.199999999999s)]
*  we're the only ones still around. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8563.32s)]
*  Imagine if it hadn't been, [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8565.279999999999s)]
*  if we had gone extinct and Neanderthals survived, [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8566.84s)]
*  would they be making spaceships and internet computers? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8570.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8574.24s)]
*  So it's a question of progress, [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8575.08s)]
*  evolutionary and cultural progress. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8577.199999999999s)]
*  Is there a certain inevitability to it? [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8579.08s)]
*  Which brings us back to the SETI question. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8581.16s)]
*  You could have a planet in which life gets all the way [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8583.44s)]
*  up to the level of Neanderthal complexity [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8585.64s)]
*  with big brains and hands and art and so on. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8588.84s)]
*  And maybe you never detect them [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8591.480000000001s)]
*  because they never get to a stage [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8593.2s)]
*  where they make radio technology [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8594.76s)]
*  and spaceships and things like that. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8598.68s)]
*  Is that possible? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8601.36s)]
*  See, that's a, I'm just kind of asking rhetorically. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8602.560000000001s)]
*  It seems like it could be. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8605.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8606.12s)]
*  I mean, we probably would have never gotten [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8606.960000000001s)]
*  to where we are if it wasn't for the asteroid impact [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8608.240000000002s)]
*  that killed the dinosaurs. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8611.640000000001s)]
*  Right, yes, right. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8612.480000000001s)]
*  So so much of it is kind of chance. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8613.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8615.0s)]
*  And Neanderthal looks like they had language [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8615.84s)]
*  based on the skull size back here [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8619.2s)]
*  and some other things here and their genome. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8620.8s)]
*  It looks like they had the genes for language, maybe. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8624.12s)]
*  Something like, not ours totally conceptually, [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8626.44s)]
*  but maybe something like that. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8629.12s)]
*  Would they, were they held back by us? [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8631.08s)]
*  Because they had Europe to themselves [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8633.960000000001s)]
*  for about 300,000 years. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8635.4s)]
*  But their toolkits don't get progressively more complex [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8638.28s)]
*  and their art doesn't get more complex like ours does. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8641.4s)]
*  When we got to Europe and they went extinct [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8644.36s)]
*  and then you see that kind of progress. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8646.36s)]
*  So it's an open question that no one knows the answer to, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8648.2s)]
*  but it touches on the SETI thing [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8650.2s)]
*  because is there kind of a directionality to evolution [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8652.12s)]
*  where you end up with communicating [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8656.04s)]
*  technologically sophisticated civilizations [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8658.140000000001s)]
*  or is it pretty random and you could get pretty far [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8660.2s)]
*  and then we'd never know that they were there? [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8663.560000000001s)]
*  Well, I think if you think about the absolutely [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8665.400000000001s)]
*  enormous numbers of possibilities, [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8668.960000000001s)]
*  you probably have all of them. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8671.400000000001s)]
*  You probably have places where dinosaurs just rule [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8672.96s)]
*  and that's it and shrews, stage shrews. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8676.16s)]
*  Right, right, the impact never happened on that planet. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8679.199999999999s)]
*  Or you get to something where you have [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8682.08s)]
*  a completely different sort of an environment [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8684.439999999999s)]
*  and things progress far more rapidly. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8687.119999999999s)]
*  And they also don't have the concern [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8689.679999999998s)]
*  with asteroid impacts or natural disasters. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8692.359999999999s)]
*  It's a much more stable environment on these planets. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8695.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, you think of the variability would be endless. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8698.06s)]
*  Just the sheer numbers of planets you're dealing with. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8701.28s)]
*  The question is, once we find life somewhere else, [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8704.84s)]
*  then it all becomes open-ended, right? [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8707.800000000001s)]
*  Once we find absolute evidence that there's a life form [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8709.460000000001s)]
*  on this other spinning body that's circling around a star, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8712.960000000001s)]
*  we got one. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8717.640000000001s)]
*  Okay, now we have some moving creatures [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8718.480000000001s)]
*  that exist on this planet, holy cow, now we know for sure. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8721.16s)]
*  I had an interesting discussion with Richard Dawkins [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8724.960000000001s)]
*  one time about to what extent [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8727.300000000001s)]
*  that aliens would look anything like us. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8731.12s)]
*  Like the alien abduction stories, [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8733.26s)]
*  it's always this bipedal primate with the big eyes [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8734.62s)]
*  and the bulbous head and no ears and so forth. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8737.26s)]
*  But what are the chances they'd look anything like us? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8741.18s)]
*  Evolved on some other planet, right? [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8743.94s)]
*  They could be like octopuses or something. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8745.86s)]
*  But Richard points out as it may not be as random [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8748.54s)]
*  as I'm describing because Simon Conway Morris [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8751.2s)]
*  who studies convergent evolution [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8754.54s)]
*  shows that based on physics of water, air and land, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8757.64s)]
*  to move around on the land, [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8761.119999999999s)]
*  you gotta have something like legs. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8762.519999999999s)]
*  To move through the water, [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8763.88s)]
*  you have to have kind of a smooth fusiform body [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8764.72s)]
*  to slide through such a dense medium. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8767.0s)]
*  If you're in the air, [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8769.0s)]
*  you gotta have something like wings, right? [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8769.82s)]
*  And so you're gonna have probably creatures [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8771.72s)]
*  with most of the sensory apparatus and brains on one end, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8774.24s)]
*  waste disposal system on the other end, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8777.439999999999s)]
*  some arms and legs to move around on the land. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8778.96s)]
*  You could get something like a bipedal primate, [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8781.0s)]
*  may not be a mammal or whatever, [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8783.48s)]
*  it could be a dinosaur that was bipedal. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8785.04s)]
*  And if you have a big enough brain, [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8787.240000000002s)]
*  they could have big tools and so on. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8788.400000000001s)]
*  So it could be something like that. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8789.52s)]
*  Could be, but then you also have the intelligent life [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8791.160000000002s)]
*  that we know exists on earth [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8793.960000000001s)]
*  that doesn't have the ability to manipulate its environment [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8795.900000000001s)]
*  like orcas and dolphins, which is fascinating [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8799.12s)]
*  because orca and dolphin have enormous brains. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8802.2s)]
*  They have complex languages that we can't decipher. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8805.060000000001s)]
*  They have very sophisticated social systems. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8807.660000000002s)]
*  But they don't possess the ability [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8812.240000000002s)]
*  to manipulate their environment like we do. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8814.24s)]
*  They never needed it. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8816.08s)]
*  They can move through 3D space. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8816.92s)]
*  They're inside the water. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8818.88s)]
*  They're the apex predators, [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8819.96s)]
*  particularly orcas, they have no threat. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8821.6s)]
*  That is really fascinating. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8824.119999999999s)]
*  Again, you could have a planet with that [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8825.88s)]
*  and we never know that they're there [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8827.52s)]
*  unless we go there and see them. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8828.96s)]
*  Is there any evidence that there were any dinosaurs [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8830.72s)]
*  that had any sort of advanced larger brains? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8834.28s)]
*  No, not that I know of. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8839.76s)]
*  Although people like Jack Horner, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8842.72s)]
*  the paleontologist, he thinks they're much more social [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8844.84s)]
*  and communicating in a social way [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8847.800000000001s)]
*  than we've given them credit for. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8851.320000000002s)]
*  They weren't dumb. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8852.44s)]
*  Not big brains like you're thinking of the cetaceans. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8853.68s)]
*  Cetaceans have big brains to their body size. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8856.36s)]
*  There you would expect more intelligence. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8859.76s)]
*  But yeah, well, I don't know. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8861.6s)]
*  Probably not. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8865.720000000001s)]
*  They never had tools, for example. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8866.92s)]
*  So they don't really need them. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8869.92s)]
*  But it seems like super intelligent life forms, [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8872.0s)]
*  they're either like us [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8875.279999999999s)]
*  or they're like a dolphin and an orca on this planet. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8877.24s)]
*  Or crows. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8881.279999999999s)]
*  Yes, crows, right. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8882.599999999999s)]
*  Sagan was always careful about this anthropomorphizing [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8883.839999999998s)]
*  what the aliens would be like. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8886.919999999998s)]
*  Kind of the chauvinism of it. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8889.919999999998s)]
*  They're gonna be like us. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8891.279999999999s)]
*  Well, how many species on Earth are like us? [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8892.4s)]
*  None. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8895.24s)]
*  We can't even talk to an octopus or a dolphin. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8897.08s)]
*  We don't know what they're saying. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8900.64s)]
*  And if we can't talk to them, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8902.72s)]
*  and they grew up, they're mammals. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8903.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8904.880000000001s)]
*  And they're on the same planet as us. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8905.72s)]
*  How are we gonna communicate with aliens? [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8907.52s)]
*  This was an interesting group [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8909.68s)]
*  that Sagan was part of, this dolphin. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8911.76s)]
*  It was called the Dolphin Society or something. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8914.16s)]
*  John C. Lilly was this. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8917.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8918.56s)]
*  I forget the name of it. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8919.76s)]
*  But then he started giving dolphins LSD and stuff. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8920.6s)]
*  Yeah, we also had that experiment [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8924.48s)]
*  where he had the woman living in the home with a dolphin [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8926.44s)]
*  and she had to masturbate the dolphin [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8929.68s)]
*  to get it to pay attention. [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8932.2s)]
*  And so they killed the study once that came out. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8933.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8935.0s)]
*  Which is unfortunate. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8935.84s)]
*  But he was also like, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8937.76s)]
*  he invented the sensory deprivation tank. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8939.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8942.16s)]
*  He was a really out there guy. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8944.04s)]
*  And he was into ketamine for whatever weird reason. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8946.12s)]
*  He would take intramuscular ketamine [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8949.0s)]
*  and then get in the sensory deprivation tank. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8950.84s)]
*  I've heard you talk about this. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8954.16s)]
*  I just wanted to ask you directly. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8955.24s)]
*  When somebody takes LSD [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8956.880000000001s)]
*  or one of the others [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8960.4s)]
*  and they feel like it's a door opening, [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8962.76s)]
*  doors of perception, into some other reality, [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8965.0s)]
*  is there really a reality or is it just brain chemistry? [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8967.48s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8971.199999999999s)]
*  I think you're thinking of dimethyltryptamine. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8972.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8974.24s)]
*  The reason why dimethyltryptamine is so interesting [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8975.08s)]
*  is because it's endogenous. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8976.68s)]
*  The human brain produces it. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8978.52s)]
*  It's trackable. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8980.44s)]
*  You can find it. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8982.56s)]
*  And now through the Cottonwood Research Foundation, [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8983.44s)]
*  they've found that the brain, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8986.44s)]
*  they used to think it was the pineal gland, [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8989.160000000002s)]
*  but I had Dr. Rick Strassman on, [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8991.28s)]
*  who conducted the first FDA approved studies on psychedelics [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=8994.880000000001s)]
*  through with dimethyltryptamine, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9001.12s)]
*  where they were IV dosing these people with it. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9003.52s)]
*  And I actually had a conversation with Graham Hancock [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9006.08s)]
*  when I was in London this weekend. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9008.0s)]
*  And he said that they're doing some [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9009.560000000001s)]
*  at the University of London now too, [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9011.160000000002s)]
*  that are very fascinating, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9012.720000000001s)]
*  where they're doing the same sort of thing, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9015.240000000002s)]
*  where they're using IV drips [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9016.880000000001s)]
*  so they can prolong the DMT state [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9019.279999999999s)]
*  for very long periods of time [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9021.039999999999s)]
*  and then come back with these very similar descriptions [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9022.32s)]
*  of what's going on. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9025.56s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9026.4s)]
*  Who knows what is happening? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9028.72s)]
*  If that is a doorway that opens up in the mind [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9031.56s)]
*  that leads you to another dimension, [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9034.32s)]
*  or whether it's the human consciousness, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9035.76s)]
*  the imagination and the visual cortex [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9038.519999999999s)]
*  interacting with these incredibly powerful [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9042.039999999999s)]
*  psychoactive compounds [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9044.92s)]
*  that give a similar visual hallucination to everyone. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9046.6s)]
*  I don't think there's a way to know right now. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9051.32s)]
*  Right, so this is kind of an epistemological problem. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9054.04s)]
*  What should I believe is true? [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9056.76s)]
*  I don't know about that, because what if, [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9058.84s)]
*  so Richard Dawkins and I have this kind of [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9060.800000000001s)]
*  standing invitation to go to this [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9062.880000000001s)]
*  ayahuasca place in Costa Rica. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9064.44s)]
*  And Richard had a stroke, he said, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9066.52s)]
*  I don't think I better do this, [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9068.640000000001s)]
*  and I think I probably won't do it, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9069.92s)]
*  but I'm curious to know what if I did it? [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9072.32s)]
*  And I came back, I said, oh my God, Joe, [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9074.28s)]
*  I've been a skeptic and a materialist, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9077.0s)]
*  and I've discovered that there's this other reality. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9079.08s)]
*  And you go, well, how do you know it's true? [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9081.96s)]
*  I said, because I experienced it. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9083.68s)]
*  And then you go, well, how can I know it's true? [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9085.72s)]
*  Here, you try it. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9088.0s)]
*  And then you go, yeah, I went, I did it, you're right. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9089.32s)]
*  But how does Jamie know? [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9092.199999999999s)]
*  Well, he has to try it. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9094.039999999999s)]
*  How do we get out of the loop that it may just be [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9095.8s)]
*  brain chemistry and nothing more than that, [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9098.6s)]
*  or you're actually going somewhere? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9100.36s)]
*  Have we hit an epistemological wall we can't know? [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9101.88s)]
*  I don't know what the answer to that is, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9104.92s)]
*  but I do think that it would benefit you to try it [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9107.24s)]
*  just so that you could experience something [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9110.0s)]
*  that's so profoundly unique that it throws into question [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9111.839999999998s)]
*  what reality is overall, because we think of reality [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9117.199999999999s)]
*  as only being things that we can measure, [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9122.359999999999s)]
*  things that we can touch, things we can put on a scale, [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9124.759999999998s)]
*  and you, as the editor of Skeptic Magazine in particular, [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9127.16s)]
*  you're very skeptical about things, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9131.08s)]
*  but what you experience with the most potent [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9132.32s)]
*  of hallucinogens, whether it's mushrooms, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9135.279999999999s)]
*  whether it's psilocybin, or whether it's dimethyltryptamine, [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9137.76s)]
*  or any of these really, really potent ones, [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9140.44s)]
*  you experience something that seems so much more vivid [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9143.0s)]
*  than reality itself. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9146.199999999999s)]
*  It's very confusing. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9147.96s)]
*  It's like, what is happening here? [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9149.16s)]
*  Am I actually interacting with entities, [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9151.36s)]
*  or are there thoughts that I have in my mind [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9154.039999999999s)]
*  that are so potent and profound, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9159.119999999999s)]
*  like things like creativity and love and emotions, [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9161.6s)]
*  that if you attach them to this psychedelic compound, [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9164.08s)]
*  they dance for you in a way that seems like [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9166.84s)]
*  they're an actual entity? [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9168.960000000001s)]
*  Who knows? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9171.28s)]
*  But I would like you to do it. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9172.2s)]
*  I'd like you to do it just because I respect your opinion, [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9173.48s)]
*  and I'd like to see what your thought is [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9176.12s)]
*  when you come back from it. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9178.76s)]
*  I would imagine I would have a profound experience, [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9179.720000000001s)]
*  because most people do, right? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9181.92s)]
*  I don't think I've talked to anybody [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9183.36s)]
*  that hasn't had a profound experience, [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9184.6s)]
*  or at least an interesting one. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9186.640000000001s)]
*  I read Oliver Sacks' memoir, his autobiography, [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9188.080000000002s)]
*  where he did this stuff, [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9191.880000000001s)]
*  and he decided it was just all brain chemistry. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9193.44s)]
*  But it was super profound, [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9195.76s)]
*  like he was in a restaurant, [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9198.04s)]
*  and the people all have these fly-like heads. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9199.52s)]
*  Which one did he do? [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9202.080000000002s)]
*  I think he did LSD, or maybe, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9203.480000000001s)]
*  actually I can't remember now, [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9207.28s)]
*  but he writes about the brain, [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9208.28s)]
*  he's a neurologist and so on, [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9209.960000000001s)]
*  and it's like, okay, so what does this mean? [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9211.2s)]
*  What is he saying? [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9214.240000000002s)]
*  And how would it be different? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9215.400000000001s)]
*  I read about people who have near-death experiences, [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9217.640000000001s)]
*  then I read Oliver Sacks' experience, [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9219.560000000001s)]
*  or you talk about in the opening [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9221.68s)]
*  of one of Sam Harris' books, [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9223.480000000001s)]
*  he talks about taking, what did he take? [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9225.160000000002s)]
*  Great. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9228.68s)]
*  I think it was LSD. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9229.52s)]
*  It might have been LSD, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9230.480000000001s)]
*  or it's just a super profound sense of love [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9231.320000000002s)]
*  for his friend there, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9233.52s)]
*  and all these really super rich experiences. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9234.52s)]
*  But he's pretty much hardcore materialist on this, [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9238.240000000002s)]
*  so I'm curious to try to see where I'd fall. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9241.12s)]
*  I'd be like, oh yeah, no, [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9243.640000000001s)]
*  this is just an interesting experience, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9244.480000000001s)]
*  it's just brain chemistry, [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9246.24s)]
*  or would I be like, maybe Graham, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9247.199999999999s)]
*  oh, there's this whole other world out there [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9249.16s)]
*  that I didn't know about. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9251.119999999999s)]
*  And here's what I'm worried about, Joe. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9252.08s)]
*  If we were having this conversation 500 years ago, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9254.0s)]
*  and somebody's telling us about dark energy [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9256.32s)]
*  and dark matter and quantum physics, [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9258.039999999999s)]
*  and we'd be going, this is bullshit, [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9259.28s)]
*  and then I don't wanna miss, [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9261.08s)]
*  oh my God, there is this other. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9262.88s)]
*  I don't think there's a danger in you doing it, [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9264.4s)]
*  so I think you should do it. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9266.84s)]
*  Because I don't think, [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9268.44s)]
*  the thing about dimethyltryptamine in particular, [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9270.88s)]
*  which is what ayahuasca, [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9273.6s)]
*  that's the psychoactive compound, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9275.880000000001s)]
*  is that it's endogenous to the human body, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9277.960000000001s)]
*  and it's one of the most transient drugs ever observed. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9281.960000000001s)]
*  Your body brings you back to baseline very quickly, [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9285.720000000001s)]
*  especially with the smoked version of DMT. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9288.32s)]
*  The oral one is different, the ayahuasca, [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9291.32s)]
*  because you're, orally, it's broken down in the gut [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9294.28s)]
*  by monoamine oxidase. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9297.08s)]
*  And so, with ayahuasca is a combinatory medication [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9299.0s)]
*  where you're taking DMT from one plant [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9303.72s)]
*  and MOA inhibitors from another plant, [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9306.44s)]
*  and that's what allows you to take it orally. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9309.32s)]
*  So it's a longer acting but less profound version [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9311.8s)]
*  in terms of the flash of DMT [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9316.88s)]
*  is so much more vibrant, apparently. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9319.8s)]
*  But it doesn't seem to be dangerous. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9322.72s)]
*  It seems like everybody who takes it comes back, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9325.96s)]
*  and yes, I've only done DMT, [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9329.519999999999s)]
*  which is the more potent version of it. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9331.279999999999s)]
*  The ayahuasca version I haven't done yet, [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9333.32s)]
*  but I'm doing it soon. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9335.24s)]
*  And that is supposed to be the long-term. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9337.24s)]
*  And the thing about the benefit of the long one [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9340.48s)]
*  seems to be that the more you can interact with that, [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9343.199999999999s)]
*  that state, the more you come back with life lessons. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9345.96s)]
*  So we'll see. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9349.64s)]
*  Well, there was something about the ayahuasca [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9350.64s)]
*  where you revisit dark memories and bad things in your life, [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9352.279999999999s)]
*  and I'm not sure I want to go through that again. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9357.12s)]
*  I don't know if that's inevitable. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9359.480000000001s)]
*  Some people haven't. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9360.480000000001s)]
*  My friend Tom just did, and he said it was all good. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9361.320000000002s)]
*  There was no bad thoughts and bad memories at all. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9363.12s)]
*  It was all beautiful. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9365.560000000001s)]
*  I think you can kind of prime your mind [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9366.68s)]
*  and prepare yourself with meditation [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9368.6s)]
*  and sort of put yourself in a good state of mind [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9370.720000000001s)]
*  when you enter into that experience. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9374.04s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9376.76s)]
*  So you do this with somebody, a guide or somebody. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9377.6s)]
*  Yes, generally, yeah. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9380.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9382.320000000002s)]
*  So here this, getting back, what is truth? [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9383.720000000001s)]
*  So if you channel your inner Jordan Peterson, [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9386.400000000001s)]
*  you say, well, it doesn't matter [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9388.560000000001s)]
*  if it affects the person's life, then it's true, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9390.880000000001s)]
*  whatever that means, that word. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9395.0s)]
*  Right? [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9396.960000000001s)]
*  See, I'm kind of locked in the kind of empiricist [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9397.800000000001s)]
*  scientific view of truth. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9399.16s)]
*  It's out there. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9400.400000000001s)]
*  It's an actual physical reality [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9401.24s)]
*  of some kind of measurable and so on. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9402.400000000001s)]
*  But what if it's not that? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9404.24s)]
*  What if truth is just, well, it matters for me. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9405.16s)]
*  I believe I have free will. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9408.68s)]
*  Maybe you're a determinist, but I don't care. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9410.92s)]
*  I feel like I'm making free choices. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9413.32s)]
*  Matters to me. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9415.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9416.36s)]
*  It's my truth. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9417.199999999999s)]
*  I don't mean this in that kind of [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9418.279999999999s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9419.48s)]
*  Postmodern way, but just maybe it is a postmodern way. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9420.32s)]
*  Yeah, the way I've described it is imagine [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9423.88s)]
*  if you could have a conversation with God, [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9427.6s)]
*  absolutely real conversation with God, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9430.16s)]
*  where you could go to a place and have a conversation [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9432.36s)]
*  with this loving, knowing entity [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9435.88s)]
*  that knows all and sees through you [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9441.439999999999s)]
*  and explains to you that we're all connected [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9445.72s)]
*  in this unseen, cosmic way. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9448.439999999999s)]
*  And if you just address that in your life [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9451.679999999998s)]
*  and treat people that way, you will live a better life. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9453.88s)]
*  And you have this brief meeting with God [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9456.839999999998s)]
*  and it's very profound. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9458.679999999998s)]
*  And then you come back and you have to sort of [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9460.119999999999s)]
*  come to grips with what you've experienced. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9464.72s)]
*  Well, that you wouldn't be able to measure either. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9467.4s)]
*  That feeling, that experience, [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9471.88s)]
*  how would you be able to prove to people [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9474.76s)]
*  that you had a conversation with God? [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9476.039999999999s)]
*  You would just have to like learn [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9478.119999999999s)]
*  from that experience yourself and somehow or another [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9480.039999999999s)]
*  try not to slip back into the human folly [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9483.0s)]
*  and all the bad behavior and thought patterns [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9487.88s)]
*  that we've all existed with. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9491.48s)]
*  Well, psychedelics in the most profound breakthrough way [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9494.16s)]
*  are like that. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9498.28s)]
*  They are like having a conversation with God. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9499.52s)]
*  And whether or not it's a hallucination [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9502.32s)]
*  or whether or not it's actually meeting [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9504.96s)]
*  and interacting with all knowing entities, [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9506.96s)]
*  the experience is the same. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9510.84s)]
*  So whether it's real or whether it's an imagination [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9512.8s)]
*  or a hallucination, the profundity, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9516.0s)]
*  the profound nature of the experience is the same. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9519.44s)]
*  So I don't know if it's real or not real. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9523.04s)]
*  Maybe that's not even the right question. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9524.880000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9526.44s)]
*  I mean, we do have a problem [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9527.28s)]
*  with wanting things to be measurable. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9528.640000000001s)]
*  Because that's how we've gotten this far. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9530.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9532.2s)]
*  We've gotten this far. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9533.04s)]
*  It works. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9534.0s)]
*  If you take 20 Tylenols, you'll be dead. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9534.84s)]
*  But if you take one, it'll fix your headache. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9537.160000000002s)]
*  Right? [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9539.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9540.720000000001s)]
*  So we're big on measuring things, which is important. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9541.560000000001s)]
*  You know how much this, this is a heavy table. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9545.240000000002s)]
*  You don't want to put it on your back. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9547.160000000002s)]
*  You know, like we have all these. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9548.640000000001s)]
*  It's measurably heavy. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9549.880000000001s)]
*  But these things are not measurable. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9551.519999999999s)]
*  And that's one of the more interesting things about them, [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9553.279999999999s)]
*  that these psychedelic experiences are not measurable [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9555.88s)]
*  and they're very personal and they're very profound. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9558.84s)]
*  And I don't think it's, [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9561.76s)]
*  I don't think it would hurt you at all. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9562.92s)]
*  I think it would help you. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9564.72s)]
*  All right, I'll do it. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9565.599999999999s)]
*  All right, we're in. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9566.619999999999s)]
*  Where is it? [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9567.46s)]
*  Right here. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9568.3s)]
*  We're gonna shut the camera off right now. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9569.119999999999s)]
*  What if that is God? [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9570.56s)]
*  What if somebody had one of these trips way back 5,000, [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9571.56s)]
*  10,000 years ago and said, I talked to God [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9574.199999999999s)]
*  and they did in their head. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9576.4s)]
*  And other people went, you know, [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9577.56s)]
*  like that Ricky Gervais movie, the invention of lying. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9578.8s)]
*  He comes out and they think he talked to God [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9582.039999999999s)]
*  and he knows and it's like, oh, [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9585.48s)]
*  cause he can't lie, right? [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9587.0s)]
*  Well, you know, that's- [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9588.16s)]
*  Maybe it's like that. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9589.0s)]
*  That's what these scholars [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9589.82s)]
*  out of the University of Jerusalem felt [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9591.88s)]
*  was the source of the burning bush, Moses. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9594.08s)]
*  They think it's the acacia tree [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9597.92s)]
*  and that the acacia tree is rich in DMT. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9599.8s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9601.92s)]
*  And they think that that's- [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9602.759999999998s)]
*  What if that triggered the whole thing? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9603.72s)]
*  Well, you know, that is also John Marco Allegro's [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9605.759999999998s)]
*  the sacred mushroom in the cross. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9609.4s)]
*  That's right, I forgot about that. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9611.2s)]
*  Yeah. Right, right. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9612.76s)]
*  And he was a scholar who was assigned [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9614.52s)]
*  to be one of the people [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9617.28s)]
*  that deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9618.12s)]
*  And after 14 years of working on it, [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9619.56s)]
*  it was his belief that the Christian religion [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9621.86s)]
*  was really initially about consumption [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9625.52s)]
*  of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9627.68s)]
*  But you know, good luck trying to decipher that [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9631.68s)]
*  and find out if he's right. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9635.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9636.36s)]
*  Yeah, so when someone like myself or Richard Dawkins says, [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9637.52s)]
*  you know, did the resurrection actually happen? [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9640.36s)]
*  Did Jesus really come back from the dead? [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9643.16s)]
*  And then you have someone like Jordan say, [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9645.6s)]
*  well, it's metaphorically true or it's mythically true. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9647.0s)]
*  And you know, people like Richard and I are like, [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9650.92s)]
*  what? What does that mean? [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9652.48s)]
*  Right, what does that mean? [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9653.48s)]
*  But to somebody who says, I believe it [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9654.32s)]
*  and it makes my life better, that's my truth. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9657.720000000001s)]
*  You know, who am I to say, no, but it's not true. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9661.4s)]
*  You know, you see where I'm going with that? [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9664.36s)]
*  These are kind of conflicting conversations [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9666.4s)]
*  I have with myself. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9667.96s)]
*  I've changed my stance on religion over the years. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9668.88s)]
*  And then I think that the real benefit is [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9672.08s)]
*  that it acts as a moral scaffolding for a lot of people. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9673.96s)]
*  And whether or not those things are true, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9678.24s)]
*  clearly, whether they're true or not, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9679.96s)]
*  whether there's the origin was actually the word of God, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9681.9s)]
*  clearly they've been affected by human beings. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9685.06s)]
*  Clearly human, I mean, when you read things in the Bible [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9688.56s)]
*  that treat women as second-class citizens [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9691.36s)]
*  and condone slavery and talk about murdering people [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9693.4s)]
*  for disobeying, clearly the work of man [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9696.76s)]
*  is involved in there somewhere. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9700.64s)]
*  Because every, and we know people are full of shit [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9702.08s)]
*  and we know that they lie in order to prop up [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9705.84s)]
*  their better interests. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9713.22s)]
*  And there's clearly some of that in religion. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9714.32s)]
*  But there's also a moral scaffolding involved in religion [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9717.48s)]
*  that seems to be very beneficial to some people. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9720.64s)]
*  Because it allows them to live their life [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9723.9s)]
*  with a structure that they think is for the greater good. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9725.1s)]
*  And a meaning structure too. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9728.3s)]
*  Yeah, and that helps them get by in life. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9730.18s)]
*  Right, yes, if you think, well, what's the meaning of all, [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9732.859999999999s)]
*  in 14 billion years there'll be no universe [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9736.82s)]
*  or whatever it is, then what's the point, right? [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9738.72s)]
*  Existential angst. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9741.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's what people feel. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9742.699999999999s)]
*  But to me, I call that, what do I call it? [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9743.98s)]
*  Who was the Woody Allen character in Annie Hall? [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9749.5s)]
*  Where he goes back as a child, he won't do his homework. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9753.46s)]
*  So his mom takes him to the psychiatrist, [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9756.5s)]
*  why won't you do your homework? [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9759.019999999999s)]
*  He says, the universe is expanding. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9759.859999999999s)]
*  What does that got to do? [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9762.58s)]
*  Well, one day the universe is gonna all blow up [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9763.42s)]
*  because it's expanding, there's no point [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9765.14s)]
*  in doing my homework. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9766.46s)]
*  And she says, what does that got to do with it? [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9767.279999999999s)]
*  You live in Brooklyn and Brooklyn's not expanding. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9769.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was a great scene. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9773.539999999999s)]
*  So, in other words, it's the wrong level of analysis. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9776.5s)]
*  You shouldn't think about your meaning of life. [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9780.46s)]
*  14 billion years, it won't have mattered what you do today. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9783.099999999999s)]
*  But it matters today to the people that you affect. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9786.259999999998s)]
*  Yes, it was interesting too [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9789.38s)]
*  that you were talking about this earlier. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9791.019999999999s)]
*  Alvy Singer, that was his character. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9792.5s)]
*  Oh, there you go. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9793.66s)]
*  You were talking about this earlier that a lot of the, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9795.06s)]
*  even the woke attitudes that people have [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9799.46s)]
*  and a lot of the progressive dogma that people talk about, [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9803.06s)]
*  it seems to be religious in nature. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9808.24s)]
*  And seems to be that we almost have like a default way [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9810.74s)]
*  of looking at certain things. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9814.94s)]
*  And then if we are atheists and we are separated [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9816.699999999999s)]
*  from this moral scaffolding [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9819.58s)]
*  that is imparted upon us by religion, [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9821.699999999999s)]
*  we'll find it in other things [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9823.88s)]
*  that we have culturally agreed upon. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9825.42s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9827.22s)]
*  So it's back to that question. [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9828.82s)]
*  Why do we have to punish people who don't accept the dogma? [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9829.66s)]
*  I mean, why would that make a difference? [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9833.14s)]
*  What do I care what you think? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9834.539999999999s)]
*  Well, it does matter because we're social. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9835.66s)]
*  And if you challenge me, that may undermine my worldview. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9838.019999999999s)]
*  So I need to stomp on that. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9843.74s)]
*  And I need you to be in agreement with me [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9846.019999999999s)]
*  because it gives me comfort. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9848.14s)]
*  Right. Right. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9849.3s)]
*  It's like there's certain people out there that, [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9850.14s)]
*  you could get that with, [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9852.019999999999s)]
*  there's people that don't like [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9853.14s)]
*  if you have an Android phone. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9854.14s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9856.179999999998s)]
*  Like you should have Apple. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9857.019999999999s)]
*  I am Apple. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9857.859999999999s)]
*  You should be Apple. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9858.699999999999s)]
*  Why don't you switch over to Apple? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9859.519999999999s)]
*  They'll try to convince you. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9860.359999999999s)]
*  There's people that'll convince you to go to AT&T. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9861.58s)]
*  Verizon sucks. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9863.46s)]
*  Why are you at the Verizon? [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9864.519999999999s)]
*  People want you to be on the same page as them [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9866.44s)]
*  with everything because it affirms [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9869.2s)]
*  that their choices were good. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9870.720000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9872.12s)]
*  You know? [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9872.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9873.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9874.68s)]
*  So we get, cause we get our truths in part socially, [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9875.52s)]
*  like other people guide us in our youth [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9878.28s)]
*  and professors and our teachers and books and experts. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9882.720000000001s)]
*  And we determine what's true in part [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9885.640000000001s)]
*  by what other people believe. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9887.32s)]
*  So you do depend on that. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9888.800000000001s)]
*  Cause none of us are smart enough [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9890.6s)]
*  to figure out the world on our own. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9891.960000000001s)]
*  So we have to have other people. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9893.34s)]
*  That's why we need communication like that. [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9894.6s)]
*  So, but the other people sometimes wrong. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9896.72s)]
*  Right? [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9897.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9898.76s)]
*  And so if our tribe believes, [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9899.58s)]
*  I call this tribal conspiracy, [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9900.68s)]
*  this is what our tribe believes. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9901.92s)]
*  This is what we do. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9903.0s)]
*  Right? [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9904.6s)]
*  And so to challenge that may make me feel like [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9905.44s)]
*  I'm not part of my tribe anymore. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9911.72s)]
*  Where's my moorings? [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9913.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9914.84s)]
*  This is my group. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9915.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9916.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9917.34s)]
*  You know? [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9918.18s)]
*  And so if you're Catholic, you believe this. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9919.0s)]
*  If you're Mormon, you believe that. [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9920.16s)]
*  If you're Jewish, you believe this. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9921.48s)]
*  And you know, that's like, [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9922.78s)]
*  I always point out to Christians who, [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9924.72s)]
*  this theologians that I debate on, [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9926.359999999999s)]
*  the resurrection really happened. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9928.16s)]
*  Here's the arguments. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9929.72s)]
*  Here's the six best arguments. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9930.56s)]
*  You know, the empty tomb and the, you know, [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9931.679999999998s)]
*  Mary was there and then the body was gone [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9933.359999999999s)]
*  and this and that and this finger in the side and whatnot. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9935.24s)]
*  Why, if these arguments are so good, [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9938.8s)]
*  why don't Jews accept Jesus as the Messiah [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9940.32s)]
*  who was crucified and resurrected? [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9942.84s)]
*  Well, if they understood the arguments, [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9944.92s)]
*  they would know that it's like, [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9946.599999999999s)]
*  they understand the argument. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9947.84s)]
*  These are smart rabbis that know a lot. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9949.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9951.679999999998s)]
*  All right. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9952.519999999999s)]
*  It's that just not, that's not their truth. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9953.36s)]
*  That's not their religion. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9956.12s)]
*  That's not it. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9957.2s)]
*  Yeah. That's the real problem with religion. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9958.16s)]
*  That there's so much variety. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9959.880000000001s)]
*  Right. So there's no way to, [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9961.84s)]
*  there's no way to like run the experiment, [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9962.960000000001s)]
*  which is the right one. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9964.68s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9965.52s)]
*  There's no experiment you can run to get, [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9966.36s)]
*  if a Martian came here and said, okay, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9967.52s)]
*  what's the right religion? [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9969.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9970.720000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9971.560000000001s)]
*  There'd be a world war to claim the proper religion [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9972.400000000001s)]
*  to express to the Martians. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9976.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9977.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9978.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9979.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9980.220000000001s)]
*  So I do think, again, if we live, you know, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9981.060000000001s)]
*  if you were chronically frozen [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9982.34s)]
*  and came back a thousand years from now [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9983.42s)]
*  and you found out all this stuff that we're talking about, [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9985.26s)]

*  These are the philosophers who think there are, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=9997.9s)]
*  our brains are just not structured [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=10000.54s)]

*  We just can't know. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=10003.98s)]

*  before the big bang, you know, [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=10007.7s)]

*  and pretending polygraph tests are real [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDgQBk1wl3M&t=10076.64s)]
