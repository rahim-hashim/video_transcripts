# Joe Rogan Experience #1496 - Colion Noir
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgxaD7u28A4)
*  Boom and we're live. Hey great to see you. Thank you for being here. Appreciate you man. I wore this just for you
*  And thank you for the gift too man. You're just pandering at this point brother. No
*  My daughter's
*  friends ex-boyfriend work for Glock. Ah, okay. Okay
*  Yeah, no, I had to get your gift man. So it's uh, it's a my life pot
*  It's like my portable safe because you know out here in California
*  You have to if you're gonna travel with the firearm, right? It has to be in a lot case, right?
*  And so when I travel out here to California, I do bring a firearm with me
*  I can't carry because you know, my license isn't recognized out here, but I can't keep a gun in like my hotel
*  And what do you have to do do like Ted Nugent can carry everywhere? Mm-hmm, cuz he's like a sheriff or something
*  Yeah, there's always you know, you have those little special licenses. Yeah, you got a you got a
*  Did you ever see that Steven Seagal show the TV show where he was a cop?
*  It's like Steven Seagal lawman or some shit, but it's a real younger when he when it came out
*  He was a real cop. Uh-huh. Like he was arresting people like you
*  He was shown up in people's houses, you know with a gun draw. They're like, are you fucking Steven Seagal?
*  Like hey, man, what's going on here? Wait, hold on. So it was like a reality show a reality show. This is it right here
*  Yeah, and he would pull people and because he was in New Orleans
*  He developed this give me some some volume on this you get to hear his accent
*  We'll get we get kicked off of YouTube if we give us involved, but you got to watch on your own
*  He developed his like see his Louisiana
*  Oh, yes, he did. Oh, yes, he did. Oh, yes, he did. It was me and my friend Tom Segura's favorite show
*  Watching his dude. So it's like he's literally running around. Yeah, we're asking people ridiculous
*  I make fun of that dude all the time and he deserves it
*  But he was a legit a keto master back that we were looking for is sitting on the ground right there
*  That's a normal accent it varies it varies widely and
*  Wildly depending upon who he's actually talking to this is surreal. Sometimes he's talking to certain folks
*  He'll put on like a deep Louisiana. So how do I open this bad boy? So
*  Is this your brand? Yes, so basically I teamed up with this company called Voltec. That's me
*  No, you're a real gun nut. We got your own
*  I think it only made sense. So how do I open this thing? All right
*  So basically there's there isn't a battery in it yet, but what you would do is you see those clamps on the side
*  Yeah, so you put the clamps on that makes it watertight. Okay, and so it's more it's a lifestyle case also lifestyle
*  Yeah, so like there are people I just did a post where somebody was on a jet ski
*  He had his like all his valuables and contents in there and because it floats. Okay. Oh, yeah
*  Yeah, so he dropped in the water anything like that. Oh, it says here the pewpewpew life
*  Get it gun people don't know what the fuck that means if you say
*  Life yeah gun people are not gonna be not excuse me. No, I'm gonna get any don't they don't they're kind of like what church
*  You mean like pews in a church right? I'm saying what does that mean?
*  Pewpew like stinky. Yeah, like I wore shirt one time and lady was like what's pewpew? What does that mean?
*  I was like guns. Oh, oh
*  People's this is one of the reasons why I contacted you I contacted you right when the looting hit
*  That's racist
*  No, because there were a lot of white people looted
*  It was a thing where I recognized that there was a giant shift in people's perception of the Second Amendment
*  And I said this is a good time for you again. Appreciate it, brother
*  Yeah
*  because you're out there beating the drums and sounding the alarms and all these people that are
*  Anti Second Amendment people were a lot of these motherfuckers that were lined up in California trying to buy a gun last minute
*  Yeah, because as soon as the lockdown hit people started getting really nervous
*  When people started getting locked in their homes and then people when they realized they weren't gonna work people started worried about people
*  Stealing and there's things along those lines
*  I heard about people getting car jacked and or getting their groceries jacked rather where they're headed to their car from the grocery store
*  Things got real weird and then you saw these giant lines at these LA gun stores
*  And that's when I got a hold of you because I think it's very it's a really important conversation
*  I think you're the best at explaining it from a very rational perspective
*  That you know people in during the times before COVID they didn't think that this was important
*  Yeah, but you were always one of those guys where it was like hey, what if shit goes down?
*  Yeah, well guess what shit went down. It's kind of like me carrying a firearm
*  You know a lot of people ask me they're like when I started carrying a gun
*  I'm like why why do you need the care gun? Like what do you think you're a drug dealer or something?
*  Look it's nothing for me to take my
*  Phones my wallet my keys and then put my gun on and go about my life
*  Yeah, and it's not much of a it's not much of an
*  Incumbrance on my life where it's like, okay, it's not worth the day-to-day of me carrying a firearm
*  But if I ever needed it
*  That's gonna be the most important thing I have on me to protect that life
*  So it's a small price to pay for something that has such a huge upside if it ever happens
*  Yeah, you're a best-case scenario though. You're you're a lawyer. You're super intelligent
*  You're a really nice guy, but you also love guns
*  Yeah, look what people are worried about is worst-case scenario
*  They're worried about someone who's a criminal who just wants to rob people who has this
*  Ultimate power over folks and that's what everybody's worried about when it comes to guns. They're worried about a school shooter
*  You know, they're worried about a mass murderer
*  They're worried about a guy who breaks into a mosque and starts gunning people down. That's what they're worried about
*  And that's I totally get it. Yeah, like I really truly honestly get it
*  I know you guys and sympathize with that
*  But my whole thing is this once we move past that understanding of so, you know, you have the best case scenario what you pointed out was
*  Directly me so to speak and then you have the worst case scenario where you have, you know criminals
*  You have crazy people mass shooters things of that nature once we get out of that realm
*  So let's talk about the reality because you know, there's overlaps, right?
*  Mm-hmm. So I usually ask people well what law you're gonna come up with that's gonna completely stop that
*  No
*  One knows now I'm not saying that because I have the absolute answer
*  but what I can tell you is this if
*  We don't know what law we can come up with that's gonna completely stop that because you can say bad
*  You can ban all the guns tomorrow. You're still gonna have crime. You're still gonna have those crazy people doing those same things
*  We have 300 million over 300 million guns in this country not going anywhere
*  You can ban them from law abiding citizens and we'd have to deal with that as it comes
*  But at the end of the day criminals are still gonna get their hands on guns
*  And so what you have to understand and accept is from a reality standpoint if you know that
*  When all the barriers that are placed to prevent these things don't work
*  the only person
*  That's gonna be able to do anything about it is you and you want the best thing possible at your disposal
*  To contend against that and that's that's what the firearm does. I'm
*  Do I glorify firearms to a degree? Yes, but that's because I'm a firearm enthusiast
*  I love them from a very practical scientific
*  engineering exactly and
*  even from a sports
*  Entertainment all of those things right? It's very holistic in that regard
*  But for people who just understanding it from a practical perspective like okay from self-defense
*  If that's the only box you want to live in perfect that makes perfect that's perfectly fine with me
*  I just have a problem where people say things like well, no one needs to have a firearm, but then you're
*  perfectly aware of all the violence and everything else that goes on in this country and you understand the limitations of the
*  First responders that we have in place to be able to prevent it
*  And if you understand that they're actually speaking you're on your own and I don't mean that from the very sadistic kind of
*  You know no way out kind of perspective, but it's just reality
*  Reality cases and we just learned and we're learning it now with the whole covert situation. Yeah, you're on your own
*  We're not just kovat right like how about I have my friend John Joseph he lives in New York City and in New York City
*  There's a there's a lot of cops that are quitting and there's a lot of crazy shit going on
*  He sent me a text message
*  He has a buddy that works in Harlem as a cop and he said there was 28 shootings in one night
*  Which is just fucking bonkers and this guy is again. He said this is New York. Yes is a Harlem
*  This is the list of all the shootings that he sent me this is his body's 21 years old and he's working
*  in
*  In Harlem keep keep in mind New York has by far some of the strictest gun
*  It's literally one of the only places that when I travel to I will not bring a gun
*  Yeah, I was gonna bring that up and then the other one I was gonna bring up a Chicago
*  Yeah, it's very similar mm-hmm in my guard. Yeah, and there's a there's a running total online
*  There's a website that shows all the shootings in Chicago in its
*  Fucking bonkers like I mean just look look at what just happened
*  Father's Day, I think it was like 102 people shot. Yeah
*  Fucking ridiculous fucking crazy and but here's his thing about that too
*  There's there's a consistency in a pattern behind these types of shootings
*  It's not even like so usually when you deal with a problem
*  First thing you do is you try to look for a pattern to see if you can figure it figure out a pattern so you
*  Yeah, and you see okay
*  What's the common denominator of all these things and then why is it and you can figure out start to figure out why it happens?
*  The idea that we're gonna create laws that's gonna stop something that's so centralized and it's so
*  It's it's there's a fundamental cause for the types of violence that we're talking about right now
*  Because they're happening in very specific areas of our country. This isn't widespread right?
*  It's not like it's like we just have this mass violence across the country on the contrary violence
*  Violent crime is actually going down if you look at it from a statistical standard
*  However, there are very their pockets within our country right that have this violence and there's consistencies within that pocket one of the big ones being
*  Gun laws not not gonna laws extreme party. Okay, you know what I'm saying
*  Is our inner cities because if you think about it it some people like to even place it based upon race
*  Right and then say okay. Well, this is a black on black violence
*  issue
*  Yeah, I can understand that but however if you really think about it think about some of the most affluent black neighborhoods in the country
*  We don't have those problems, right?
*  so what's the poverty issue exactly and it's also an issue of in
*  Chicago in particular I took a ride once I had a
*  Guy was driving us was a former cop and he was saying that they arrested a bunch of the high-level drug dealers and
*  They created a power vacuum and then it started this crazy war and then this war is just and he's like no one knows
*  How to get out of it. No one knows what to do about it
*  This is why in South Side Chicago to this day is one of the scariest spots in this entire country
*  I've done two when I was with the NRA. I did two two episodes in South Side, Chicago. Are you not with the NRA?
*  No, no, I'm not how come there the NRA and their ad agency of record had a falling out
*  massive falling out I
*  Was basically collateral damage within that so for whatever reason after the falling out
*  I haven't had contact with the NRA for almost a year. So were you working for them? I
*  Pretty much pretty much in terms of as much as say Don Lemon works for CNN. Okay, you really works for CNN
*  They give him a fat check. Yeah, that's what I mean. Well, I don't get down limit
*  I didn't wasn't getting down limit money
*  But essentially what I was doing was I was a commentator and I was a host of my show of two shows on their platform
*  Okay, that's the extent a lot of people thought I was an actual member of the NRA. Yeah, I'm still a member of the NRA
*  Yeah, okay. I thought maybe you had a falling out with the way the organization was run. No, no, it's just radio silence, right?
*  Yeah
*  I
*  The way I function I just keep I just keep moving. That's what I do smart
*  Yeah, so from that perspective, so there's no on my part. There's no there's no bad blood
*  I may have some critiques about certain things, but other than that, there's no bad blood
*  Um
*  Have you noticed a big uptick in people interested in your message? Yes. Yeah. Yeah
*  Especially a lot of people who are buying guns for the first time like I'm pretty sure you're getting to
*  Yeah, a lot of people asking if they can buy a gun. Yeah
*  And then they get a first course lesson about how the laws work
*  Yeah
*  And also like people in California that wanted to go buy a gun
*  They realized it takes a long time like you have to do a background check
*  There's a wait period and the funny thing that I used to get the biggest pushback from my
*  Defense of not having a waiting period for firearms. I
*  Used to get I used to get a lot of pushback from that because people were like well
*  At least you know gives people time to calm down and cool off. I mean that's that that's that's cartoon land thinking
*  Somebody who's made a decision to kill somebody
*  They're going to kill them or at least gonna make an attempt to do so maybe the idea that
*  That somehow not being able to buy a gun immediately to to commit that crime
*  I personally don't think it does anything
*  I don't I think if I'm if I've set out to commit some crime against someone and I go try to get a gun and I
*  Can't get a gun
*  I'm gonna try to find another avenue by which to get that tool that I need to commit that crime. Hmm, and so I
*  However on the in the alternative I can tell you actual stories about people trying to get firearms who needed them immediately
*  But couldn't get them and thus
*  Probably died as a result of it and so and I and I know other people people like I've had
*  Hell I've had girlfriends in the past who have dealt with situations with stalkers who were like, okay
*  I need I need a gun for tonight because this person showed up at my house, right?
*  You know things like that and don't you think that in order to safely?
*  You want to make sure that someone is not a dangerous violent felon before you sell them a gun
*  Absolutely, so there's got to be some kind of background check. Mm-hmm. We and we have them, right?
*  Yeah, but how long do you think you don't want to wait period?
*  No, I'm against the wait period and what is the so the logic is if like say if a woman knows that a guy is
*  Stalking her and might show up at her house tonight. She wants to be able to have a gun. Absolutely that makes sense to me
*  But there's still gonna be a background check on that girl. Yes, so so so if she were to so let's let's kind of flesh that out
*  Okay, so right now if you go and buy a gun from a dealer, right?
*  Someone who has a license to sell firearms as a business you have to have a background check, right?
*  And the background checks instant, but I think a lot of people misconstrued the the fact that the background check is instant as being insufficient
*  Okay, and that's not the case. It's just that we live in a technical, you know
*  We have technology now allows us to to conduct a background check a lot quicker than we probably would 30 40 years
*  Yeah, I bought my first gun in 94 and the background check is like by pony
*  It took a while it's a lot of paperwork, you know make sure you're not a criminal but they you know, there was no internet
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and so now with the internet, I mean, it's it's pretty pretty quick
*  Yeah, I think what people are having a problem with is the private transactions, right?
*  Right. And so generally speaking in most states
*  You don't you're not required to force someone to get a background check if you were gonna sell them a gun
*  Like if you're in a business of selling guns, then that's one thing
*  But if you're like, hey Joe, you want a gun and say you want to tell you saw one of my guns and you're like
*  I want to buy that gun right in Texas
*  I can I can meet meet with you as long as I know you're not a felon or have a reason to know that you're
*  A felon or a prohibited person of some sort. I can sell you the gun
*  So you don't have to do any kind of check? No, that's interesting now
*  I'm at Liberty to say hey Joe
*  How about you meet me at this gun store and pay for a background check?
*  On top of the price of the gun and then have a back and then conduct a background check which a lot of people do
*  a lot of us wise and so but
*  But you know, I don't like the idea that I don't like the idea of mandating private background checks, right?
*  So like if you had a friend and she had a stalker and the stalker was gonna break into her house
*  You could legally sell her a gun in Texas right there and then yeah
*  I can just give her as long as give her as long as I like I said as long as I don't know or have
*  Reason to know that she's a prohibitive
*  Prohibitive person mm-hmm other than that. Yeah, I can again
*  I bring this back to you are best case scenario like for a guy like you to have a gun
*  I don't worry about you having a gun at all
*  I think you what I'm worried about is again people that are psychotic people that are on
*  Medication people that are dangerous people that are criminals people that are thugs. That's what everybody's worried about
*  Yeah, as am I yeah as are you and when you're talking about giving your friend a gun again that that seems completely reasonable
*  You're a reasonable person. I know that if you're gonna give a gun to a person and you think they need it
*  This is gonna be a well thought out decision. Yeah, absolutely
*  So the alternative the contrary to that is what the idea that somebody who's not like that will just be giving guns away to people
*  Right exactly someone who's unscrupulous. That's the worry right now worry is someone who you know is wants to make a buck
*  And they'll sell guns to felons. Yeah, and that's already illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's illegal
*  Right. It doesn't matter if you make a look
*  Yo, what happened the government? They don't want us fucking around you want to do talking too much shit
*  That's the anti-gun lobby. They're telling they blew a fuse
*  Oh, so the video shut off should we pause for a second here
*  It's the Russians
*  Or the Chinese who do you think's attacking us that one's gone the video is going
*  I think so
*  We're gonna hold hold folks. Hopefully nothing will happen here, and they won't think that
*  Everything like what?
*  Okay, well let's turn everything back on just in case we'll just pause it ladies and gentlemen something happened
*  There was some sort of a power surge, so we're just positive or sexy. We'll come back. All right. We're back
*  So something happened folks. Sorry. We had some sort of a power surge
*  All the lights went out for a second and pop back on it was like a pop
*  I know we don't know what never have that happened before
*  It's the fucking Russians or the Chinese or the I don't know man. I've been that but I've been having some weird things happen
*  On my end, so I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah, that was I was gonna ask you that do you feel like
*  Because you have this pro Second Amendment message. Do you think people fuck with you because like
*  You're a like if I was someone who had an anti-second amendment message
*  You're the biggest nightmare a lawyer who's a friendly guy
*  Good-looking articulate really good at media
*  You're always doing things and you have a passion for these guns you talk about them like you you did this thing
*  We were walking around as a bunch of tires around you like smile. I love this guy
*  And you're shooting it you're talking and like that motherfucker loves guns like this isn't a joke
*  Loves guns like this isn't a joke
*  You love guns the way I love muscle cars or bows or you know you're I mean I love guns, too
*  You know what you know what the funny thing is you know what I love slightly more than guns what cars do you yeah?
*  What kind of cars?
*  I'm more into like the the the vanity superficial level of cars like like Astin's
*  Ferraris Porsches and things of that nature yeah, that's my that's my that's more my heart really thumps. Yeah
*  I'm into cars that make me feel yeah, like I feel so
*  like
*  Manual and transmissions you know I consider it so my favorite brand is Aston Martin
*  It's great car, and so I consider that the English muscle car
*  mmm
*  Because largely they are they all the sensorial effects that you get from an American muscle car generally speaking with a little bit more
*  Refinement you get from Aston Martin's, but then they also go wrong and they also lose value incredibly
*  Yeah
*  Go wrong part yeah, Dane Cook was telling me about that
*  He said is he had an Aston Martin it fell apart, but my friend Brendan Schaub has one right now
*  And he loves it which one you know what is that?
*  It's dope whatever it looks like a spaceship. It's pretty slick. I love them man
*  They they evoke an emotional response out of me more than any other generally speaking any other car. It's British
*  Yeah, I don't trust British. I don't trust my people Italians can fuck off. I'm never buying one of your cars you fucking animals
*  Make pizza and paintings that's supposed to be making cars well man. They have a lot of character, brother
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, no I love Ferraris. They are gorgeous. I mean I'm so stupid. I might buy one one day
*  I think you should be that stupid yeah
*  They they do man the funny thing is I'm not even like a
*  I'm in like I remember I went to exotic racing in Vegas
*  Yeah, it's like my first time ever driving a race car around driving a car around the track like that
*  And I got to drive pretty much anything I wanted and the car walked away from that was like I mean anywhere from like a Ferrari
*  Pista to a 911 GT3 and the car that I walked away from like yeah
*  It was actually the Porsche 911 GT3. Yeah, we're talking about a three four hundred thousand dollar car
*  Versus a hundred and thirty hundred fifty thousand dollar car
*  Yeah
*  the GT3
*  Evokes an emotional response because of the this the interaction that you have with the vehicle was it a manual or it wasn't a manual
*  It was a PDK well if you want to drive fast the PDK is the way to go the manuals really better for a street car
*  Yes, you know when you're on a track you want to keep your hands on the wheel and just bam bam
*  You know so you don't miss shifts and things of that nature
*  But yeah when you are on the street that level of engagement between shifting gears in a car
*  It you can't there's nothing that can only thing I think that may be able to replicate that to a degree is working a bolt action
*  On a rifle. Mmm, and I know it's not so you say yeah. Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah, there's a
*  Yeah, boom or even like or even like a lever action. Mm-hmm like that that same thing is just this
*  It's just like this. It's like a combination of the mechanical and organic that just kind of comes together and it's just beautiful
*  Do you know that in the hunting world?
*  There's like a dispute between the hunting world and the tactical world and the gun enthusiast world and they call the hunting world
*  Elmer fun. Yeah, and what's ironic is the new Warner Brothers they cut out the gun
*  There's a new remake of Elmer Fudd. Now. This is where it gets crazy folks
*  Elmer Fudd who's always been hunting Bugs Bunny now. He's hunting Bugs Bunny with a sight
*  Which is
*  Being a shit. It's the
*  You're like even like it literally made me go. Oh shit
*  Like if Elmer shoots Bugs Bunny with a shotgun, at least he dies quick
*  Sife you're hacking away man. You're just
*  And he's still allowed to use dynamite. They're still using dynamite. So they're using explosives, but they can't use a firearm anymore
*  I actually did a video on it. Did you yeah?
*  Yeah
*  One of the writers basically said his justification for it was you know during the time and they were working on the actual cartoon it
*  Happened really close to the Vegas shooting and so they're like everyone immediate wanted to stay away from God
*  So I'm like but the scythe and explosions are okay. Look at this. Give me give me a let me play some of this
*  Just like a look at it. Can you?
*  But just have it in the background just like it I just want to see what this looks like when he's running around with a site
*  Oh
*  There's something weird man about
*  redoing the past
*  You know looney tunes, so this is a new version right? This is completely new
*  It's not like they took the gun out. Oh my god. This is so weird
*  the sight ah
*  It's so sick and he sticks a stick a dynamite in his mouth
*  And he blows his fucking face off. That's okay. I
*  Mean what is first of all what kind of fucking shitty dynamite? I know right that's the worst lesson
*  You're teaching kids no dynamite safety because dynamite just makes your face dirty for a second and then and then it comes back to normal
*  Look even his hat regenerates like what the fuck are we teaching kids?
*  There's no consequences to dynamite there is a curtose use of dynamite in this one
*  Look at this, but look at how crazy is the dynamite blows his hat apart, but then it fixes itself
*  Look at this boom and again boom and again boom and again boom. This is a bit excessive
*  He lands oh finally his hats fucked up will it stay fucked up. Let's see. Let's see. It's fucked up. He's dancing
*  He's got no hat
*  Boom, then he gives him a cake with dynamite and it says coming soon. That is the dumbest shit
*  God that's so weird. I think it would've been ten times better with a gun, but it doesn't make any sense
*  So weird but I
*  I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist. I'm not
*  But sometimes I like I look at stuff like that and I look at the decision behind
*  Why they remove the firearm and I hear you the whole Vegas thing and you know sensitivity to it
*  But I'm like but but your alternative was just as or if not more violent
*  Than the than than a gun so my mind goes. Okay. This is more of a cultural thing
*  right, I think I think there's an attempt to be made to
*  Erase the idea of firearm ownership in this country because I think there are large a lot of people like me like we grew
*  Up even though I didn't grow up with firearms. I still grew up with an understanding of the Second Amendment
*  I was I was taught about the Second Amendment to a certain degree in school
*  I guarantee they're not teaching about the Second Amendment schools now know that I can assure you know
*  Yeah, if anything, I mean there's definitely no positive message. No, so what it tells me is
*  I
*  Am assuming the demographic of people that are gonna be watching that or large would be largely you and I who kind of grew up
*  With it in the past for the nostalgia effect
*  But then also a new generation of kids are gonna be watching that as well
*  And we all grew up with Elmer Fred having the the shotgun
*  Yeah, he's the hunter with the shotgun and very quiet. I'm hunting rabbits. But see here's a funny thing about that
*  You know when it comes to the the issue of firearms and we in the gun debate in this country
*  By like you get people like Joe Biden talking about you know, all you need is a shotgun
*  You don't you don't need an AR-15 shotgun shock who needs an AR-15 for hunting. Yeah, you cast eyes
*  Elmer Fudd and you take away his shotgun
*  What is that? What is that saying? Well, it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't it doesn't make any sense
*  And Joe Biden's message doesn't make any sense either because shotguns have a very limited range, you know
*  It's also it's it's it's you know
*  If someone's like on your property breaking in and shooting at you from a distance or something shotguns
*  Yeah, it's not gonna do much of anything, but I think that's the point
*  It's well, it's also like this
*  It's not true that people don't hunt with them people will hunt with ARs all the time particularly pigs
*  You know, that's a that's another debate in the hunting world about bolt action versus semi-automatic
*  And that you know, especially when people hunt pigs like in Texas you're dealing with a massive pig infestation
*  And when they hunt these wild pigs they like to use guns they could fire more than one round
*  There's a video of me right now on on YouTube where I was hunting
*  I was hunting hogs at night with an AR. Yeah, and and the funny thing is a lot of it too for me. I
*  Mean we have cougars in Texas
*  So people don't think about that component so I may be hunting one animal but there may be another animal hunting you exactly
*  And I don't want to have to deal with the bolt action rifle
*  Possibly deal with that threat fuck that right like I was a new I was in New Mexico
*  Not too long ago and I was just kind of one of my friends has a huge property out there called the Q
*  Ranch and I was driving around this property and
*  Just kind of exploring a little bit and I took an AR with me because he does have bears and things like that on his property
*  I don't want to run or I don't want to run into something that could kill me with the with the bolt action shotgun
*  Yeah, I want an AR because it's effective at allowing me to defend myself more effectively
*  Yeah, and I think that's where other people a lot of people don't realize that they just see the they see the AR and they
*  Say oh my god, it looks scary. It looks dangerous and they assume what a bad guy can do with an AR towards you
*  They never really see themselves empowered to utilize the AR to defend themselves
*  And I think that's the way they want the conversation to be in this country is to perpetually see yourself as a possible victim
*  Yeah, now the irony is to a degree. I'm doing the same thing
*  I'm saying have an AR so they in the event that somebody tries to make you a victim you can defend yourself
*  Right. The only difference is one of one of the conclusive aspects of what I'm saying is
*  Empowering the other is depend on me and give me art and put all of your safety in my hands
*  I EV of the government right and I'm just not with that
*  Well, and also we're realizing that the people that you put your hands into they're they're humans and they're severely flawed
*  Yeah, I mean that's what we're realizing
*  Across the entire country right now and that's what the people forget
*  I think people tend to add this kind of autonomous
*  Godlike aspect to the government. Well, we'd like that to be the case
*  We'd like the government to be the big daddy that's gonna if we dial 9-1-1, they're gonna take care of everything
*  Yeah, but honestly, that's probably not the case. What's not the case right now in Atlanta? No, it's going on
*  I'm just not responding. Yeah, and it's a huge huge reality dose
*  Yeah, we got a lot of messages from people
*  From cops that think that I had a bad take on the Atlanta case because the guy
*  Stole the stuff he stole a taser and then they shot him and they you know
*  What they were saying to me is essentially that this guy had a criminal history and that just because someone is being compliant
*  Doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have an evil intentions
*  They're just they're just waiting to do something and then this guy got in a tussle with the cop
*  I understand what they're saying. But given the current climate
*  Shooting a guy with a taser that doesn't work, you know, cuz that's Jamie. That's the case, right? The taser didn't work
*  As they said it already been fired twice so it means it it's done do we know that for a fact
*  So I read can we pull that up just in case because we are talking on a podcast that millions of people gonna hear
*  I don't want anybody to misunderstand me. I I have two positions one. I think
*  It's really hard to be a cop
*  Really really really fucking hard to be a cop and I think the defunding of the cops is a terrible idea
*  I think they need way more money and I think they need training and I had Jaco willing gone
*  Who's a former Navy SEAL and he was a commander and he would he would set up testing and he would set up training rather and
*  That's what they need. They need constant training Jaco was saying he thinks they should be training 20% of the time
*  Yeah, I mean I honestly probably train a lot more than a lot of cops
*  I bet you trained way more than most cops and then I would always be really shocked in
*  Jiu-jitsu class when cops would come in where they were they had nothing
*  Experiencing that nothing like they literally didn't know what to do in a hand-to-hand fight. I'm like man. This is crazy
*  Yeah, here it goes. We have concluded that Rolf was aware that the taser in Brooks possession
*  It was fired twice. Once it's fired twice. It presented no danger to him or to other persons
*  Okay, one thing you could say is it maybe he forgot that is possible that he forgot
*  He saw the taser being pointed at him, but it also says he shot him in the back two times
*  He was running away from him. So the part the shooting it I think the shooting in the back
*  Yeah is not as relevant as people make it. He says Howard said the office concluded the time of Brooks death
*  He did not pose a threat to the officers
*  He said Brooks was running away from the officers when when Rolf shot him in the back two times
*  That I that I agree with that the shooting in the back
*  I don't think is as important because people move well also in the video from what I saw now
*  I could be wrong Courtney might correct me if they see this when I saw him in the video
*  So it makes it stands to reason he's firing on him
*  He's gonna get hit in the back, right?
*  If they knew that the taser had been fired twice, that's a different story
*  You can prove that he knew the taser if he for me you can prove that the taser you can prove that he had knowledge
*  That it was a taser
*  That it already been fired and was unoperable at that point then yeah that then we're talking and was aware of it
*  Well, it was very good. We're exactly people panic right?
*  They really do and you there's things that happen to people in high-pressure situations that you you can't attribute
*  Normal thinking to them in high-pressure pressure situations. I've had somebody also because I've had multiple conversations
*  So when stuff like this comes out, I don't I hadn't I haven't talked about this because I don't think it's a gun issue
*  So I don't talk about it on my channel
*  But I do have these conversations at NOSM at you know personally and so I talked to different people who I know will have
*  Different perspectives one thing somebody pointing out to me was the idea that like you talked about in the moment
*  With the adrenaline being pumped and then you have the tunnel vision all that stuff that's going on
*  There is a sort of kind of a reactive nature to hearing the sound of pop going off
*  And then a cop possibly thinking that he was shooting the gun that was that's that's one theory
*  So does the taser pop even though it been fired twice from what I'm from what I'm told it does
*  It'll still pop it may not be effective or disperse anything, but it'll pop it still make the noise. Yeah. Oh, well, there you go
*  And so I think that's that changes things if that if that happened, but even still
*  And then the current climate it's just it's yeah, there's a there's a it's it's hard man because he's like you're right
*  It's like do we now expect the cops to be politicians as well?
*  Well, we also expect them to be superhuman in their ability to function under pressure exactly with very little training
*  That's that's that problem. That's a huge problem that I think a lot of people realize a lot of people think that
*  Cops are just these these wizards with firearms and a lot of them are not and a lot of it is due to the fact that
*  A lot of these departments don't have enough money to train them adequately exactly. Yeah, it's old like
*  Cops that I know personally they go I go to courses
*  Training courses and these cops are there paying for it themselves. Yeah, it's not even like they're you know, like that like the
*  The department sent them there or they're subsidizing their training now
*  They're there by themselves paying for the month paying their own money to go to these training courses so that they can be
*  More proficient and better at firearm handling safety so forth and so on
*  So when I was saying I have two positions my one position is that I think cops need way better training
*  It should be a higher priority for us to have like elite people like Navy SEAL
*  caliber people as police officers and people that are trained to diffuse situations and people are trained and also people that live in the
*  Community and people that have a relationship with people in the community so that there there's more of an investment
*  I do you want better do me one better. I say the entirety of our nation
*  Needs to be better trained on firearms
*  We have over 300 million guns in this country
*  There's absolutely no reason why we should have so many people not versed and have the knowledge necessary to own and operate a firearm
*  Safely, so you're one of those people like a well-armed society is a polite society. Yes. I am yeah
*  There's an argument for that. I mean and the alternative is what right? You know to me
*  It's we are a well-armed society period, but I think we need to be better educated
*  Yeah, and I think the time we spend on a national stage arguing and debating gun control
*  We have three we have over 300 federal gun laws on the books. We have over 22,000 on the state and local levels
*  We've we're past the point of gun control laws solving these issues
*  I think where we're at now is the same way we want to teach kids about sex at a certain age
*  We because it's a net, but it's inevitable. It's the same thing with firearms
*  You're going to interact you're gonna come across a gun at some point in your life in this country
*  And so as a result of that we should be talking about all right, maybe maybe we subsidize the idea of mass
*  distribution of knowledge with respect to firearms use and teaching people to be
*  Responsible gun owners so as to create a culture that looks at firearms one from under the guise of the Second Amendment
*  But also knowing how to operate them safely and responsibly
*  It's so funny because people in this they have this contradiction, right?
*  They're part of them does not want that because they don't want to encourage
*  Firearms because they think that'll create more firearms, but I
*  See your point to that it would the firearms already exist
*  And at least this will give people an understanding of the safe way to use them the proper way to use them
*  Yeah, I mean
*  That's people have guns and they've never even fired exactly and now think about all of the new gun owners now
*  Think about all the people who went out and panic by I don't like saying it but it's truth
*  Yeah, they went out and they panic bought a gun that they really don't know how to use
*  Yeah, and so now what's let so who but see who has to pick up that slack us in the gun community
*  So now people like me and other content creators how are now?
*  We're scrambling trying to create videos to teach people what they need to be doing in order to use and operate that firearm safely
*  Because right now we have a culture in a society that is so anti-gun
*  We rather try to scare people away from guns instead of teaching them how to use them safely even though we have a Second Amendment
*  Which allows us to own and operate these firearms? That's so crazy
*  And so yeah, and I so crazy is you people have to go to your Instagram page to be educated in how to but
*  But there's good in that too because you do have a large following on Instagram
*  And a lot of people are gonna go and they're gonna learn some things from those videos if I'm not shadow man
*  Are you feeling are you sure? Yeah, I get man
*  Brother it's it's bad. I and then I I can tell you my business partner here right now. We talked about that
*  Telling you saw what our numbers were before in terms of who we were able to reach
*  Yeah, and what they are now
*  Yeah, that's weird too, it's weird because like you're not doing anything illegal everything is responsible
*  Everything is intelligent and you're you're clearly well educated on the subject both in the arguments against gun use in the Second Amendment
*  And also the correct way to use them. Let me play devil's advocate against myself
*  Okay, because and it's based on something you said could very well be the fact that they
*  They may see that aspect of me right and other people like me, but they don't have the same faith in other people
*  You get what I'm saying? So they don't want the information disseminated out there to those people who they feel may not be as
*  Safe I think you're thinking of it too kindly what I think is there's a left-wing
*  Perspective on guns guns equal bad. Yes now that I'm aware. Yeah, I'm just trying to get our
*  guns bad
*  Mm-hmm all those guns equal bad, you know, I mean this is just it's a really unfair
*  I was told that too when I put up some videos from Tarrant tactical people like oh you're gonna get shadow ban like really
*  For for responsible use of guns in a place where they taught John wick
*  You would think that would not be the case but now do I think you're in danger be shadow ban
*  No, because that's not what that's not what your channel or you know
*  Mine is is about firearm ownership not to not to mention
*  I was the guy who was part of the NRA who was with the NRA at some point
*  So that doesn't give me any brownie points in that regard, but by and large. Yes, I am
*  Shadow if you take a look at
*  Now things have gotten a little bit better, but I don't think it's but I don't think it's from them loosening things
*  I think it's more people are sharing my content because there's nothing the algorithm can do about that
*  Right if you see a video and you share it, there's nothing they can do about well
*  Let's tell everybody your your Instagram handle right now. They're on this
*  Coley on the war co li o n and in oir. Okay. Yeah, and so everybody know
*  Yeah, you're like, how do I get to you don't have to search?
*  Just Google it and it pulls all everything. Yeah, and because some people might be just on this clip and you go
*  Well, I want to go back and listen to the whole podcast
*  It's it sucks man. It sucks because it is a legal thing
*  And you have a real like like if anybody has a legitimate intelligent argument for the pros of gun ownership and and
*  You know ethical use of guns and correct use. It's you. I mean you're the best at it. You're online
*  I mean which will beg to probably the reason why they probably want to shut me up to
*  It's I don't like when people are telling other people what to and not to do and it's based on their own personal ideology
*  I don't like it. I don't like it at all either because I'm very much of look you do what you want to do with your
*  Life as long as it doesn't interfere with mine or step on any of my my rights. We're good. How Texas of you?
*  Texas through it through brother. I have Texas born and raised. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great place
*  so
*  This this is my two positions that I was saying before so number one position
*  I am
*  100% in favor of law enforcement and I think they need to be better trained and I think you need to get rid of those bad
*  Motherfuckers, I think there's a lot of them. I think there's a lot of bad cops
*  You need to get rid of those and I gotta get this off because this is something that pisses me off a little bit
*  That is a nuanced perspective
*  However on social media and in general the idea of having a nuanced perspective on a particular issue
*  It's so far gone now. Yes that you can't even really have a conversation. I can say in one breath. I am pro cop
*  Yeah, I am pro cop. I have a lot of friends who are cops
*  However, there are also a good number of them who are evil as fuck probably racist and need to be fucking dissolved from
*  Murderers yes, and yes for some reason it's either
*  Nope, either all cops are bad or they're all good and that's what I can't get down with
*  Yeah, I just can't you can't get down with that and I'm with you
*  I think we can also say in one breath. I'm pro cop, but I'm also pro these peaceful protests
*  Yeah, I think these peaceful protests are important and there was some I mean
*  Maybe I did a bad job of explaining what I was trying to say
*  But whatever basketball player was mad at me the other day
*  Because it was something I said that I think a lot of these people are fighting like an invisible enemy when they're when they're protesting
*  What I mean by that is
*  Yes, we need bad cops. Yes cops should start shooting
*  Whether it's black people or white people or anybody wrong people because people love to I remember our last our last segment
*  We made a mistake verbally and people jumped on it. You said we need bad cops. Did I say that? Yeah
*  That I really imagine saying how dumb we need bad cops. We need cops. We need good cops
*  But there and there's definitely bad cops and bad cops that shoot people
*  Whatever race they are are fucking terrible. Clearly. There's a problem with cops shooting black people. Yeah, clearly. There's also
*  statistically not even just shooting people if you look at the see if you look at the
*  Death statistics for cops and black people. There's a thing that people like to do where they say well
*  Actually cops shoot more white people than black people. There are more white people
*  And but the other thing that I think is as important if not more important is cops are
*  Physical with black people more than they are white people cops are physical with brown people Mexicans Puerto Ricans
*  They're they're physical with them more than they are white people statistically by as much or more than 25% there is a problem
*  Also
*  There's a problem with people that don't know what they want. They just think that getting defunding the cops are bad
*  This is what I meant by fighting an invisible enemy. I just did a shitty job explaining it
*  to you the thing we should want is a
*  safe community
*  Including people that get pulled over by cops. Yeah, so that's the one thing that needs to be addressed first, right?
*  Get rid of the bad cops fund them better train them better
*  Yeah, and we should we should all want this this shouldn't this defund the cop shit. It's crazy
*  I think a lot of its movement has been co-opted by
*  And I always always hesitate because I like I said, I'm not conspiracy theorist, but I have to call spade to spade
*  There are a lot there are a lot of subversive there's a subversive group in this country that wants to topple the current structure of the
*  United States. Yeah, so that they can gain power because they think they can rule better. Yeah, and a lot of those people
*  Generally speaking our Marxist. Yes, that's pretty much it
*  They're the that's why like I make a delineation people ask me about black lives matter for instance
*  Black lives matter the sentiment I can get down with black lives matter the organization
*  I cannot and why is that because they are not for the same thing
*  So what do you think the the leader that the founders of black matter like the founders of black lives matters literally just came out
*  Basically said she's a trained Marx. She didn't basically said she said blatantly. She's trained Marxist
*  She's both of them the founders of black lives matter the organization
*  These are the same marks. It's two folks that went on stage with Bernie Sanders at one time
*  I believe so don't quote me on that and took the mic from him
*  Whoever the two women are who are who are the founders of black lives matters the organization?
*  They are trained Marxist said it with their own mouth on the show and what so what is their goal?
*  What do they want? Well, what do Marxist want?
*  They want to topple the current structure
*  They utilize they have they have their use so speak their useful idiots that create that create chaos
*  To topple whatever structures in place so that they can come in fill the vacuum and then what did they do with the useless chaos?
*  What did they do with the useful idiots?
*  They dispose of them because they are rebellious and nature and thus will topple the power structure that's in place then
*  So who are the useful idiots that you think they are utilizing the people running around spraying black lives matters
*  while
*  Riding and looting. Yes, not protesting right but writing and looting. That's the distinction
*  Mm-hmm, and this is what I did a shitty job explaining. There's a lot of people that are out there protesting
*  I don't necessarily think they understand what like what needs to be done
*  What needs to be done to keep us safe is not defunding the police
*  Need to be done. They need to go through the fucking police department with a fine-tooth comb and every one of these motherfuckers
*  It has multiple complaints. Just get rid of them
*  Yeah, just get rid find out what the fuck is going on
*  Yeah, if the multiple complaints don't make sense, then leave them alone
*  Yeah
*  But find out like that guy that guy that killed that guy and look for anybody who could do that to a person who can lean
*  On a person's neck like that for eight minutes something's fucking wrong with you
*  Something's fucking wrong with you and you should have never been a cop in the first place and we all know that there are people like that
*  When you talk to people that are in the military
*  There are folks that they have to work with that are fucking sociopaths
*  Yeah
*  And they hope that Bud's training and that seal training is gonna weed those guys out of that ranger training or whatever
*  Whatever the fuck it is that they have to do
*  But it doesn't always doesn't always and sometimes they get in a situation and Jocko was talking about how you'll get an entire
*  seal team that they have to disband and re and
*  Reset up because they have bad leadership
*  And so you did these same guys and they come in with good leadership and they get trained correctly and it turns around
*  And it turns out you know look if we if we join some sort of a military group and you're being led by some
*  Fucking piece of shit commander. What do you do?
*  Where do you go and your faith in the whole entire organization is fucked? Yep
*  So a lot of this stuff is top-down
*  So you have a lot of these cops that are in these bad neighborhoods and they've been dealing with corruption for there's a there's a movie called
*  the seven five and it's about the 75th precinct in New York and
*  Michael Dowd who is one of the guys in the movie was a bad cop yeah, and he's out now
*  And he did time and shit like that, but it's a fucking crazy movie
*  And I had him on the podcast but his first day on the job
*  Didn't they throw a dude off a balcony or some shit like that. He was told to shut his mouth
*  Something happened like first day on the job. He witnessed some crazy shit, and they were he was basically told hey motherfucker
*  This is how we do shit I get all that fucking goody two-shoes drag-net bullshit out of your head
*  Yeah, this is how we do things here
*  And so then you're indoctrinated into this force that's already compromised
*  I think that's where a lot of people kind of
*  That's why I think a lot of people come from when they talk about the systemic aspect of yes
*  Yes, it's it's that culture that breeds the mentality that says all right
*  This is the way things are gonna be done so you either you either get you get out or you lay down right right?
*  And so that and so in a lot of that that responsibility is born on the leadership in these places
*  Yes, and that's what needs to happen there needs to be a restructuring a reorganization of the leadership from a top-down perspective
*  That I do believe and I agree with you
*  I'm like you got a guy who has multiple multiple complaining mean at a certain point where there's smoke
*  It's probably gonna be some fire somewhere
*  Yes
*  And so at that point if you can't really reasonably justify why this person is getting a lot of complaints
*  And it like you said if it doesn't make sense why they're getting a plane done, okay cool
*  But if you're like, all right, this just seems real suspect
*  Yeah, either do a deeper investigation of it or get rid of them
*  Yeah, and there's a problem with most people when you give them ultimate power over someone else and it's not just the power of having
*  A gun it's the power of being able to tell someone do what I'm telling you to do
*  There's a crazy video
*  I watched the other day of a white guy pulling over another white guy and
*  He's telling the guy get out of the car and the guy's why do you want me to get out of the car?
*  He goes cuz I'm fucking telling you to get out of the car and he pulls out his pepper spray and he goes hey
*  Man, he goes I'm going I'm speeding. I'm going five miles an hour over it goes stop filming
*  He goes I don't have to stop filming and he goes and why you pointing your fucking pepper spray at me?
*  And he goes if you don't get out of the car
*  I'm gonna hit you with it
*  And so this is back and forth with this guy and he goes to hit it he goes it's out
*  You're lucky. This is your lucky day goes. No, he goes you're fucking crazy
*  He's like you're gonna pepper spray me because I'm going five miles an hour over the speed limit
*  So this is an example of a person who should never be in a position of having ultimate power over someone like that
*  He said if a guy was a really good cop was a veteran. He would have been able to defuse a situation
*  He would have walked up to him. How you doing, sir?
*  You know why I pulled you over you're going a little bit faster
*  You're going five miles an hour over the speed limit blah blah blah whatever it was
*  Yeah, you don't point fucking pepper spray at a guy just just cuz he's filming you when he's filming you he's allowed to do that
*  Mm-hmm. That's you you this is like an audition for you to keep your job. Yeah, that's what it is
*  Like do a good job right there
*  Because you're you're gonna get on the internet right now and there's a lot of people that are on the internet
*  There was a fucking horrible one that I watched where this guy was in this
*  Verbal altercation with this woman and it wasn't heated she didn't do anything wrong and he's he's yelling
*  She's not listening so he grabs her rag dolls her to the ground face plants her and gets her in a rear naked choke
*  and he's screaming at her and these other and he's a terrible rear naked choke too and these other people are standing by watching this and
*  filming it and
*  It's fucking madness. Yeah, this is a terrible way to handle the situation
*  Just a person who's either got PTSD or he's all fucked up and my buddy Joe
*  She's a shitty person just a shitty person who happens to get this job now. Guess what? Here's the other problem
*  Who's gonna be a cop now? Yeah, that's the thing who's gonna be a cop now. I might be honest with you
*  I wouldn't want to be a cop. I wouldn't be I want to be a cop now fuck man
*  No, can only imagine but that I think the problem is it's like people don't understand like the relationship between community and
*  Police should be a symbiotic relationship
*  That's that's what it should be. Yes, because even the same to the same degree there needs to be training
*  I think there needs to be training not mandated training, but people should be on a cognizant
*  Especially if I as a gun owner. Yeah, someone who carries a gun on me 99% of the time in my car on my body on my person
*  I should understand the dynamics that a police officer is looking at me from and
*  Dealing with people who carry guns and vice versa
*  So the officer needs to be understand and be aware of the fact that okay
*  You're living in a population where people carry firearms
*  So the idea or the presence of a firearm in the hands of civilians should not terrify you that much
*  It just shouldn't now I get it
*  There are bad apples all over the place thus that brings it full circle
*  Me as a citizen should understand that because there are certain people who are bad apples who carry
*  Firearms that are interacting with the cops and maybe they may want to do ill will towards the cops
*  That I as a citizen should understand and have the responsibility that says all right
*  There are certain things I'm going to do whenever I'm interacting with the cop that signals to them. Hey, I don't mean you no harm
*  I mean, you know threat I get pulled over I
*  Knit the first thing I do is I pull over roll the windows down
*  I have my ID and I have my my concealed carry license in hand, right?
*  Everything I'm doing is just to put the cop at ease, right? I'm demonstrating to cop look
*  I understand you don't know who I am. I don't know who you are
*  So we're gonna give each other this mutual respect that says all right as long as you respect me
*  I'm gonna respect you and
*  generally speaking
*  Don't this I speed a lot
*  I
*  Have it's like 50-50
*  Yeah
*  50-50 is a lot. It is a lot actually and the funny thing is the best time was I was in a car at the time
*  I was I was in the car with
*  with my ex at the moment she was my girlfriend my then girlfriend and one of her best friends and we were driving back from
*  Houston and so I was speeding and so I think I think I like a m6 at the time and so I was speeding and
*  Slow down
*  So go go and then I get pulled over and then I get pulled over and they're laughing they're like, haha
*  We told you you idiot. Ha ha ha ha ha and so I'm sitting there and I'm like
*  I got egg on my face and shit and cop comes over and he's like he's like, yeah, you know
*  I'm getting you know, I do what I normally do all the windows down hand in my driver's license
*  He goes he goes to the runs my information. He's like
*  You know, there might be a weird question, but you know, are you are you calling on the wire? I was like, yeah
*  He's like, oh man, I thought it was well
*  This is why it's a question because your ID is different because your real name my real name is Collins
*  Yeah, right, but do you give out your real name? I give out my real first name
*  I don't give out my last name because I don't want to have to shoot anybody
*  I'm being dead serious. I mean I get I get a lot of weird stuff
*  So I'm sure yeah, and I don't I mean look if you want to find my real name
*  You can find you pull up on Wikipedia, right?
*  But I don't want to make it easy for you
*  But I mean if you want to have those problems, let's I mean have at it but and and I could have had people threaten me before
*  What over what just my stance and things like that?
*  I've had people threatening you for your stance on responsible gun ownership. They want to shoot you. I don't understand. It's so rude
*  It's so ridiculous. I don't understand it, but you have but I mean there are a lot of psychos out there
*  Yeah, and even anti gunners can be psychosis
*  Anti gunners can be psychosis
*  I've had this conversation about you with people that are not gun owners that don't like guns and I said listen
*  There are people out there like yourself
*  That are the best example of what you would hope for a gun owner
*  And if you're if that's your fucking neighbor, you should be happy that that guy's armed some shit goes down
*  You need someone to help you. You want people to be able to help themselves, but I think in my neighborhood
*  Think people are gonna have a different attitude about this with all this defund the police talk
*  I really do and the looting and the run and and not only that but here in Santa Monica
*  They have police right the police are there and they were told to stand down
*  They were told to stand there while people are looting. I think another thing too. I think there is a
*  semantics
*  Issue going on with the defund the police at least from what I'm seeing because initially when I heard about the defund the police
*  What the hell are talking about like we can't be this stupid. I
*  Guess there is a segment. It's even within the defund the police. There are different sex
*  there are the people who are like no, we just need to reallocate certain portions of the funding for police in different places and
*  Then there are people who are like no we just need to absolve all police
*  Take away the funding and get rid of those people are out of the fucking
*  Here's a funny thing about that. Let's take what's going on in Seattle. Mm-hmm. Yeah in Chas. Yeah
*  How fast do we realize within a blink of an eye that
*  Crime is gonna happen. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what type of utopia you think you're gonna establish
*  They were going to be messed up people. Well, someone got shot there yesterday being in it and from what I hear it was pretty much
*  A hit was it I think not the one from yesterday but the one before that cuz there was another shooting
*  Oh, and apparently it seemed like it was a hit like they were looking for this person and they went to kill them and I'm like
*  You were supposed that Chas was supposed to be this utopia right no cops
*  No money all of it and within a blink of an eye. What do you have?
*  Well, no, it'll fly. They also don't have hospitals in Chas
*  All right, like what are you gonna do if someone does get shot?
*  Well, apparently somebody bled out because because the cops probably don't want to go in there. Yeah, well, they wouldn't let him in
*  Oh when I saw yeah, and so it's not gonna end well folks. It's not it's not gonna end
*  Well, the the way to handle this in my opinion is to fix the turn the current structure
*  To do it in a logical way that makes sense
*  Yeah, it's not to take everything down. So to take this back to what you were saying about black lives matter
*  Don't you think there's probably people in black lives matter who don't have these sort of Marxist ideas?
*  They just don't want black absolutely
*  Absolutely the sentiment of black lives matter. I am all for it. I'm on yeah, I'm all for it the organization though
*  That's the problem I have because they're essentially the leadership of this so you think that the leadership has I think
*  Secret motive that the people that are involved that are doing all the groundwork probably aren't even aware of no
*  They're not and I did a whole video about it. Yeah, cuz I remember I remember black lives matter
*  And it was a video I did I think two years ago
*  But I remember like and this one I was with the NRA and black lives matter was attacking then all right basically saying
*  That they don't really care about black gun ownership so forth and so on
*  It was like an attack piece and I think it was the branch of black lives matter
*  That's here in LA actually and so I did a response video and I and I and I it was like a
*  15 20 minute video and I broke it down systematically. I'm like, alright, well, okay
*  We started off the black lives matter because of police brutality cool. I'm all for it
*  but what has happened now all of a sudden they get this massive wave of funding and
*  Their whole direction shifts into some other stuff that I have no idea what it has to do with anything
*  With respect to now it's become this kind of like all-encompassing umbrella of
*  LGBTQ and some other stuff but then and then even aspects of I guess I don't want to say and Tifa is under the umbrella
*  but the whole Marxist kind of communist socialist aspects of
*  politics kind of creeping into that as well and
*  then when you couple that with the idea that you have the actual founders saying that they are trained in Marxism and
*  Then you have what you see now playing out where you have these
*  Very peaceful protests being co-opted by violent people who are now just engaging in rioting and looting and then branding it black lives matter
*  Mmm, they're wolves hanging their wolves hiding amongst sheep
*  I think there's there's a bunch of things happening at the same time
*  And I think when it comes to the rioting and looting, I think there's a lot of just opportunists
*  No, I don't think they're necessarily that organized some of it is organized
*  I do believe that and then I do and you're right because there was in like for instance in Dallas in Dallas
*  One of the copy shops that I go to all the time
*  he was telling me he was like
*  you know all the windows were broken out and
*  Really? He was like they really was just a bunch of kids just running around taking advantage of the chaos and just kind of breaking
*  Windows you have to take into consideration these kids haven't worked in three months. Yeah, they're probably broke as fuck and looking for free shit
*  Yep, there's a ton of them and there's just opportunists and you saw that in New York for sure. Yeah
*  I'm pretty sure you had that here too. Yeah for sure for sure
*  But the crazy thing about New York is a lot of it was apartment buildings filming down on the streets because you know in New York
*  Everyone's in yeah. Yeah, so they're filming
*  There's so many videos of people filming on the streets where all this madness is going this one crazy video where all these people are
*  Breaking into shit and this guy runs the street another guy hits him with a car and he goes flying through the air and the car takes
*  Off bro. It's mad and and then they just smash him through Soho and breaking into art galleries and stealing everything and like it's it's nuts
*  But it also but it bodes a question when you have
*  chaos
*  You inevitably will get destruction. Yes, that's I mean that's that's what happens. Yeah, which is why you need structure
*  This is why you need keep in mind. I am no fan of big government. I'll be the first one to tell you
*  I am no fan of big government. However
*  You do need a level of law and order. Here's where I'm a fan of big government and I wish it did a better job
*  When
*  The kovid shit went down and no one could work now
*  It turned out that kovid was not nearly as deadly as we were worried it was but it could have been and no one could
*  Work and that's why everybody stayed locked up when that happened. That's when we needed money. That's when we needed stimulus checks
*  That's when we needed people to get that 1200 bucks that they only handed out once like how fucking crazy is that?
*  They handed out trillions of dollars to all these corporations and they handed 1200 bucks out once to it
*  I mean, I don't know how many people got it
*  I don't know either but that's not enough for humans to live off what you're right three fucking months
*  If there was a time to ever do that, it was then it was then that was the time where big government made sense
*  Yeah, and it didn't work out
*  No, it didn't and there was all these empty promises and it's like they got away with giving out one check and then they stopped
*  And but it was supposed to be a constant thing, right? It was supposed to be from what I from my understanding
*  I mean I didn't get anything clearly but I for my understanding it was supposed to be a constant
*  Yeah a constant thing and that they didn't happen the way it happened, but it should demonstrate to a lot of people
*  To then you're gonna take the same government and put your safety completely in the hands of this same government, right?
*  I just doesn't make sense to me to me
*  The government is supposed to be value-added to what I'm already capable of doing myself. Mm-hmm
*  That's good
*  And so but I think too many people depend on the government entirely and I don't think that's smart
*  Right, I just don't and I'm not saying that life is fair. I'm not saying that the system we have in place is fair
*  It's not it's not it's not fair. It's just but what are you gonna do?
*  Right. What are you gonna do? I I the way I was raised in the way that my mom raised me was
*  Literally life is not fair son
*  Deal with it figure it out find a way around it
*  Right, that's that that's the way I go about life a lot of people don't like that. Some people think it's too optimistic
*  It's not optimistic because I'd realistic. Unfortunately, whether it's optimistic or pessimistic. It's realistic
*  What you get a hand of cards? Yeah, and if you're you're dealt a shit hand of cards and you just sit around complaining about it
*  It doesn't do you any good
*  There's people that have been dealt shitty your hands and they've figured it out
*  You know, it sucks. It sucks to be dealt a shitty hand of cards and I understand envy
*  I understand when you're looking at people that have dealt an amazing hand of cards. Yeah
*  No, the funny thing about it is I um, you know, I think I tweeted out some time ago
*  I listened to a lot of I listened to a lot of rap like a lot of trap music and
*  I'm not I'm not from the streets. Yeah, sure
*  There was a period of my life where I were where I live was basically the slums, but I'm not a street, dude
*  Never sold drugs. None of that. However, there's a there's a certain
*  Aspect of that music and understanding that there are a lot of people who have come from worse places than me
*  Who have been who have managed to kind of bring themselves out of it that when I look at my life
*  I say well, I have no excuse. I
*  Have no excuse whatsoever. So I need to figure out a way to make my situation better. However now there's no guarantee
*  I'll be able to do it. I make I may work my ass off and still fail
*  But I'm gonna keep working my ass
*  The game of life the
*  Unfortunate thing is that some people are not gifted with a parent that gives them the sort of perspective that your mom gave you
*  The life is not fail fair deal with it
*  And then you go forth with that knowledge just a lot of people out there that unfortunately
*  They're born into terrible households where they're abused and there's crime around them and violence and they never get a chance
*  They never get a chance and I get it because they've developed
*  Developed any abusive
*  mentalities these
*  mentalities that develop in this in that's a thing up situation and that's the thing to that thing that's a problem with the conversation that's
*  Going on too many people are too dismissive of that reality
*  Right, right because even though I can sit here and tell I can tell you yeah
*  Basically what I'm saying is pull yourselves up by your bootstraps. That's essentially what I'm saying
*  Well, at least that's the way I look at life
*  I'm like figure out a way if I don't have boots figure out we get the boots so I can pull my ass up
*  but
*  To completely ignore the circumstance like you talked about you have to talk about a kid
*  Who's a child of somebody who grew up in the 80s crack epidemic? Yeah, right to parents who were crackheads
*  you can't look at this person and like
*  You know like a little baby little baby just came out with a song right called bigger picture and then he was like
*  I'm just a product of my environment
*  Nobody nobody taught us any better
*  So as a result of that I look at that and I understand what the 80s crack epidemic did to black families during that time period
*  So now you have crack heads
*  Raising crack heads and then having kids
*  That's essentially what's what happened as a result of that so to ignore that and to say nah
*  Nah, nah, nah, you know everybody has it hard which they do
*  But you can't discount it and say that it doesn't have an effect
*  Because there is there is an there is an aspect of being so low you really don't stand a chance in hell, right?
*  Right and to dismiss that wholesale. I think it's disingenuous now. What do we do about it?
*  Now what do we do about it? I don't I'm not smart enough to have the answer for that
*  But there but there needs to be something a
*  Bare minimum at least have the conversation
*  Yeah, I think the conversation should be how come you guys had trillions of dollars to bail out these corporations during the kovat lockdown
*  But you didn't have trillions of dollars to fix these impoverished communities that have been in the same situation for decades
*  Freaking decades
*  It's nuts man, that's what it is
*  It's like there's so much money that you can spend to avoid an economic collapse
*  But yet there's no money to fix what's been an economic collapse forever. What are you doing with my money?
*  I paid 30% tax. What the fuck are you doing with my money there? Yeah, exactly
*  Exactly, you know and I've said it again. I've said it before I'll say it again
*  If you want to make America great, you would want less losers
*  Yeah, how do you have less losers give people more of an opportunity to get better?
*  Give people more of an opportunity to succeed and that's they should look at all those spots whether it's Baltimore or Detroit
*  or South Side of Chicago look at all those spots in this country as
*  Places where people have much less of a chance. So if you give them more of a chance
*  You can have more productive people you can have a stronger country. Yeah, it's really simple. It's simple
*  It's and the funny thing is it's you'll probably see the most growth happen in those places. It's just like lifting weights
*  I haven't lifted in 20 years, you know, you start with weights on a regular basis. You're like yo
*  I'm seeing transformations. It's only been doing it for a while. You're like, oh man, I'm stagnating
*  Good point. Yeah, that's a good point, you know, and it would it's also we're supposed to be a community
*  Yeah, you know, I mean that's one thing that I do love about these peaceful protests all these people marching together whether or not
*  They're all gonna get kovat or not
*  Especially at night apparently
*  Brett Weinstein sent me something Jamie. I'll send it to you
*  It's very interesting. But one of the things they found out about coded is that it dies almost
*  Instantly airborne kovat when it hits UV light really? Yeah, I'm gonna send you this Jamie
*  Which is really kind of crazy. Yeah, so it's one of the reasons why
*  Apparently that it wasn't like
*  I'm sorry
*  Yeah, I'll do this and then I'll do this yeah that'll this will work
*  Here we go
*  It's rapidly
*  Inactivated by simulated sunlight or sunlight. Yeah, just UV light kills it
*  Yeah, you can see we run around my house is gonna look like a ray, but but what's interesting is what Brett Weinstein's
*  what his
*  Theory was or his thought was it's this
*  He's a biologist and he was on the podcast last week
*  One of the things that he pointed out was there's all these indications that this is something that escaped from a lab
*  Yeah, like very specific indications. Yeah, and these indications are basically the way it evolved that evolved far too quickly
*  And then he pointed out some things that I'm not gonna remember because I'm a moron
*  But he said also it seems like because of the fact that it dies in sunlight
*  But it spreads very easily
*  With without sunlight good. It's very contagious. He thinks it may have evolved in this laboratory environment to be more contagious while indoors
*  So his thought is that this is something that they probably
*  Had created in order to test
*  various antiviral
*  Medications and all these different things and that during this process somehow or another got out and it's one of the reasons why this thing
*  Spread so quickly to people indoors. Gotcha. Yeah, but it's so fucking it's so crazy. So contentious
*  That's another thing people got mad at me because I was saying that you didn't have to wear a mask
*  Well, that's what I read
*  The CDC was saying that unless you're dealing with kovat patients or was it the World Health Organization?
*  But then again also I was saying it to fuck with my friend bill burr
*  I think you should know this folks when I was saying that I was trolling bill burr to try to get him to go on a rant
*  But maybe was the Kyle Dunnigan show too
*  Listen, don't listen to me. I'm a moron go online, but don't get mad at me either. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about
*  But I do know that there's these giant spikes in all these cities where they had big protests
*  Yeah, I mean that mean that's yeah, it's gonna happen
*  I mean, yeah
*  I mean you got you have a highly dense populated area with a bunch of people marching sweating and though
*  It's hilarious is they're blaming it on Republican governors opening up the states too early
*  That's they keep blaming this party politics stuff is so it drives me insane but it's happening in California too
*  This is a super liberal progressive state. It's happening right here, too
*  We're gonna drive ourselves crazy with this. We are this political. They should make they should make political parties illegal
*  They're really shy. I'm not you can't you can't say you're a Republican or a governor or a
*  Democrat it's just too confusing to people. I just want you to tell me what you want to do
*  Yeah, tell me what you're what do you want to do? Yeah, what do you want to do and then we can talk and then?
*  Let's let's have that conversation stop hide behind a donkey or an elephant you confuse the fuck out of me
*  You know, I'm I'm of the same nature. Yeah, like what do we do?
*  And man, we keep playing this game what it does is it creates extremes. Yep, right and so without extremes again, no nuance
*  Yeah, without nuance really don't solve anything. Everything just becomes everything becomes a nail and everyone's in hammer. Yeah, that's pretty much what happens
*  Exactly. And so we need we need more scalpels. That's what we need. We need more options
*  You know this two-party option that's left us with Joe Biden or Donald Trump is so bonkers
*  That's another thing people got mad at me last week
*  Cuz I said that Joe Biden is experiencing cognitive decline and people are how was it? How is anybody not seeing that? Thank you
*  How was that? No, that's that's really that I think I think it's just people that think that I'm gonna fuck up the Democrats
*  Options that there's some other people gonna listen to me and come on like it's it's so it's not even like look
*  I'm debatable. It's not it's not it's not man
*  It's not if Trump was that confused all the time
*  They would be hammering that hammering hard and by the way, he has been confused before don't get it wrong. I mean, but they're both old
*  What's that?
*  Trump's medicated. I think when I've seen these videos where he's like
*  Slurred David Pakman had a bunch that he put up where he's like slurring his words
*  I think he's like coming down off some shit or you know what I mean? Like I think he's on some uppers
*  I think he's on some I think that's how he's so peppy
*  Well, if that does those rallies that's the case get that same shit to Joe Biden
*  Because like to this cuz it's ridiculous man, it's beyond politics. Yes beyond politics just his cognitive ability
*  I can't vote for him alone on that right now granted his politics completely. He's not just he's gonna stand a chance in hell with me
*  But cognitively no, it's not that's not it man. Who are you gonna vote for? Do you know?
*  Right now. I'll probably do same thing. I did last time
*  but
*  Yeah, yeah, that's where I'm at. What does that mean? I voted for Trump last time did you?
*  How dare you? I know right people get mad at you. Oh all the time really? Yeah, but I'm a pragmatic vote
*  Did they get mad at you for that more or the black lives matter
*  Position you were just describing um
*  Well the black lives matter will find out the black lives matter position. I described
*  I hadn't talked about that in almost two years, but you talked about it on
*  Before yeah, and I got a lot
*  I got some people understood where I was coming from something people have to understand like I
*  Really really really try to remove all sense of emotion when I try to assess or analyze the situation
*  I look at I look at things as pragmatic as I possibly can not discounting my emotions
*  I just try to remove it when I'm analyzing it and then make my decision
*  I'm still human right right so I'm gonna have my biases
*  But I am very practical and I also understand I have a platform that is rather large
*  Yeah, so it's it's irresponsible for me to just go off on emotional tirades based on how I feel without
*  Investigating facts now have I been wrong?
*  Have I maybe shot my mouth off a little bit before hand before I should have yeah
*  But I try to learn from those mistakes right and so with and then another thing too because there is no nuance
*  Most of the people who are mad at me
*  About especially with the black lives matter aspect of things like I don't have a problem with the black lives matter sentiment
*  I'm freaking black right
*  Understand that yeah, however, I just I'm not a fan of the organization you're not a fan of Marxism
*  I'm not yeah, yes, actually, you know what? That's that's a beautiful way of putting it
*  Yeah, remove that Marxist element of it when we talk that's what's interesting
*  It's like every movement gets kind of co-opted by some of the ideas that are attached to the movement
*  It's like sometimes they have a really good bill, right?
*  And they're trying to pass like a stimulus bill and then you look in the bill and there's all sorts of shit
*  I mean, that's almost trying to shove into things kind of deliberate something, you know, they'll pollute it
*  So it doesn't get passed. That's it. That's a big part of politics
*  But you don't expect that from something that seems so
*  Organic like black lives matter like Michael Che has a great bit about it
*  But he's like think about I'm gonna fuck up the bit but is it like basically just the sentiment is so like all we're saying
*  Is they matter? Yeah, like that's even people argue that yeah
*  That's that's where I look at the disingenuous nature of the conversations that are being had like it's as simple as this
*  Like I don't see why anybody would get mad at black lives matter and I don't understand why anybody would get mad at all
*  Lives matter but I can see why somebody would get mad at someone saying all eyes matter and responsible black lives matter because what it seems
*  Like it's doing is just
*  Undermining and just kind of tossing aside the aspect of the complaint right the complaint is
*  Cops have been killing black people and it's on video and we all should be outraged. We should yes
*  Yes
*  and if it is the
*  People because people do make the argument that well there all eyes matter and more white people are killed by cops and and you're right
*  And and I think you should be as equally mad
*  I do if you if you have police brutality should should not stop at a race, right police brutality police brutality
*  So my but my thing is this if we live in a country and we're supposed to be all one all lives do matter
*  We do however if there is a particularized group of people within that within that that inclusiveness that feel like their lives don't matter
*  At bare minimum we should have that conversation, right? We should just at least have that conversation say
*  Why do you feel that way?
*  Why why what is it exactly that makes you think that your life doesn't matter?
*  And then when we go through the particular points and address each one, you know what it may be coming from nowhere
*  It may be delusion or it may be completely utterly valid
*  But at bare minimum if we can't even get to the point where you have the conversation because our instinctive gut is to say no
*  All eyes matter. What are you talking about? Right? It's not it's not fair
*  It's not fair. I'm not saying one one side is right at the other
*  What I'm saying is we're gonna be a country that's all one people and there's a part of it that's telling you
*  We don't feel like we matter, right?
*  We need to address it. Yes and understand why the fuck they feel that way
*  If the Indian people were saying the same thing Indian lives don't matter. I don't really I'm not Indian
*  I didn't grow up in the culture. I don't know what particularized issues you may have growing up in this society
*  I don't know what the hell you're talking about. But
*  Talk to me, let me hear you out right because clearly you feel some type of way
*  So let me hear what you have to say about that and then we can have that conversation and say alright
*  Maybe we'll reach a point where they go
*  You know what? Maybe I was taking this a little too far or maybe I go damn I didn't realize that I've been so consumed with
*  My life that I didn't realize that you had to go through these difficulties as well that I didn't have to right
*  You know, but we can't even get to that point because we're so polarized
*  So polarized I think I think we're doing better at it than we ever had before though
*  just because of the fact there's been these gigantic peaceful protests and the conversation is going and also because
*  Look, I don't think it's good that people get fired for saying all lives matter, but they do get fired for saying all lives matter
*  I think people should be allowed to say whatever they want without fear retribution
*  Well, I do too
*  but it's it's fascinating to me that there's these feel fearful people that want to cancel people for every every mistake and
*  Everything they've done wrong one thing that I I had a conversation with somebody about it when they were saying like what's wrong with saying?
*  All lives matter. I'm like, there's nothing wrong with saying all lives matter
*  But here's the problem
*  The only reason why people are saying black lives matter is because there's people out there that don't feel like they matter
*  Yeah, if you said white lives matter people would be like duh
*  Yeah, you couldn't have a movement in this country that says white lives matter people be like what the fuck are you complaining about?
*  But see but here's the thing about that too though
*  Everybody has the ever in a country is as mixed as we are
*  Everyone has the particularized issues in this country. Everybody has their own problems as a group
*  I'm not gonna discount your problems because I don't suffer from them. So if you want to tell me all white all white lives matter cool
*  I'm not white. I don't know what the hell you're going through. I mean I'll hear you out
*  What's the issue because I'm still in I'm living in this country with you. I consider you my brother
*  So we may have a different upbringing a different cultural background
*  But tell me what what is the issue that you're dealing with and why do you feel that way?
*  Because right now from my standpoint, I mean I may as a black person I may look at you and say well
*  What the hell are you complaining? It's so ridiculous
*  All lives matter at least makes some sense that we should all be together
*  Like if you're talking police about police brutality in particular, yeah bad cops kill all kinds of people
*  There's plenty of videos of cops killing white people. There's there's a horrible video of those cops pushing that old man down
*  Walk that's so messed up that old man has a broken skull and he can't fucking walk and he's got permanent brain damage
*  He's old as fuck and then Trump goes and says some crazy shit like he might have been Antifa and he might have been like
*  He's old as fuck. That's so crazy. That's the crazy like to look at that video and not say hey
*  You shouldn't push an old man. Yeah that yeah, I thought that was an easy sell
*  I don't know what the guy was saying to the cops, but there's no read. I mean, I mean it's old guy
*  Like I mean it felt it felt too easy. I'm like bitch. You can't even walk down a ramp. I think what happened
*  Right
*  He spent ten minutes in his fucking speech the other day talking about why he couldn't why it was so hard to walk down the
*  Ramp my shoes were slippery. I get it man
*  But you can't even walk down a ramp if you have those slippery shoes on you're telling me you wouldn't fall down like that old man
*  I bet you would I bet you fucking would but I think sometimes what happened
*  It's weird because I think the problem is sometimes is and I suffer from it too man
*  We get so much information so fast right and it's hard to keep up with it. I saw Hartford me
*  People ask me why don't you talk about this? I'm talking about that. It's like it's not a good issue
*  Well, why don't you I can barely keep up with the gun issue, right much less anything else?
*  I think he suffers from that sometimes too. Well here see something he suffers from the same kind of
*  Headline focus he'll see it and won't really investigate it any further
*  And then he'll just and then he'll kind of take whatever confirmation bias
*  He may have over here and over here and just kind of throw it together and then he'll say something
*  I think you're a hundred percent right. I think he has too many things going on
*  Yeah, I think first of all, I don't think anybody should be president
*  I think it's a ridiculous position. Yeah, and I think it should be like a council of wise folks. That's what it should be
*  That becomes an oligarchy maybe a good point. Well, what the fuck man being a president?
*  It's not that's not good either. I mean, but even then within that
*  I mean some people would argue president nothing more than a ceremonial position, right?
*  But we pin all these problems on them. It's like we pin kovat on them
*  Yeah, we pin North Korea on it. We pin China trade relations
*  We've been war with Iran war with Syria war with this that there's so many different things the environment
*  Oh, what are you doing these fucking? Yeah
*  Fracking I respect anybody who's a president
*  I may not agree with you
*  But to be in that position and do what you have to do with I have no choice but to respect it
*  Which is why I will always respect the office and who's in it. Well, I hope they do well, that's what I do
*  Yeah
*  I want them to do well the idea that there's some people that wanted Trump to fail and they wanted economy to collapse
*  So he would get removed from office now, they just want to prove themselves
*  There's a little bit of that too, but this also like come on man. That is bad for everybody
*  what you what you really should be is like
*  What everybody should be hopeful or should have been hopeful for when he got erected is to be pleasantly surprised
*  Yeah, pleasantly surprised that he said like I'm sorry all the shit I said about Mexicans being rapists
*  But now I'm not gonna do that anymore. I'm gonna do my best to make this
*  Even that even that was taken out of context
*  Yes, and so it's like it's in it's it sucks because here's nothing because people always like to say that man people are dumb
*  And and and I'm like, I don't want to think that more more
*  I think that but what I think a lot of it is is man, we have so much information now and
*  So many people are angling for their own agenda based on the on the same information, right?
*  You don't know what's what and so we were getting these bits of it
*  If I'm worried about raising my kids working providing for my family, it's hard
*  It's gonna be hard for me to intellectualize. I mean we do this for a living, right?
*  So it's gonna be hard for somebody who's just trying to raise a family
*  It's not like you don't have a family to raise either but
*  It's hard to be able to parse through all the information we have at our disposal to come out with what's actually true and correct or
*  Full context right and have a good take on yeah, you know, I mean that's the other thing
*  It's so difficult for someone like me who does talk for a living and I fuck things up all the time
*  You know and I can't imagine
*  Being in charge of as many things as anybody that is a president or a governor or even a mayor is in charge
*  It must be fucking insane. Yeah, no, it's nutty man
*  I I know what I have to deal with
*  Yeah in terms of just my little platform over here in this little small area and it's a lot man
*  Because especially if you actually give a damn yes
*  If I'm if I was just out here acting and just saying shit because you know, just feeding my base
*  Whatever they want to hear right then that'd be a different story
*  But I challenge I challenge my base all the time
*  Well, I think that's one of the reasons why you resonate because you are a genuine person like you're it's very obvious that the things
*  You say you say them because you mean it and this is your perspective and this is your well-thought-out
*  perspective on things and I think that that's
*  That there's a big difference between that and someone who just says shit because they think that this is their their brand
*  Yeah, and this is their audience is going to respond to this and this is probably gonna get me more likes
*  Yeah, and that that's a real problem with social media
*  The thing is it's it's frustrating like I did a I did a piece on a mod Aubrey a mod Aubrey case
*  the shooting in Georgia I
*  Didn't see with the the I know the
*  So I basically I did I did a complete legal analysis of it
*  Which essentially what I did in that 20-minute video lawyers get paid five hundred to a thousand dollars an hour for
*  Because so much time it took me two days to put that video together
*  Because I needed to make sure all my facts and elements were correct. I basically had to go back to being a law school all over
*  again and
*  While that's happening there are tons of other things happening too that I need to comment on as well
*  But I'm just I'd rather err on the side of falling behind on being the first on the news
*  To make sure or try to get it as right as possible
*  And that requires a lot of fucking time man
*  And then on top of that I still got to review guns and do all the other stuff
*  So it frustrates me, but like my mom said you made your bed and I laying it
*  Right my complaining about it
*  But I just need some people to understand the perspective and where I'm coming from and why I'm not quick to talk about a
*  Lot of stuff because sometimes I just need time to figure out what the hell is going on
*  Because there are a lot of people I get messages who rely on my information to make their decision
*  They don't just follow what I say they just use my information to make their decision
*  So I want to give them the best piece of information like putting gas in your car
*  I don't put shitty gas in the car right I want the car to run functionally
*  So I'm gonna try to give it the best gas as possible
*  And so that's what I try to do especially when I talk about the gun issue, you know because right now
*  There's so much misinformation on the gun issue and a lot of times people don't even know what they don't know
*  Like for instance with like you mean you had Alonzo Baden on here like I could tell
*  Laboury seems coming from a good place
*  He just there's some things he just didn't know he knew or didn't know right and so that's how that's kind of where I put
*  Myself I said, okay
*  How do I tailor and craft videos in such a way that somebody who isn't necessarily a gun person can understand it?
*  What what Alonzo Bowden said what what bothered you a part of it?
*  So some of the misinformation with respect to like the background checks
*  the background check aspect of it where he kind of talked about it from the standpoint of the the waiting period the
*  Questionnaire that you filled out in the beginning before you submit yourself for the background check that that that was the background check and it wasn't
*  And so because a lot of people think that a lot of people think that oh you just go there fill out a yes or no question
*  Yes or no questionnaire about whether or not you can own a gun and then you get a gun and that's not the case
*  And so I corrected that and then also what I did
*  I just critiqued his position on a couple of things like for instance high capacity magazines
*  Because he says he's like you don't need 50 rounds in a clip so to speak. Hmm
*  Well, it's actually a magazine, but that's neither here nor there, but I I disagree with that now in that regard
*  He's not wrong. That's his opinion
*  My opinion is I think I do need a magazine that has 50 rounds and then I went on to explain why
*  Would you say you want to kill 50 people? No, man
*  So so so with respect so why do we own firearms we own firearms a lot of people own our only firearms for self-defense
*  Right and as a regular person, I'm not a criminal. I just go about my day. I don't want to be I'm already
*  I'm already coming on the back end
*  I'm already at a disadvantage because a criminal who's going out to commit a crime knows
*  He's going to commit a crime and what can you do when you know, you're about to do something you prepare and
*  Since he's a criminal he doesn't have to deal with all of the restraints that come with what laws
*  So if there's a law that says you can't have more than ten rounds in like here in California, right?
*  I can't have a magazine that has more than ten rounds
*  If I'm a criminal and I know I'm gonna commit a crime
*  Do I really give a damn about a law says I can't come I can't carry ten rounds in my magazine, right?
*  I don't however as a as a citizen when I'm going about my life carrying a gun on me is hard enough
*  Right and because like, you know, there's hope this whole dialogues about what size gun you can have
*  How many rounds you want to have what bullet caliber things of that nature? I don't know what I'm gonna face
*  I could face one guy. I can face one guy who's high as hell
*  I can face two three four five guys. I don't know
*  So why artificially limit the number of bullets I can have in my gun when I don't know what I might be facing
*  To protect my life from what's a weird thing too. It's cuz like I don't know if you're preserving any life
*  By limiting the size of a magazine. You're not I don't understand it
*  Well, I think it's hard to me cut you off. No, go ahead
*  What the argument is is if they're looking at it from a mass shooter perspective, right?
*  They're saying if you limit the amount of bullets that the mass you can have that means more change clips
*  Yeah, but again, he's going out to commit mass murder
*  Do you think he cares about breaking the law that says he can only have ten rounds in his magazine?
*  I think their idea is that it makes it harder for him to get those clips because he can't get them at the local gun store
*  There are more of those out there than guns and we have over 300 million guns in this country, right?
*  They're gonna have them but you know with a lot of these mass shooters. Here's the other problem
*  They're actually getting the guns illegally they're getting them from someone you know
*  They're stealing them from someone's gun safe or from someone's house. Yeah, that's what a lot of it is coming from anyway
*  I think what a lot I think a lot of the the kind of project not so much the politicians
*  I think the politicians are by and large very disingenuous
*  But a lot of people who support these ideas who are just regular people
*  I think they're it's their way of trying to figure out some way to of control
*  Because because mass shootings terrifies because they're so random like they're like tornadoes see hurricanes
*  You can kind of prepare for a hurricane you kind of have an idea of where the path is coming where it's going
*  Tornadoes they just touch down and destroy shit, right and you don't know when it's coming
*  same thing with mass shootings mass shootings are
*  Terrifying because they just kind of happen out of nowhere. It's like whoa. What okay?
*  What can we do because you feel helpless you really feel helpless and even though they account for almost a
*  Statistical zero of gun of gun violence in this country
*  They still terrifies because we don't know when or where it's gonna happen
*  See the other gun violence stuff doesn't really terrifies as much because we know where it happens right happens in the inner cities
*  Don't go to any cities, right?
*  But mass shootings terrifies from that stance because we don't know when it's gonna come so we think okay
*  Well, if we we limit this and we restrict this then then it'll minimize it even more and it's like no
*  It's not gonna happen. We have to deal with the reality and the reality terrifies me just as much as anyone else
*  But what are you gonna do? You're gonna lay down and die?
*  No, you fight yeah, and that and that's it and then I remember when I was on Bill Maher
*  And we talked about arming teachers right the idea of arming teachers
*  And he was like I was like well if a teacher is willing to sacrifice teachers that have sacrificed their lives
*  For their students during that shoot during school shootings
*  So I'm like if teachers willing to sacrifice their life for their kids
*  Why not put a gun in your hand to give them the power to fight for their life?
*  And he goes because they're teachers. He's like they're there to teach and I'm like
*  Well, they're already dying for the students. Well the idea that it's mutually exclusive seems kind of silly. Yeah
*  There's a lot of really intelligent people that can teach and also know how to shoot a gun exactly
*  That's not and and I think the misconception too was I was like a lot of people thought I was saying we need to mandate
*  That teachers own firearms. That's not what I was saying
*  What I'm saying was if some if there's a teacher who wants to go through the process of being able to carry a firearm in school
*  Why not let them do that right? That's all I'm saying when he said because they're teachers that everybody oh my god. Yes, it was thunderous
*  That's a problem with doing a show in front of an audience yeah, yeah, no you do shit for class because they're teachers
*  Now in all fairness during the conversation he poked any product and I think he gave me more of a fair shot than anybody else
*  Yeah, he's an intelligent guy. Yeah, he is now when I went to the when I
*  Went to the roundtable discussion that was a different story and part of it was I thought I could approach it
*  Rationally yeah, and I couldn't because all the person that I was dealing with was doing was appealing to emotion mm-hmm
*  And so what were they saying basically there was like I would talk about the idea of background checks for instance
*  And I was like well. How are you gonna enforce them and they're like
*  and she would just kind of stutter and stammer, but then if the
*  Bill Maher posted a picture of a guy who had like a bunch in California had a bunch of guns that were seized
*  And she's like oh my god all those guns who needs all those guns
*  I'm like I'm like look I get it like you see and you attribute a very nefarious nature to firearms in general
*  I don't I have a lot of guns
*  I don't go around killing people and I only have two hands that guy only has two hands so number of guns
*  He has is irrelevant
*  Then she's like but they can use those guns give the other people to kill as many people like it's just just
*  Hysteria and I'm just like oh god
*  That's not how this works. Well. It's also a long
*  Conversation and this is my problem with any of those shows is that you got like three minutes to discuss something that should be three hours
*  Yeah, and at the end of three hours you probably still yeah
*  You still got a walk away with a lot of questions and maybe not even really coming up with any solution and
*  Most likely yeah most likely not coming up with any solution
*  It seems like this it's a very particularly human problem, you know the problem of gun ownership in this country
*  You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't you know, it's
*  And I think again one of the reasons why I want to bring you on right after this
*  COVID thing when I contacted you because I think that people are now
*  understanding that hey this
*  Police thing that you were counting on to protect you
*  Well, you've just a lot of people that are trying to defund them now
*  Yeah, you're not gonna get them in certain places because they're in conflict with
*  the state and the the government like in Atlanta or
*  In New York where they're quitting left and right and in California
*  They're trying to get the sheriff of Santa Monica stamp to step down. I mean you got a lot of problems with the police
*  Yeah, it's not as simple as call the police. They'll be there for you
*  Even when it was that simple. Yeah, even when it was in effect. It's an illusion
*  Right and this is what you and I and I know we talked about this before that this this
*  Idea that you shouldn't be self-reliant. You should be dependent upon the government
*  This is what the Second Amendment was written for people say it was designed like a well-armed militia
*  It was designed in case, you know, someone was coming and attacking you like no it could be the government themselves
*  The government is filled with people
*  They're humans and when is that when have you ever seen a time where the government has said no we want less power
*  Never and once they get power they never give it back back
*  And that's what I keep trying to tell people like look I get you want to try things
*  They just want to throw things on the wall. Hope it sticks. Yeah, let's let's ban these guns. Let's limit this capacity
*  Let's do this like you do that. You don't get it back. So even if it's a whip it doesn't work
*  You think the government's gonna say well better yet this this whole idea that they're going to have a gun buyback program, right?
*  Voluntary buyback you think they're gonna give you your guns back if it doesn't work if the crime rate still stays the same
*  Which it has in other places that have done the same thing, but Australia
*  What they don't talk about about Australia is when they did it it actually crime spiked did it
*  Yeah
*  Because you got to think about it like the whole notion or idea that like criminals are criminals of opportunity, right?
*  Right. So no one has a gun. No one has a gun
*  Think about it's just like what's going on in in Chas now or what's going on in Atlanta
*  If there are no cops around criminals are going to show up and they want to take advantage of the chaos
*  Yes, period and you're not gonna tell me that no the cops will always be there. Look what happened in Canada
*  The guy stole a gun from a cop killed the cop and went on a rampage killing spree
*  For almost 12 13 hours. He shut down an entire city by himself
*  That one is a weird one and I was reading something about it last night
*  See if you can find this that he withdrew a huge amount of money like more than 400
*  Shit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He withdrew more than
*  $400,000 from a bank account. How does he even how was he even able to do that?
*  Exactly, and there's some concern that this might have been some sort of intelligence operation
*  That there's something more to this story
*  Because they were talking about the way he got that money that it very well could have been that he was involved in something
*  on a totally different level Nova Scotia's shooter case has hallmarks of an undercover operation
*  police say the killer's withdrawal
*  $475,000 was highly irregular and how the RC MP agent would get money how and RC MP
*  I don't know what that world Canadian mounted police. I think that is
*  Withdrawal
*  $475,000 in cash by the man who killed 22 Nova Scotians in April matches the method that is Royal Canadian Mountain
*  Police mounted police right uses to send money to confidential informants and agents
*  Sources say Gabrielle Wattman who is responsible for the largest mass killing in Canadian history withdrew the money from a Brinks deposit in Dartmouth
*  Nova Scotia
*  March 30th stashing a carry-all filled with hundred dollar bills in the trunk of his car
*  Wow, when my thing is is like this for an operation that complex you think they'd be that sloppy
*  Yeah, yeah, they're filled with people
*  And they're Canadians so they're actually nice
*  sources in both banking and the RC MP say the transaction is consistent with how the RC MP funnels money to its
*  confidential informants and agents and is not an option available to private banking customers
*  The RC MP has repeatedly said it has no in quotes special relationship with Wartman what means the regular relationship
*  Court documents show that Wartman owned a New Brunswick registered company called Berkshire
*  Broman the legal owner of two of his vehicles including one of the police replica cars. Oh, he was a crazy person
*  He had a police replica car a lot of them. Whatever the purpose of the company
*  There's no public evidence that could have been able to move large quantities of cash
*  Wartman also ran his own
*  What is a denturist business you make big teeth? Is that what is denturist? Yeah, basically a dentist. Oh, wow
*  Okay, so you had a fake teeth business
*  Yeah
*  And there's no reason to believe that it would also work that it would
*  It also would require him to handle large amounts of cash if Wartman is or was an RC MP
*  Informant or agent it would explain while the force appeared not to take action on complaints about his illegal
*  guns and his assault on his common-law wife
*  Whoa
*  So he might have been a fucking informant
*  So he might have been working for the government
*  That makes sense
*  Because there's a lot of say it doesn't make listen
*  There's a lot of sick fucks in all lines of business
*  Including dentists how many dentists have been accused of feeling up ladies after they put them under right? I'm yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, there's some sick fucks that are in all lines of work including informants plus informants like you're a fucking rat
*  So he's a he's a rat that went bad. Yeah
*  Could be so there's complex. There's a complex. Yeah, very much. So very much. So yeah. Yeah
*  Let's still happen
*  Yeah
*  But then again, it's funny because immediately after that. Yes, unilaterally Trudeau basically said no more guns
*  Yeah, at least no more no assault rifles, which are yeah, which drive gun people crazy. Yes because
*  What does that mean? All right, so
*  Assault rifle and assault rifle is a good to put it simply and I'm trying to explain some plain language people
*  Who don't know any different most people think when they see us here saw rifle
*  They think a machine gun which is fully automatic or semi-automatic. I'm not semantic fully automatic or
*  Burst basically it's like three rounds at a time each time you pull the trigger
*  That's an assault rifle
*  Air 15s are not assault rifles right single shot. Yeah, the single shotgun you pull the trigger once you get one bullet
*  it's kind of synonymous, it's like comparing a
*  Rolls Royce to a Chrysler 300. Yeah, why do they call it an assault rifle then because it looks badass
*  Well, why does who call it an assault rifle? Why do people call an AR an assault rifle?
*  Well, because that's language used by the anti gunners who are pushing an agenda
*  So what they want to do is they want to closely tie the idea of a machine gun that people largely see being used in
*  movies to what's being sold on the street, so the distinction would be
*  Automatic versus semi-automatic. Yes, and the difference between an AR is you don't have to cock it like a bolt-action rifle every time
*  You fire a shot. Yes. Yeah, and that's one like one of the arguments in the hunting world
*  Is that you don't need an AR and it's not it wouldn't be effective and I've actually heard people say that I'm like no
*  No as a hunter it would be more effective because oftentimes you need a second shot
*  You need to get that shot if you can get out that second shot instantly bang bang
*  But it's ironically that's the same argument though used to why that we need to ban them
*  Because it allows a shooter to shoot and it allows a shooter to shoot faster than normal and then I argue that's why we need
*  Them for self-defense. Yeah again, it becomes one of those like really messy people problems. Yeah, like it's a mess
*  That's the common denominator behind all of it. Yeah, it's the people people but now they've even what they'll do
*  Is they'll try to invalidate that argument
*  It was like it's not good problem into people problem and they'll try to and they'll try to undermine it by acting like it's just a
*  Stupid trope. Yeah, but it's truth. Why I made a tweet a long time ago
*  I said this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem. Mm-hmm. I agree with you. It's really what it is
*  I absolutely agree with you. It's really what it is. It's and this is one thing that
*  Never gets discussed whenever one of these people does something really fucked up
*  They don't look at the amount of medication these people are on. You know, it's funny. They don't they don't they're almost all on medication
*  Almost all there's a common denominator guns and medication and one gets looked at very closely and the other gets
*  Blatantly ignored. Why do you think that is?
*  Because the pharmaceutical industry has a shitload of money and there's a lot of these politicians that are in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry
*  They they have a firm grip on the the narrative and so the gun is a perfect scapegoat
*  And they also don't want all the other people that are on these
*  Psychotropic medications to feel bad that they're on them that they could be lumped in with these same people that like imagine if we just started
*  Like if it's SSRIs or antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication imagine that becomes the narrative in the news
*  Yeah, like that people on SSRIs are fucking dangerous because all these school shooters are on SSRIs now see that
*  Because that would almost be a better argument
*  Than the NRA because if you look at the NRA and you look at NRA members and the amount of NRA members that have
*  actually
*  Done these horrible mass shootings. It's like none
*  Yeah
*  It's crazy that the medication is a better correlation than the NRA
*  Like saying that people's fucking
*  Heads explode yeah, well can you show you government show they have information on you? No, I'm just I'm just saying the facts
*  Responsible gun owners are not the people that are doing these things
*  It's crazy people and unfortunately crazy people are oftentimes on medication now
*  There's not that that's like a correlation causation argument as well
*  I'm not saying that the medication is forcing these people into doing that
*  But I am saying that I've known people that have taken SSRIs and have taken antidepressants and a lot of different psycho
*  Psychotropic medicines and one of the things that they've said is that it makes them not care about things
*  Yeah, it's real weird stuff can happen. It's like it's a it disassociates them from emotions
*  It's so and things don't bother them. I mean that that's scary
*  That's scary to me because I'm I am the total opposite. I feel everything
*  I mean, I really do I'm a very sensitive person
*  I know how to handle it
*  But I'm very sensitive and it could speak to the the notion that you when you hear people describe the account of
*  Interacting with a mass shooter. Yes, then having this kind of stoic
*  Yeah, they got shark eyes. Yeah. Yeah, they're all on medication man
*  I mean, it's it's really like the numbers are staggering and I'm not saying medication causes people to do that
*  Yeah, I mean it's something it's something that we need that needs to be talked about it does and explored
*  Nice it on the board of of walk to talk America, which is a
*  mental health fire a 2a mental health organization and whose goal basically is to
*  address the correlation if any or between
*  Firearm ownership and mental health and is this something that you got involved because of the attacks on gun ownership and the
*  Recognition that there is some sort of so the catalyst for it was to say because a lot of gun owners will say well
*  It's a mental health issue
*  And we'll always say that yeah, you and I agree we do believe that is the case
*  So what walk to talk America does is it says okay, so let's walk to talk
*  Let's try to figure out how to fix or deal with the mental health issue component
*  Right if we're gonna say that's what it is and it's not the gun and we do believe that so let's start
*  Having that conversation and doing what needs to do
*  so what the what the program the organization does is it it crosses the aisle with people in the mental health space and
*  Brings them over into the gun side and vice versa and so we can have those conversations to figure out a way how we can
*  Kind of balance the the firearm ownership with mental health
*  Because that conversation is not being had right and so I think if we're gonna talk about it and say it is mental health
*  Issue okay, so let's start this deep-sea dive into the mental health issue and see if we can come up with a solution
*  That that speaks to why we have so many people that have these mental health issues
*  And then how do we exist in a world where this many people have mental health issues in a world also?
*  Where we have this many guns yeah, and so so that we can better solve whatever problems
*  We think we have instead of just throwing around well. We need to ban this we need to come up with this
*  Stupid law like instead of doing that I couldn't agree more, and I don't think it's that simple
*  Yeah
*  I don't think it's as simple as banning things because I think there's a lot of people that are all responsible gun users
*  Gun users and gun owners, and I don't think you should do anything to take away their rights
*  Yeah, I really don't I did and I get in arguments with people about that particularly my liberal friends
*  You know they're like how can you call yourself a liberal when you have those that perspective? I'm like because it's rational
*  I don't understand why?
*  The gun debate is even politicized it should not be it shouldn't be political the fact that there's a division between
*  Like the fact that you can't be a liberal and and a pro-gun
*  It's crazy me the same way that like I can't be like the idea of being conservative and pro-gun is seen as a crazy thing
*  That doesn't make any sense to me either
*  I think the gun should live in a space that is it's it's outside of the idea of politics within reason of course
*  Because you know this always going to be everything politics is kind of everything right right but I don't think it should be that
*  Defensive divisively defined between being a liberal or conservative. Yeah, it's just so weird to me
*  Well, it's the vibe we're divisive about everything. It's true. There's there's certain topics like here's a good one
*  Global warming like I guarantee you man is global if you had across the board how much of?
*  Climate change is
*  Natural versus how much of it is man-made and you just just a simple question and you threw that out there
*  I guarantee if you looked at the numbers and you could get a real accurate assessment of how many conservatives and how many liberals
*  Responded and I think that if you said is it a hoax you and you went to the the yes side. Yes
*  It's a hoax. It's overwhelmingly conservative people think it's a hoax or that it's not not
*  I think the reason for that to a degree is because you have so many people you have you have very
*  very
*  Outfront figureheads who've tried to utilize global
*  Climate change as a way to kind of undermine the economic structure in this country in what way like you know
*  The green power and all this stuff like that like you look at the green deal to me. That's just
*  Economics version. It's just trying to entirely change the economic structure of our country
*  The new green deal for people don't know what it means like what they're trying to do
*  but as far as the really basically trying to try and replace all of our kind of
*  conservative means of production with respect to energy and
*  Replace it with green energy and and I don't think it's I don't think it's completely sustainable and it's not even like it's progressive
*  It's a complete turnaround 180 and I just think that's irresponsible now. Here's the thing about that
*  From my standpoint right I consider myself just right of center
*  As far as ideology I have not done enough research on climate change
*  To have a definitive opinion about it
*  so what I'm telling you is what I'm seeing other people say and
*  That's why I think there are a lot of people on the conservative aspect of it that are like it's a hoax
*  Because they see it as basic economic conversion
*  Now as far as climate change in and of itself. I don't know
*  I'm probably the last person to talk to about that because I like my cars to destroy the environment
*  Have you ever driven electric car? Yeah, you drove a Tesla? Yeah, what do you shake you like like you're not impressed? I
*  Don't want to be impressed. You don't want to be impressed. Oh, what do you mean? Because I'm like, I'm I want to hear the rumble
*  Yes, I'm since I love it now. Here's the thing
*  The Tesla truck is kind of calling me
*  It's calling me kind of yeah, I'm still I mean my favorite my favorite SUV or truck
*  I call it a truck is is a G wagon
*  So and then that is probably the biggest pollutant on the planet with respect to SUVs. They're pretty dope. I love them
*  Yeah, absolutely love them. They're so heavy, too. They are man. I love them. Yeah, they're dope the door you have to
*  Bank vault. Yeah, and see that's all I kind of like that old same thing with the defender. I get it
*  Defenders the opposite it's aluminum
*  Yeah, but there's so it's a suspension but they look dope yeah, they do is they look dope whereas the Mercedes the G wagon is actually dope
*  It's a different
*  Explain it's a different animal the Mercedes
*  Wagon yeah that motherfucker. First of all super modern like especially the new one
*  No independent front suspension. Yeah, it handles really well, by the way
*  These fucking suburban housewives are ever taking those goddamn things off-roading
*  So I don't even know why it ever had two live axles, right?
*  It's like most of what it is is like moms are picking up their kids in these fucking rich people
*  But here's the funny thing about that because I had I had a 63. I had a 2013 63 and all the time
*  Like people that's my dream car. That's my dream and then they ride in it. Oh, it's bumpy. It's terrible
*  But the new ones aren't yeah
*  New ones handle and they're so fast for what it is. Yeah, no, I get it dude. It's dope
*  But going back to the Tesla to me is the future when I drive one of those things and here's the thing too when COVID
*  The lockdown happened in Los Angeles. All of a sudden our air quality was fucking amazing. You could see the mountains
*  It was crazy. It was like oh my god. What are we doing ourselves? What are we doing to ourselves?
*  I if everybody had electric cars, that would be the case all day long every day
*  Some people make the argument that what you need like the batteries and so forth and so on cause as much of destruction
*  It's a good argument. So it's also conflict minerals now getting these from like these poor countries
*  Afghanistan and you know, yeah, I'm I don't know man
*  I'm I I have a hard time having this conversation because I'm so biased right and I'm being selfish
*  Listen my garage you see the shit I have
*  I've got a lot of muscle cars man. I love those. Yeah, but I also love my Tesla and I drive it all the time
*  I love it man. I love that. It's silent. I love that. It's stupid fast
*  I love that. It feels like it's from the future. It makes other cars feel dumb man. It does it's just so
*  Advanced yeah, no, you're right
*  You know funny thing is all the reasons why I love the new G wagon are the same reasons that you love the Tesla
*  Yeah, it's mine not withstanding the electric engine
*  So for me it's it's just me not wanting to I
*  romanticize the idea of car ownership so much and
*  Driving and the feel and all of that stuff you do lose that with some of the electric cars
*  So that's why I'm kind of hard-pressed to kind of completely jump on the electric card car bandwagon
*  Here's a crazy thing. Did we look this up?
*  I think we did because it was something that Jeremy Clarkson said on top gear that when the
*  Exhaust that comes out of a 911 turbo is actually cleaner than the air in a polluted area
*  Like if you think I remember him saying that you drive in downtown LA in a 911 turbo
*  You're actually exhaust is actually cleaner than the air that's getting sucked into the engine
*  So it is possible to make a low emissions combustion
*  The tycon from Porsche well, that's electric. Yeah, it is but I mean yeah there was it cuz in Dallas
*  They did a reveal and I was there and nothing's dope. Oh, man. I'm not gonna lie
*  I was like, okay
*  so now this is the this is where we get the marriage between the practical efficiency of electric cars and then the
*  That's in sorrow effect of having the old-world cars. That's now it's starting to get that marriage and that balance, right? Right
*  That I can make noise like like it accelerates like you can press a button and make a Jetsons noises
*  So like as you hit the gas
*  I
*  Rather you mimic the sound of like an old muscle car. Yeah, I can't get down with that
*  Yeah, I hate when like m3s were doing that
*  That's they did in my m6 and I walk off, you know what, you know, you're right
*  Yeah, it was kind of weird. Yeah. Well, that's the problem with turbos. They sound wack
*  Yeah, but you can get so much power out of yes, but the AMGs are also turbos
*  Like AMG G wagons are terrible. They sound fucking nasty
*  Yeah, they do figured out how to do it right with the exhaust that Porsche has not figured that out with their no
*  They haven't but man they figured out so many other things
*  Look if you drive one of their naturally aspirated engines, you the the noise is so glorious
*  Yeah, you don't ever want to go back to
*  The GT3 yes all the GT cars I guess they're all those are generally the
*  The GT3 RS and the GT3 yeah, they make yeah, they make beautiful they make a beautiful sound
*  Yeah, the GT2 RS sounds pretty fucking good too. Porsche states that under normal driving conditions
*  This car exceeds 31 miles per gallon and does indeed only produce a maximum carbon output of 300 units
*  So in retrospect Jeremy Clarkson's conclusion upon the heavily polluted cities is plausibly correct and therefore quite amazing
*  Yeah, because you know LA is dirty as fuck under normal conditions pretty amazing thank you
*  Jamie man was better than Jamie LA so heartbreaking. Yes. It's hard about now, and that's what I'm saying
*  Did you go down through Hollywood and see all the boarded windows and shit? I'm staying in Hollywood
*  Tell me what it's like for someone who hasn't been here since the
*  What's that thing remember the walking dead? Yeah, kind of close to that. Yeah, it's it's
*  Hollywood I mean Hollywood was already dirty anyway, right and then you add the board everything's boarded up
*  It's kind of like now it's starting to seem a little more lifely like your things open back up a little bit
*  So it's not as bad, but it's bad enough to go like oh man. This is bad
*  Well, like there's a friend of mine who is buddies with this photographer and this photographer
*  Is like he whenever shit goes down he goes out and gets photographs and videos and he got this insane
*  Video of Hollywood the very night where everybody was smashing and burning everything it is it's so crazy
*  It's so crazy this video
*  I mean, I don't want to share it because it's his personal video
*  But he's he's walking down the street and he's panning and it's just people smashing windows and things are on fire
*  And people are running out of stores with packages and and it's all happening on the street in front of the streets are covered with
*  Debris and dirt and and he's just he's just panning back and forth this camera
*  Oh my god, like this is Hollywood. This is where I drive to go tell jokes like what is happening?
*  It's man, dude. It's and it's it's it's such a beautiful city. Like you can see the beauty through the grime
*  Yeah, and it's like I
*  Don't know how it bounces back either
*  I don't know what percentage of the small businesses were already on the way out
*  Before the rioting and the looting because of the kovat fucked up so many businesses
*  They were estimating that somewhere around 40% of small businesses were gonna go under and then you light everything on fire and looting and all
*  This crazy shit and like oh my god
*  LA was hard to live in and expensive enough to live in as is well the taxes are so crazy
*  Yeah, the California state taxes like 13.5 percent
*  Texas no, um gots
*  Yeah, no zero same as we get shooters that were in the NRA
*  Yeah
*  We get crushed for property tax, yeah, but we get crushed with that too. Yeah, you know, you're right
*  Yeah, just not on specifically your house. But yeah, yeah, it's yeah, it's like look
*  There's beautiful parts of LA. There's a
*  So it's a lot of fun to this place. This there's a lot of good things. Yeah, there's a lot of good people
*  It's a lot of good people because there's a lot of people but it's one of the problems with it is there's too many folks
*  I think when you get to a size that's sort of unmanageable
*  whether it is, you know
*  New York City or Los Angeles where whenever things go sideways they go really really sideways and fast
*  Yeah, and you saw fast went from zero to 100 with Colvin like yeah
*  You know to and then not only that and that was a point that I made to with respect to firearm ownership
*  People don't understand how fast society can collapse. Yes, even if the only temporarily right it happens overnight
*  Yeah, that video came out
*  Just like that. Mm-hmm police station on fire. Yeah, and a whole city was burning
*  Yeah, and and then but people tell me that I'm ridiculous for wanting to own a firearm
*  Yeah, they're ridiculous and they look ridiculous now, you know, I mean again say it again
*  This is one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on right after it hit
*  Yeah
*  when I contacted you I was like this is the time to really talk about this stuff because
*  This is where people are more open to this
*  Idea we we live in a messy world and I know that there's a lot of good people that don't want guns
*  Like I had a conversation with this comedian friend of mine when one of the mass shooting happened
*  And he was like we just got to take away all the guns. I was like, okay
*  Well, I don't know what to say but because that's you're so off base. I don't even know what to do with this conversation
*  I know and that's the problem
*  It's so many people don't have the conversation emotionally and therefore they start spouting out what essentially is juvenile solutions same guy
*  Years later trying to buy a gun stop it
*  Now of course worried scared trying to buy a gun. What do I do trying to buy a gun?
*  I want to buy a gun the confrontable reality. What do I do? Yeah, I don't know man
*  And see but here's the messed up part about it to take California for instance
*  Like you brought it up earlier in the conversation
*  Now you have all these people who are panicking wanting to buy a gun because they feel I need one soon and fast
*  They can't get it because you have what?
*  Ten day waiting period in California, right and these are laws that they voted for right so they're just waiting nine
*  No, eight exactly every day checking looking out the window. We saw an entire city go from perfectly functional
*  To on fire in a night. Yeah
*  So it's it's so that's another reason why the whole notion of having waiting periods for me. I'm just like no
*  No, I can't get with it. It's so crazy
*  How everything went sideways like almost like I'm not a conspiracy theorist in the fact that I did
*  I don't think like I had a really dumb person tried to explain to me that
*  They think that George Floyd was murdered so that the riots could have heard that too. Oh my god
*  It's a dumbest argument of all time. Like yeah, you got a fucking sociopath who's a known sociopath
*  He just happened to have him arrest a guy that he's already had a personal with
*  It's a dumb conversation. But if if it wasn't
*  Goddamn, it's like it's perfect. It's the perfect storm you have this
*  This
*  Polemic sort of polarizing president, right and then you have this disease
*  That comes from another country and he's calling it the Chinese virus and you know
*  We're already in trade war talks with China. So you go wow imagine if China like release this virus
*  There's always crazy if you're one of those people
*  There's all these crazy conspiracies you can come up with then the George Floyd murder
*  Which is months into this horrible lockdown where everybody's losing their fucking mind
*  Yeah angry man, I was watching people driving they were driving so aggressive
*  I could feel it the tension that because when people start losing money and there's no way to get it back
*  I mean just losing their businesses through no fault of their own
*  and then on top of that you see a
*  Video of a guy getting murdered by a cop and it's a slow torture murder and it's horrific and then the fucking city explodes
*  And then what's unprecedented is that the whole world responds?
*  Like when is the whole world?
*  Crazy like good lord like and then here we are
*  Here we are two gun enthusiasts
*  Yeah, if you hate me for this now like come on man this I've you know
*  I've been a hunter for eight years and I've had guns for more than 20. I just I don't
*  I don't want anybody to die. I don't want anybody to get hurt. I don't want anybody to cry
*  I don't want anybody to feel bad. I don't I'm a sensitive person is where's it sounds. However, I'm a realist
*  Yeah, I understand humans and I understand that we are a strange animal there and we we live in this bizarre
*  state of civilization
*  That has a thin veneer that that a thin veneer that protects us all of our survival
*  Instincts and chaos and all of our our tribal instincts and our
*  Brutality that we have just under the surface and I'm very aware of that
*  you just I'm very I'm very aware of the propensity that human beings have for violence and
*  That's why I'm a gun advocate and that's why I support people like you and that's why I want to have these kind of conversations
*  Because I don't I don't think there's enough people looking at it realistically and I think there's more now and I think having a conversation
*  With someone who's so well reasoned about this is very important right now
*  Yeah, no, it's it's I don't know why or how it came about but it's just something I've become really incredibly passionate about
*  When did you first shoot a gun? Like what was the first time? How old were you? I think it was like 24 or 23
*  So you were fairly old. Oh, yeah. No, I was not pro gun. I
*  Was not pro. What kicked it off?
*  So
*  What what made you go to a range my best friend asked me to go
*  Yeah, he randomly was like hey, you want to go shoot and I was like and I was scared
*  I was more scared than I was anti gun. Were you in law school at the time? Yes. Wait, hold on
*  It's oh man stuff starts getting so blurry. I was either in the process of going to law school or was already in law school
*  I can't remember exactly. Okay, but
*  after that first shot
*  Second shot actually let me lie lie the first shot was terrified second shot. I was like, oh, yeah
*  Yeah, no, no, no, no, it's no but it's no different for me the woman dude the last time I was here I was in
*  Here I mean in California. I was in San Francisco to be specific. I
*  Was filming for my show after we finished filming. I decided to stay over for several days as kind of like a getaway. I
*  rented a
*  Porsche 911 GT3 on to row
*  Found the most room to row was like a it's like Airbnb for cars. Oh, so you rented somebody else's car
*  They should pay me a lot of money for this right now
*  Basically, yeah, you can take whatever cars you have
*  Yeah, so I found the most remote diner in San Francisco I could possibly find for my hotel
*  I rented this 911 GT3 and I drove about an hour and 30 minutes to this diner
*  Had some eggs had some oatmeal ate got back in the car drove back down the mountain
*  Went back to my hotel and then the next day I plotted out another course and I did the same shit
*  I drove down to 101 and just drove
*  And it was most exhilarating awesome shit I've ever done in my life
*  Why can't I have that type of reaction to doing that but not to shooting a firearm?
*  It's the same thing
*  Well, I think you should I don't have a problem with it at all
*  The people that do have a problem with it. It is this emotional in my opinion
*  Narrow-minded perspective. I think it's it's narrow-minded in that well, okay
*  it's I
*  Think in one way it's not narrow-minded in one way if you would want to look at it with the best perspective possible
*  You would hope that we have evolved to the point where we no longer need guns
*  No one needs guns all across the land everywhere in the world and that might and strength are no longer
*  Factors in the way people interact with each other
*  People will never know no longer threaten people's lives or break down their doors or rape people or murder people or steal from them
*  I would love that I would love that
*  Yeah, look, I think if the three of us lived in a world was just you me and Jamie
*  We wouldn't need guns to protect ourselves. Yeah, you're a nice guy. Jamie's great
*  I'm a nice guy. We wouldn't have any problems. I don't know Jamie wears his hat back
*  But you know I'm saying I mean that's the problem the problem is the unknown people that you don't love people that you don't
*  You don't know anything about them
*  And then people that look at you like an opportunity or like a victim rather than like a brother or sister
*  that's the problem with people and
*  That problem largely comes from a bunch of different factors. Yeah, and one of those factors is overpopulation
*  One of those factors is we don't need each other
*  You know necessarily as much and that you look at people that have more than you have
*  And you look at them as have somehow or another they've gotten that through some nefarious way
*  That's another perspective thing. I've noticed too. Yeah, that's a mentality that it's
*  Way more pervasive than it needs to be right the way that people look at success. I was raised
*  By my mom and I should be a fucking failure to be honest with you
*  I am like the epitome of having a background where I should be nothing
*  My mom was like look
*  If them why not you and not meaning any specific race or any specific type of people but just anything
*  If you want something and you see someone that has something that you want
*  Work and figure out a way so that you can get it that should be a motivation
*  Not something that I look down on and say well, why do they get to have that that's not fair
*  I should have that I think there's too much of that thought process and mentality in this country
*  It's a mind disease. Yeah, and and I think it's scary
*  It's scary because then what it does is it vilify success
*  And so now instead of set success being something that people aspire to it's now become something that people attack
*  Yes, and I think that's incredibly dangerous
*  Incredibly dangerous. Yeah, I agree and it's a it's a very weak-minded perspective to this one
*  I mean, there's different kinds of success too, right?
*  This is success of someone who built a business versus success of someone who's doing some shady shit with which is true with loans
*  And you know and and fucking over people with you know
*  Subprime mortgages and that there's there's different things that make you successful
*  You know, there's the wolf of Wall Street money that you get from ripping people off
*  But I think that goes without being said though. Yes, that's pretty blatant, but it's also like the gun problem and people are messy. Yeah
*  You know, if everybody was like you no one have a problem with guns
*  It's it's a messy problem that comes with just human beings because we're just weird people are weird
*  No, you're right. And I but here's the funny thing though
*  Like I have this kind of utopic vision of this this like mass
*  education on firearms and the reason I have it and I know it's a little naive to a degree but
*  I do believe like the gun changed the way I looked at the world and I think the gun
*  Like a lot of like, you know, how did it change the way you look at the world?
*  It taught me to even though my mom really kind of beat it into my head the gun almost served as like a physical
*  symbol of self-reliance
*  Not that I don't need anyone
*  But to trust in my own ability to find a way to deal with any problems that I have
*  Sometimes that ability means go to somebody who's better at it than you that can help you do something to learn
*  Exactly, or it means find the strength within yourself to overcome an issue that you're dealing with
*  The gun showed me and I don't need to have taught me that it taught me responsibility
*  because now we are talking however, I want to Disney fight it as far as the
*  Sporting enthusiast aspect of it. It's still something it's life and death. That is a tool of life and death
*  That can be used to take a life and can be used to save one
*  So because of that that that was a big responsibility, especially when I'm carrying that very thing on me everywhere I go
*  So it had me really appreciate life more. I started to value life a lot more
*  Most people think you get a gun and all of a sudden you just want to take life
*  No, like the I tell people this all the time the day I have to use the gun to defend myself
*  I'm gonna need therapy
*  Flat out I'm gonna need therapy because it's made me value life
*  They're not that I didn't value life before
*  But it's something that that brings it to the forefront of your consciousness
*  When you have a gun and you understand what that gun can be used to do
*  Hmm, and so that happens to way more people than people realize
*  Most people think that people get a gun and they just become reckless murderers
*  We want to kill everybody when in reality a number of stories of people out there who I
*  Know a guy who the firearm helped him get out of his depression. I
*  Know I know it sounds crazy. It sounds crazy, but he'll he'll tell you the speech about it
*  And he's and he's very he should be I mean he grew up in the streets of st. Louis and
*  He didn't he didn't have a good life
*  He was young and he was depressed
*  But when he got into firearms that allowed him to deal with his depression because it found something he was passionate about
*  It's not that is crazy
*  But that's something that does actually work when you find something you really love and pursue it and you get some like
*  That's one of the problems I have with the term depression like boy. That's a blanket that you throw over so many different
*  Factors yeah, like what it's almost like the term drugs like if you say you on drugs. Yeah, I drank a cup of coffee
*  I mean really or are you on heroin?
*  It's weird yeah
*  The depression is in many ways like that in that there are people and I know these people that have a real problem with their brain
*  And the way their brain produces chemicals same way some people have problems with their liver
*  Some people have they're born with ineffective lungs. These are all just parts of being a person
*  Yeah
*  and some people have like legitimate issues that I think they need medication for and then there's other people that
*  They just don't feel good and they call it depression because their life sucks
*  And their job sucks and no one wants have sex with them and they don't have any money
*  So they're depressed and they say I'm suffering from depression and so what do you do with that?
*  Well some of those people get on medication
*  And I don't know if that's really the answer
*  Because there's a lot of those people that I know that have discovered jujitsu or discovered other things that they yoga even
*  Physical things often because they release endorphins and because they're actually healthy for you
*  But also you get passionate about something and you see this improvement and when you were talking about that with guns
*  I was trying to describe to someone why I like shooting guns
*  I said one of the reasons why I like it because I'm not very good at it
*  Yeah, you know, I like learning things. I like learning all kinds of things
*  Yeah
*  I'm sure when I started at a YouTube channel when I started my YouTube channel
*  I would go like I started with a thing called IDPA Diaries, which is like a shooting competition
*  Oh was bad, but you did it openly. Yes, which is great
*  So people can see oh this guy isn't just because I see you now
*  It's like if I didn't know anything about guns, yeah, you think it's so good
*  This is crazy and I see that's what I wanted when I started doing it
*  I wanted people because I was like I'm a city boy. I didn't grow up with guns
*  So when I started putting my when I started my channel, I was like, okay
*  I know there are a lot of people who are like me, right?
*  And so I want them to be able to feel to be able to relate to the idea of okay
*  I'm starting afresh and I'm not that good
*  So the YouTube channel was almost a way to chronalize my growth and
*  If you start from video one and you go to my last video
*  You can literally watch the entire progression and that's what I wanted it to be
*  So I knew and I was it was hard because I knew I was going to look bad
*  Yeah, real bad and I started with video one for IDPA Diaries
*  And then as time went on I stopped doing the Diaries
*  But I was still shooting in front of the camera and even to this day
*  I'm known for not editing out my misses
*  Mmm good. You're still gonna see me miss and there are some people and it's hard
*  I'm not gonna lie. It's hard because I do so much shooting now
*  There's an expectation that I should be good
*  So when I go out and do a gun review and I'm missing with a particular gun and then I see comments man
*  You couldn't hit shit with that gun. You don't know it does hit my ego a little bit. Don't read the comments
*  That's the key yeah, I mean you're on the right path you have great content just don't read the comments
*  Do your best don't read the comments. I think I know and I've started doing it actually I've cut it
*  I've cut it by 50% so important man. It's so important for mental health
*  Yeah, it really is it really is because you don't realize how much of an effect it's having until it starts having an effect
*  Yeah, and then you're like, why am I am I such in a shitty mood all the time?
*  It's just a terrible way to communicate with people
*  Yeah, you know through through little text messages on comments and you don't even know them
*  You know anything about them and they're saying mean shit to you
*  Your dasity of anonymity is insane it is it's a great way to put it
*  It's a great way to put it the audacity of an enemy. Yeah. Yeah anonymous people can get away with a lot a lot
*  It's also it's like a shitty way to communicate with people personally
*  It's bad for you to shit on people like anonymous little comments on someone's Instagram page or the YouTube channel
*  It's just shitty. It's shitty for you. It's bad for you
*  You know, like I said before like I grew up my friends are assholes
*  So I know how to give it back but if I but if I do it now I'm a boy
*  Right. That's the problem if you give it back and then people will find you as a target and then they start coming after you
*  Yeah, you can't do that. You can't do that. Yeah, it's um, you're better off just ignoring it
*  Yeah, just keep moving do your best keep moving. That's that's that's the plan now. Yeah, that's the plan
*  Cuz I mean it's so the platform's so big now to try to let all that in
*  Like I'm gonna lose like it's gonna affect me emotional how many Instagram followers you have right now
*  624,000 imagine that in a room
*  Imagine a room with six imagine like the amount of like how many like a giant football arena is like what Jamie you would know this
*  What's like a big-ass football arena?
*  Okay, imagine six of them bitches
*  six of them and that's
*  You fucking lose you can't hit shit with that gun imagine all that number there's too many people that's unmanageable
*  Here's how bad it how bad it was. I
*  Was reading Instagram comments the YouTube comments where I have 1.4 million Facebook where I have 1.3 million
*  Dude one hundred and eight thousand on it's on Twitter. So I was going back and forth reading all of that
*  Oh my god, and and and I was just I hit a point when Dallas like dude
*  This is not healthy
*  So Facebook that's the entire city of Austin
*  Fuck you
*  It's not you can't do that no one can manage that no they can't yeah, it's just too many people
*  It's too much opportunity for people to suck
*  Which is true. Yeah, it's true face-to-face is the best way to talk to people always if I'm gonna be honest
*  I think some of it is my ego where I think I can handle it
*  It's like this false sense of
*  Stability that my ego has it's like I can handle I can handle I can handle it but
*  The war of attrition is real. It's still energy. Yeah coming at you whether you like it or not
*  It's still energy it is and if it's negative, it's gonna feel bad
*  Yep
*  It might not feel as bad as it will for someone who's mentally unstable and I've seen some comedians who just get really crushed by comments
*  It's horrible. Yeah, man, like they come on the show and then they read I go don't read the comments
*  Don't know Rawlings when he was on with the RZA from Wu Tang
*  I say after the well Donnell is just he's a wild motherfucker and he's funny as shit and he's always loud and
*  He's just crazy Donnell's crazy, but he was talking over the RZA a bunch of times
*  I know they were gonna get mad and he I love Donnell
*  So when when he was doing I was just laughing my ass off. I thought it was awesome
*  Oh, that was a great podcast and then at the end I said don't read the comments. I hugged him like oh, that was great
*  Don't read the comments. He's like you fucking told me he told me not to read the car. It's hard dude
*  Sometimes it's really hard because you know what it is sometimes and it's your own
*  Fault because what you would you go to do is to get your ego stroke. That's really what you're doing
*  Yeah, you're really going on there hoping everyone was like man. He was awesome
*  And then you get up there you're like you suck and you're like, oh shit
*  Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'm too polarizing to read the comments because people either love me or they fuck. Yeah, which is true
*  I've learned that yeah, it's weird. So I just go okay. I'm just gonna keep doing what I do
*  Something's going right. I think I don't know man. It's just a little bit
*  I mean, I think I think you could step it up a little bit, you know
*  Turn it up a little bit
*  Try to do my best. I really am. I mean, I'm not I'm not a fan of me. Yeah, you know, I don't like what I do
*  I think I could always do better
*  You know, it's funny a lot of people don't realize that people who put themselves out like, you know
*  funny kind of like you and I so fun, so like
*  Even though we may kind of get affected by your comments
*  They're never anywhere close as to it being as bad as what we tell ourselves in our heads
*  Oh for sure. We are I had the worst self-talk on the planet. Yeah, like it's bad. It's toxic
*  I do too. Yeah, but I think that's also what drives you. Yeah, you know, it's just like I have a good self-love too
*  like I'm
*  I'm
*  More because I have a problem in that I'm a look. I don't want to say I'm too driven
*  but I'm I get very
*  Focused on things and especially things I'm trying to get good at yeah and things I take seriously whether it's stand-up or whether it's
*  Doing this podcast or other things that I do UFC commentary
*  And so if I fall short, I'm very hard on myself
*  Yeah, so that if I read other people that also are mad at me for falling short and it piles on it's like listen
*  Man, I'm right there with you. You know, I do you like you're not gonna get an argument from me
*  Other whether or not I suck like I'm right there with you. Yeah, I'm pretty pretty terrible everything
*  I've ever done wrong. I'm fucking furious at myself for yep. I'm the same way
*  Yeah, I'm the same way and it's like it's nothing's ever enough. No nothing's I mean I can have any any type and this can't be healthy
*  Any type of thing I succeed at or anything that I do that is a milestone that people are like, oh, this is awesome
*  It lasts maybe ten seconds and I'm like, alright, you need to do better
*  Yes, but that's also why you're really good at things and this is another thing that you see from people that are mediocre
*  And if it infuriates me
*  Where they come up with excuses for why they fall short?
*  Yeah, they come up for excuses for why they didn't succeed in their chosen profession
*  They come up with excuses for why other people do well
*  But they've been ostracized or they've been cast out or they never were accepted or they were treated like a second-class citizen
*  No, you were mediocre. You're mediocre and you're not critical on yourself. Yeah, and I don't you know, I don't wish that on anybody
*  That's truth. I mean it is what it is and I and the thing is you have to get past I call it the Eagle Wall
*  You have to get past the Eagle Wall because yeah, they're just some shit
*  You're just not good at right
*  And so it's either one of two things you either
*  Pivot find something you're good at and go that direction or if you're willing to put any effort
*  Figure out how to get better at what you're not good at right and then and then apply those things now
*  It's gonna be hard. It's gonna suck
*  You still may not even get to the same level or degree as somebody else who's naturally talented in that in that sense
*  But what's the alternative you bitch about it? And like you said complain complain when I see people
*  Particularly this happens when you see people who are not very good commenting on people who are successful
*  They start saying this is one of the reasons why I could never make it because the people that made their sellouts
*  Or they're this or they're that and like, okay
*  Yeah, is that you know who doesn't leave comments like that winners. This is so true. That's the facts. That's the thing
*  Dave Chappelle's not going on fucking Twitter talking shit about people. This is that's the facts
*  It's the people who are really successful are the ones who are analyzing themselves
*  Looking at their own work and keep moving doesn't mean you don't fail doesn't mean you don't fuck up
*  Don't make mistakes and they think of the difference though is you do it
*  Publicly. Yeah, you mess up publicly. Oh, yeah, and that's a lot to take in and like even like when I went on
*  When I was on I mean when I was on bill maher and I was on a roundtable
*  I didn't think I did a good job. I don't it's fucking almost impossible to do a good job in that goddamn roundtable
*  It was it was probably my worst showings now for reasons that I think I went into it thinking I
*  Could I went into it like a lawyer I thought I can go on reason and then be understand
*  I was out class because they had a great command of using emotion and clapping. Well, there's that yeah
*  Yeah, I don't think it's a good way to communicate and I said it was bill on the show and he's trying to talk me
*  Doing the show and I think I agreed to it, but then I found ways to get out of it
*  This is why man talking one-on-one is hard enough. Like you have a thought sometimes you're expanding and I have a thought
*  I'm holding on to it. Yeah, but then you keep talking and I don't know when to get it in there
*  I lose it now when there's three other fucking people and they're all trying to get sound bites
*  They're hoping are gonna be on YouTube. It's all performative
*  It is a lot of it a lot of is performative and then on top of it
*  It really is performative because there's a fucking audience. Yeah, you're right
*  Yeah, and they're all liberal and they're all clapping and cheering and they're all and which they should be they're his fans
*  There's nothing wrong with that. There are couple times. I wanted to be like I'd make a point and I'm like really you're not gonna clap
*  One thing to perform if you're doing stand-up or singing a song or something like that in front of a large crowd
*  That's one thing. Yeah, but like having conversations in front of crowds
*  Like a weird animal man weird added element and you're you're you're appealing to others to chime in and reinforce your thoughts
*  Yeah, no, you know, you're absolutely right now
*  I will forever ever ever be grateful that he gave me the opportunity to go into that lines then
*  Because it's a place that I think a lot of pro-gun people haven't been able to get going to
*  Hopefully I communicated in a manner that was that resonated with a lot of people in the same same way here
*  it's
*  I'd be lying if I said I did not
*  Value the ability to have the for the time being within this two hour three hour space to have access to your audience
*  at the same time because I
*  Don't understand why I mean I understand why but I'm just passionate about this
*  in a way that sometimes even I have a hard time articulating and
*  So when I see all of these new people because I know your audience is very vast
*  Like I have a base there's a base in my audience, right?
*  that's gun people and a lot of them very conservative and
*  with your audience it gives me the ability to speak to a
*  wider gap of people who would otherwise never even look in my direction because of what I talk about and
*  So it and aren't that many platforms that are available right now that are willing to open their doors
*  To the opposite perspective because you got it you made me a smart guy
*  You know this this puts you in a very peculiar situation
*  You you can end up looking really bad
*  Because you're literally confronting and testing out all of your ideas right in front of your audience that thinks you know everything
*  Right and so many people aren't willing to do that
*  Because they're worried about looking bad
*  Which is why I give mad props to Bill Maher as well
*  Because there aren't too many platform most people just want to sit in their echo chambers right yellow the audience and say all right
*  Right yeah
*  So I can't I'm a hard person think about any other type of platforms that may have a different perspective that would let me come
*  on like this
*  And that's just me being honest. Well. I think it's important to talk to people that have all sorts of different ideas
*  You know the thing there's the thing going on today
*  Where people talk about giving someone a platform you shouldn't be giving them access to your platform
*  I'm like well
*  What the fuck is the purpose of a platform if it's not to test out ideas if it's not like if you want to talk to
*  Someone I mean I'm not talking about someone like who's in the KKK
*  But talking to people that have
*  controversial viewpoints
*  One of the best ways to sort those viewpoints out is to challenge them
*  And in fact there's a lot of people that would support a lot of people that I've had on where I've
*  Confronted them on their ideas and it they lost a lot of fans because of it because because these ideas now fall apart
*  Under scrutiny yeah under someone who could talk to you for long periods of time and just start go okay
*  Well, why do you think that yeah, and then they say this and that and then you go
*  But where's that coming from yeah?
*  And then they see this man and then as you get deeper and deeper you get to the basement and you go
*  This is a shit. There's nothing in here
*  It's kind of me, but I think the problem too is is that people don't understand you can't know everything right so for instance
*  We started talking halfway through we started talking about climate change right my my my knowledge of climate change is very limited
*  very limited
*  You're gonna hit a point like dude. I don't know yeah, well some minds pretty limited, too
*  Yeah, so but I think problem is some people have this expectation
*  Well, they they tell themselves where I have to know this because people expect me to know yeah
*  And if I say that I don't know then I'm gonna lose and look I made I don't know maybe there's some die-hard climate
*  Maybe you know somebody's like an argument that says okay. Well. Yeah, that's because most people don't follow you for climate change right sure
*  This is the climate change argument to me is one of things that's really fascinating about it
*  I think and I mean this in a very
*  This is a hard way to grasp this, but this is this is the way I'm gonna try to parse this out I
*  Think it's a control issue
*  And I don't think it's a control issue and meaning that people are trying to control people and that people are trying to gain
*  Control of one very small factor in our mortality, and I think it's good to do that
*  I think it's good to make the world cleaner
*  And I think it's good to use clean energy, and I think it's good to use solar
*  I think all these things are good, but I think we're fucked anyway
*  I think we're fucked anywhere from because of solar flares and volcanoes and earthquakes and tsunamis and
*  asteroids and
*  Pandemics I think we're fucked anyway, and I think if you look at the history of the world
*  There's been radical changes before we ever came about whether it's asteroid impacts or massive fucking ice
*  Ages are all kinds of crazy shit that's killed off people from the beginning of fucking people
*  There's been a lot of them and if you think
*  That's switching totally to solar is gonna stop all that other shit from happening. You got another thing coming
*  It doesn't mean that solar is not good doesn't mean that cleaning the air is not good
*  I think these are very important factors, but the idea that it's gonna save us, but that's why I say
*  That's why I say I think based on my limited knowledge
*  It's about respect to like the New Deal and things of that nature
*  I think some of it if not more of it seems to me economically subversive. I don't know
*  I don't know about that. I've heard a lot of criticisms about the Green New Deal
*  Yeah, most of them from were from Republicans. I haven't heard any criticisms
*  I would like to hear criticisms from Democrats that don't support it
*  But I think the the idea behind green energy is great. I do too. It'd be wonderful
*  Yeah, you know I hate electric cars less pollution
*  You know the real it was really crazy is the best energy is really fucking nuclear
*  There's the least amount of impact just they did it pretty sucky back in the Fukushima days
*  Didn't know what they were doing. I mean they they the energy that they have now when it comes to new
*  There's really fucking good. Look what we do very small impact fucking
*  Our
*  Massive city ships, I can't believe I forgot the name of the ready called our
*  You know big warships
*  Carriers aircraft submarines as well. I mean that that's an it's insane. Yeah, they're nuclear. Yeah, like I
*  Said this is out of my wheelhouse, you know, I got a business partner
*  He's the electrical engineer may be able to talk to you about that crap
*  But I don't know about it either when they say nuclear submarine that that goes in one ear and she
*  flying out the other of my stupid champ brain I
*  Only know about them in the fascinated by him from like I watch it like I tend to like
*  Drink and then watch like documentaries on Netflix about World War two and stuff like that
*  Yeah, I oddly watch a lot of Hitler documentaries because the manner in which the people
*  Bought in this shit. So fascinating me very scary way
*  Scary this is a strong leader. Yeah the amount of power a strong leader has over whether it's
*  Kim Jong-un or you know any that's the thing I would keep saying to people when they don't think that all that shit can happen
*  Yeah, man. I'm like listen
*  They're human beings in 2020 and human beings in 2020 are under the control of a military dictatorship
*  That's that's happening right now and it's happening in more than one country
*  It's a it's a style of civilization that exists and has existed since the beginning of time
*  I don't want it to happen here. People don't understand our our way of living
*  It's still a baby, yep, it's still a baby compared to the other structures that are out there in the world
*  Yeah, and that's an experiment. Yeah, it's experiment and self-government and and you know, a lot of people like this experiment should be canceled
*  Let's get rid of it
*  Start from scratch and do the same shit that didn't work before. I don't know man
*  I mean, I don't think we could start a new country, you know
*  I mean, I know this trying to Chaz is supposed to be a new country, but bitch you didn't even building those buildings
*  You're basically doing the exact same thing we did to the Native Americans didn't even take a week they built borders
*  Yeah, I had people with guns
*  They had bad cops they had they beeped this dude out for taking pictures like come on man
*  You'd be so pissed if the cops did that. Oh
*  Human issue I think humans have control over humans. I've told the story forgive me if you've heard it before
*  I used to work as a security guard for a short period of time when I was 19 years old
*  I worked at Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts. It's this Mansfield, Massachusetts
*  Amphitheater that all these concerts are played. I saw John Bon Jovi there or Bon Jovi the band
*  I saw I saw Bill Cosby perform there. I saw a lot of when I was working there. I saw a lot of shit and
*  I developed in a very short period of time
*  most of the guys that I I got the job because one of the guys that I trained with at my type one no school was
*  Security guard he said hey you want this job. It pays really good. It's real easy. You get to see concerts
*  Yeah, and I was like, okay
*  So he hired they hired like a bunch of black belts need to be security
*  So it was yeah, it was like a bunch of us that like black belts in martial arts
*  Okay, yeah, like mixed martial arts or like I was talking about no, okay. This is like before this was
*  1986 I was 19 so it was 86
*  Yeah, it was like just a bunch of karate people, yeah, right so we're out there and we almost instantly
*  Develop this us versus their mentality almost instantly we would yell at people when they were doing things wrong
*  We treat them like shit and I recognize that I was like, wow, this is weird like instantly. I'll become like
*  I've developed this attitude at these people because they didn't want to listen
*  They kept doing things they're not supposed to do and you're supposed to enforce it and you get mad and you do have some power
*  You have the security jacket. I'm so stupid. You have a walkie-talkie the first day I was there this kid stole a
*  Golf cart first day and this guy who was the head security guy
*  His name was Ali cat tackled this dude and beat the shit out of him with a walkie-talkie
*  He beat this guy in the head with a walkie-talkie my first day on the job. I was like, oh, okay
*  So that's how we're doing
*  Again, I'm a fucking child. I'm 19 years old. I'm a moron
*  I don't know anything and but I was smart enough to recognize like this is weird
*  Like this this attitude that we have all developed as a security team
*  This us versus them now magnify that times fucking hundred million and you get cops bingo
*  Yeah, it wasn't there a social experiment done like this famous social experiment with you like
*  Yeah, they immediately started abusing the inmates treating them like shit and it's funny cuz it's like so like I watch a lot
*  Temple, you know, he calls he calls it cause it LARPing when they
*  This is funny cuz it's like how quickly how quickly they relegate themselves to doing the exact same shit
*  That they were critiquing and grits 100% they're pretending to be progressive and they have borders
*  Yeah, like let everybody in you fucks, but they wanted to control it. Well, how do you control things you control things with borders?
*  How do you reinforce your ideas? Well, you have to beat people up
*  It's fucking crazy it's like these are it's like you're doing it's almost like a Petri dish you're doing experiments
*  Yeah, this is a human lab and in this this lab is failing. I know people think
*  like
*  people watch you do what you do and
*  Especially they don't realize you've been doing this for years and they're like he doesn't do shit but sit behind a microphone and talk
*  All right
*  All right
*  I want you to come on camera find somebody who you even kind of sort of agree with
*  Have a three-hour conversation with them and then keep it engaging during the entire conversation
*  And see how long you last and then do that multiple times a day
*  It's not that easy, but it's something you get better at. Yeah, I know that's what's weird
*  But you got better at it through repetition. Yes, and so and funny we kind of talked about this the last time I was here
*  And the problem is is that when you only watch the end result of your repetition
*  And getting to where you are now
*  people
*  over simplify what it is that you do and
*  So what happens is they think they can do it better
*  Even though they haven't engaged in the same level of repetition or thought process to really think it out
*  So what I think is happening is you got all these kids with these grandiose ideas, right?
*  They go to these schools and teach me these grandiose ideas from first of time like this is why we can do it
*  That's right. We can do it and then they're like, yeah
*  Give us the country we can do it a lot better than they can. Oh
*  Really? Okay
*  well
*  You see the result of that
*  You have Seattle and things go shit like that
*  And the funny thing is it's going to shit while still having the support structure of an entire city
*  Yeah
*  It's not like they don't have the resources of the other of the city to be provided for them. It's basically a tumor
*  Basically, yeah, and so it's like if I was the government I'd be pumping guns into them
*  But you guys need guns you should get explosives you guys here's some
*  Anthrax
*  Trying to collapse it and the crazy thing is
*  The founding fathers understood that human nature that there's always if there's a vacuum of power
*  There's always going to be someone or something willing to fill it. Yes, and then left unchecked
*  It will become a black hole of power
*  Which is why they tried to organize our country the way that they did by separating the powers to service this check against other
*  Other entities people don't really appreciate
*  the beauty of that because they think that they can go into things altruistically and
*  Think that okay. No, I'll get the taste of power
*  You think money is intoxicating
*  Power is a whole other thing like you pointed out even on a minor level of being a security guard at a concert
*  It's intoxicated. Yeah now imagine being in charge of millions of people, right?
*  Oh, come on, man, or being a general that can lead people into war. Yeah
*  You could decide to just fucking light up this city. Yeah nuts. It's nuts
*  and people I don't think people have a big enough appreciation for
*  How intoxicating power really is exactly and I think that's one of the reasons why you need a
*  Stringent evaluation process before you let someone be a police officer
*  Yeah, instead of just like trying to recruit people it should be something where you don't want to recruit people you want to say
*  Listen man this job ain't for you
*  You know you got you got to jump through hoops and ladders to get this fucking job
*  I think the problem though is it's we kind of have to measure that against
*  The problem is that means there'll be less cops yes, and we don't exactly have an over-infested
*  We don't thought like we have too many cops now, right? So it's like it's like how do we balance that?
*  Right, and then what do we do?
*  But the places where they want to defund the cops where they're they're voting
*  Overwhelmingly in Minneapolis to defund the police department. I mean, I don't know what that means. Let them eat cake
*  Because it's like if you what do you do when they're doing it to themselves, I don't know
*  I don't know but this night there's good people that live in Minneapolis. That's very true. They're really doing that
*  Yeah, and you're right because there's a lot of people that like in the gun debate or in the gun discussion
*  But you know when we talk about places like California and people like oh, it's not fair
*  The gun laws here suck and a lot of people who like live in Texas or live in more freer states like we'll move
*  It's not that easy. No, it's not always that easy. So you're right
*  So I take that back because you're right
*  There are a lot of people in these places that don't really have a say and they can't just meet they can't just leave
*  Well, especially now right because post-covid most people are broke
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people that didn't work at all for three fucking whole months. They went through all their savings
*  You're right
*  Try to move now and then also where's the jobs?
*  Where the fuck are you gonna go? Yeah, if you're stuck in Minneapolis and they defund the cops like oh my god
*  You better buy some bullets
*  You better get get some guns and get some bullets and get some friends who also have guns and form a small mob
*  Form a small militia
*  But you don't need that
*  The founding fathers had muskets
*  How much do you hate that argument?
*  They wrote that back when they had muskets
*  But then we'll be so quick to invalidate the notion that well, yeah, they also wrote it when they only had quillpins
*  It's true, you know
*  Parchment yeah, they're right on like so where we're like candlelight bingo. Yeah, right fucking dope
*  Well, they know they have no internet
*  It's amazing how really well thought out their their system of government was seriously consider the fact that we still use it in
*  2020 I think it's I think it's
*  Beautiful it is not perfect. No, not perfect at all. Nothing with people involved is perfect
*  It's not exactly nothing
*  and I and I said that I used to say that when I was in law school and I talked about the law the practice of
*  law and the idea that I was like
*  Theoretically the justice system is perfect
*  It's just executed by imperfect people. Yes, the concepts are perfect
*  They're just when you add the element of people who are imperfect
*  Then that inherently is what creates the imperfection in the system, right?
*  And the system is designed to sort of mitigate the imperfections of people exactly and it's done a pretty fucking good job
*  About how goddamn old it is. Yeah. Yeah now like I said, they're there, you know people do fall through the cracks and then there are
*  You know, there are some things that are deteriorating as a result of it and those things need to be addressed
*  but by and large
*  People need to understand that like it's this
*  244 years old or whatever the fuck it is
*  Like goddamn, it's old. It's really old. It's crazy
*  I guess it's young compared to other
*  Oh, yeah, those systems those fucking dummies
*  Think about how they're doing it. Look at what's going on in China. That's the oldest one we got. Yeah, it's crazy
*  Man, the government and all businesses are intertwined
*  Inexorably you want to run a corporation great you work for the fucking government
*  You imagine because you imagine and people are wondering why they don't want to let Huawei in like I've had people explain that to me
*  Companies that have been accused of using third-party backdoors to steal data and espionage and all kinds of shit
*  That's why they won't let them sell their cell phones here
*  Like that's a part of the that's a branch of the Chinese government. They're not really a corporation
*  It's like free and independent like Apple or or you know anything
*  I don't even know how independent they are and you get this size
*  Yeah at some point hey
*  There is a there is a such thing as being too big
*  Yeah, yeah
*  well
*  especially when you're dealing with information like with Google and you know and
*  Apple and you're collecting so much data and the government would love to take a look at that stuff
*  We could save a lot of lives. We could just see what this man's browser history is
*  Oh the beautiful pretext to tyranny we can save lives
*  That is that that is yeah, man. I can't get down with that. I know I can't get down with it either
*  But it's like what do we do what do we do to keep it from sliding into the abyss?
*  You couldn't have made five months ago, but now people like
*  Hmm it's a bittersweet
*  it's very bittersweet because I
*  Hate that it had to come to this for people to kind of start realizing it right, but I can't be too surprised
*  I've been preaching it for how long now that this could possibly happen, right?
*  So it's kind of I shouldn't be too surprised, but it's still kind of bittersweet
*  My only thing is right now is I just I just for all the new people I
*  implore you
*  Go out. I know I know times are hard money's tight
*  But if you have the ability it bare minimum get on YouTube and just gorge
*  There's so much information even though YouTube has done a good job of trying to like, you know
*  Filter shit out. You can still search you can still get there. You can just search literally search what you want your thinking
*  They're definitely not promoting you. Yeah, definitely not promoting. Yeah. No like this this video will never hit the trending
*  Section of YouTube. No, you know what else didn't know Elon Musk
*  Well, but he's he's a controversial yeah, so they decide what trends and what doesn't trend yeah
*  Yeah, I like Elon. I love him. He's awesome. Yeah, I still I need I still need
*  I think we should have a conversation where I can sit down with Elon and talk to him about these electric cars, though
*  What do you say to him there he makes awesome electric cars, bro
*  Can you make can you make a non electric car as awesome as the?
*  No, I know I know I'm being facetious
*  I think you got a hold of one of them roadsters when they come out you'd be all in I don't doubt
*  I don't doubt that keep in mind. Keep my I'm telling you I'm being willingly stubborn about this. I know
*  With you a lot of my friends are right with you to a lot of my friends like no, no
*  I need an exhaust note. I need a rumble. I need to feel it. Yeah, I get it. I get it
*  It's it's magical man. There's something to it. That's undeniable. It's also very American
*  Yeah
*  A v8. Whoa, that's American as fuck when I drive my Corvette my 65 that I feel like a goddamn bald eagle
*  You know, it's like that's as American as it gets
*  65 Corvette
*  You can't beat it man, no, you can't be can't be also you can shoot and beat it but that's up there too
*  That's another thing that people don't want to hear
*  No, I don't want to hear that but it's there's a thrill to shooting I mean think about it like
*  Like I've taken some courses like of course I take in New Mexico
*  We're shooting out to 600 sometimes a thousand meters
*  That's crazy naughty. What's so far and it's but then you also talk about how beautiful it is
*  People love long-range shooting. They get very addicted. I'm getting there when you get to a thousand yards
*  What's the amount of time between boom and dink man?
*  It's it's
*  Extremely noticeable, but here's where we're really trippy
*  I don't know the exact seconds because it all depends on you're talking about different bullet speeds
*  We should tell people what dink means. You're hitting a metal target. Yeah, so
*  The crazy thing is when you're watching it through your optic you see the impact trail
*  Yes, you see the vapor trail and then you see the impact but you don't hear anything and then you see it
*  Ding and you're like whoa
*  Takes time for it to come back. Yeah, I can sound travel slower. Yeah, it's crazy
*  Great, so the bullets literally traveling faster than speed of sound people realize that yeah, and it's naughty man
*  And it's and then you take that you couple that with being in a beautiful environment
*  Oh my gosh, you can't beat it. Yeah, well, I've shot at the range. I've really only shot
*  Rifles up to like 200 yards and that you hear boom dink. Yeah, so there is a difference though
*  Yeah, you still do you still get the delay because otherwise you wouldn't even hear the dink
*  Yeah, you just drown out by the boom which is how which a lot of times is like that's how suppressors work
*  Because people think suppressors make things super super super quiet
*  They really don't what because all the suppressor doing is it's it's mitigating the noise at the muzzle
*  Right and people don't realize that when a bullet breaks the sound barrier you get a crack
*  So when you shoot a gun typically speaking you're hearing two sounds at once
*  You're hearing the bullet leave the muzzle and then you're hearing the crack of the bullet break the sound barrier is traveling that fast
*  So it's like a kakow, but it's happening at what it sounds like it's happening at once auditorily
*  right
*  so when you put a suppressor on it people are surprised because
*  Once it mitigates the noise at the muzzle all you're hearing is the sound of the action if it's not a bolt action
*  And then you're hearing the bullet break the sound barrier, right?
*  And so it's it's kind of kind of cool actually when you when you hear it now granted
*  You don't want to do that too much because still damaging to your ears
*  That's what I realized that what about a suppressor with subsonic so that's the only one where it actually gets really damn quiet
*  No, but the problem is is unless you're shooting a bolt action the sound of that bolt smacking back and forth
*  It's loud as hell too. Mm-hmm. What about a pistol same thing cuz you
*  Yeah, you get you get the sound of the other slide racking back and forth
*  So unless you're shooting a bolt action you want to go you want to get as quiet as possible use a bolt action
*  Well, it's actually with subsonic rounds the opposite of a suppressor is a muzzle break and I have a rifle with a muzzle break
*  Yeah, and it mitigates the kick. Yeah, but it also oh, it's so loud
*  We get mad
*  Yeah
*  Because you got cuz you're you're outside of the cone of the blast right and so everybody on the side of you is getting hit by
*  That last yeah, man. It's nuts man. They're really loud. It makes shooting a gun so much more enjoyable
*  Yeah, it's like 50% less recoil. Yeah. Yeah really feels like so it's like either one
*  Suppressors do the same thing suppresses mitigate the recoil too
*  So okay, so you can go suppressor or you can go now and I tell people all the time the whole suppressor thing
*  I think that's a that's a health issue. I
*  Think so too. I think it's healthy for your ears. Yeah. Yeah, like it's loud man
*  Like people don't realize they have this ignorant idea that people are gonna sneak up on people shoot him
*  No one's gonna hear anything. You mean the same way people do with knives. Yeah
*  But I mean they think it's gonna be like the movies
*  Happen like that. No, it's not it's pretty loud. It's like I told you like I don't shoot when I shoot suppressed
*  I still wear ear protection. Oh, yeah
*  Like people in my videos like why are you wearing ear protection?
*  And you're allowed they hunt with suppressors and they do it out of courtesy for the other people. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean look it really would be good for people if they had suppressor. Yeah, but it's a thing in California
*  I think they're totally elite. Yeah. Oh, no, you can't suppress them
*  But I think it's also an ignorant thing
*  I think it's people that don't understand because you have guns because you have people making policies based on movies, right?
*  movies
*  Well in all due defense, this is where we actually make the movies so
*  They used to make movies here they're making less of them and less of them here because of taxes taxes
*  Yeah, they're eating it. California's eating itself. Yeah, it is now like I don't understand that it's such a beautiful place
*  It is beautiful. It'll be alright. It'll bounce back
*  Maybe as soon as I get the fuck out. I
*  Don't know I don't know but I think the suppressor thing is a really dumb argument
*  I don't know but they're trying to do almost everything to limit the amount of
*  Options that someone who wants to have a gun has here
*  They're saying that's another thing that people don't talk about because people are talking about
*  Oh, it's just it's just a lot of make it a little bit harder
*  Well that that shit aggregates. Mm-hmm
*  And at a certain point what you start doing start pricing people out of the market, right?
*  And so if you start adding because all these laws they're not they're not free. Mm-hmm
*  Like background checks aren't free. People don't realize that right? They're not free
*  So you have all these little these little fees and taxes and all this stuff
*  You and I not gonna have a problem paying for them, but you know who will people live in shitty environments and don't have a lot of money
*  That's who's gonna have a problem buying guns for protection who arguably probably need them more, right?
*  And people don't understand or think about that or people don't understand. Oh, well, these are just reasonable laws. There's nothing unreasonable
*  Yeah, but see here's the problem you stack them on top of each other
*  It just becomes more of a barrier to firearm ownership
*  A lot of times a lot of these laws are designed to make it so hard and annoying to own a gun that you just don't
*  Want to do it. Mm-hmm. It's just too much and people are like why don't you like mandated training?
*  Well because I've already seen what they've done with other laws
*  So all that's gonna happen is they're gonna start off with saying okay you need three hours of mandated training
*  Then it's gonna be four. There's gonna be seven then another shooting will happen 20
*  now as
*  Somebody who's an entrepreneur who can generally speaking make their schedule. Maybe they may be able to do that somebody working two jobs
*  Four or five to nine they can't take there's no way they're gonna be able to satisfy that
*  You know and people don't think about the real implications of that and so and then even even then even from a
*  an inner city perspective, right
*  People who are talking about policing that that we police the inner city too much
*  Well, where do you think they're gonna go and enforce these laws?
*  If we have more of them, where do you think they're gonna enforce them?
*  They're not they're not going to to Malibu to enforce gun laws
*  They're enforcing them in South Central
*  Like I mean that's just is what it is
*  So people don't think about the actual real consequences of these laws they look at them and say oh, well, it's not that that bad
*  It's pretty reasonable. No, okay. What about the other 10 11 12 other laws on top of that that were considered just reasonable
*  I think so many people are just buying the party narrative
*  Whatever the party narrative is, you know, whether it's the party narrative is that we don't need guns guns should be eliminated
*  Any guns are bad
*  They don't have like this nuanced very detailed perspective on what what gun ownership actually is
*  The reason they don't is because of the way we have the conversation. Mm-hmm
*  Right now the conversation is the on their side or on their side and we throw shit at each other
*  but the problem also is
*  Who controls most of the mass media?
*  Liberal people exactly and the word in most people why your shadow band?
*  That's what it is. That is what it is much man. It's nuts man. I have like it's like I look at stuff
*  I'm like I look at I look at my numbers and then I look at it compared to people who are like in
*  I don't know like tech
*  They make tech videos and stuff like that and I'm like our numbers are on par but I guarantee all our videos and monetize
*  Well, it's shadow banning is real. Yeah, you know, it's real on Instagram. It's real on YouTube. It's real on Twitter
*  It's real and all those things. Yeah, and it's it's it's really not much that we can do
*  I mean what mean I know what I do. I just I pivot
*  Yeah, you know one thing is shut it's happened before like they'll just keep shutting and shutting doors on me
*  And I just try to pivot and figure it out
*  But now what I've done is that like which emphasizes the importance of having your own independent platform
*  It does it does and
*  We just hit three hours believe it. Oh shit. Really?
*  It's already 330 man, but I just want to say I think you're doing a great job
*  And I think you know out of all the people that are promoting guns and you do it in in my opinion the most
*  Reasonable and well thought out perspective. I appreciate you very much. Thanks, brother. Thanks for being. Thank you very much
*  Goodbye friends. Bye everybody
*  You
