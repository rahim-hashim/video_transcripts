# Joe Rogan Experience #2268 - Rick Caruso
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5.76s)]
*  Good to see you sir. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=9.96s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=14.4s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=15.4s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=16.4s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  It is a terrible time for Los Angeles and unfortunately you did not win. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I wanted you to win. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=23.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=24.96s)]
*  I was rooting for you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=25.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=26.96s)]
*  It's just the politics in LA are, it's almost like watching people who are in a cult who [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=27.96s)]
*  are being confronted by the cult experts who are telling them, hey, this is all crazy and [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=33.84s)]
*  fake and you're ruining your life and they're like, no, no, no, I think it's going to work [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=39.36s)]
*  out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=43.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=44.28s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of things that aren't working out. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=45.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, listen, I know like you being, spending time and living in LA, it's an amazing city. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=54.96s)]
*  When I ran for office, as much as I loved LA, I actually fell in love with it more because [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=56.6s)]
*  I got to see places that I wouldn't normally see. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=62.6s)]
*  And so it was really amazing and people and the diversity and the dearness of so many [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=65.48s)]
*  neighborhoods and people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=69.8s)]
*  But what's happened to LA over the last decade is just tragic and people are paying huge [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=72.44s)]
*  consequences for it and it's sad to watch. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=79.28s)]
*  So if you get to the heart of it, like if you did, if you won and you became the mayor [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=83.82s)]
*  of LA, what could you do to try to turn this battleship around? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=89.61999999999999s)]
*  Because it's a big battleship. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=93.74s)]
*  It's a big battleship and people will argue that the mayor of LA doesn't have a lot of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=95.58s)]
*  authority, like other mayors. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=99.13999999999999s)]
*  You know, I learned a lot, Joe. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=102.61999999999999s)]
*  I worked for three mayors. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=104.17999999999999s)]
*  I worked for Tom Bradley when I was in my mid-twenties as a commissioner. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  I was the head of department of water and power. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=110.02s)]
*  I worked for Dick Reardon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=112.7s)]
*  He brought me back in to head of DWP during the energy crisis. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=113.82s)]
*  The department was under a lot of financial strain. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  And then I worked for Jim Hunt, who brought me in to turn around to LAPD and I was the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  police commissioner, the head of the police commission. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=125.78s)]
*  So I've seen really good leadership. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=128.5s)]
*  And honestly, what we've had in the last two mayors is not good leadership and we're paying [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  a price for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=136.24s)]
*  So you may not have a lot of power, but actually I think the most powerful thing you can have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=137.9s)]
*  that I learned as a police commissioner, if you're not worried about getting reelected [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=143.34s)]
*  or reappointed, it's really amazing what can happen because you can make decisions that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=148.38s)]
*  are actually in the best interest of the people. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  And I believe that career politicians are always worried about getting reelected. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=158.12s)]
*  They are scared to death of getting a real job. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  They've never had to sign the front of a check, only the back. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=166.86s)]
*  So it's very difficult for them to even think about being out of office. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=170.26000000000002s)]
*  So they just circulate. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=173.62s)]
*  You know, they go from the city council to the state assembly to the state senate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=174.62s)]
*  And we end up with the same sort of look and feel of leadership, which is pretty weak. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=179.46s)]
*  I think Dick Reardon was a good example of a guy who came in and did a lot of great stuff. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=186.62s)]
*  I actually think Jimmy Hine did a lot of great stuff as mayor. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=191.06s)]
*  So I would go in there with some strong leadership. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=195.06s)]
*  I would certainly go in there and reach across the aisle and find common ground and all of [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=197.18s)]
*  those things you need to do to move forward. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=201.94s)]
*  But I would certainly plant some really strong goals that everybody knew we were working [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  towards. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=210.74s)]
*  Because, you know, I believe that either lead, follow, or get out of the way. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=211.74s)]
*  And I really admire people who lead. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=217.1s)]
*  I wouldn't mind being a little bit controversial if it's in the interest of doing what's in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=221.26s)]
*  the best interest of the residents. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=225.18s)]
*  Well that's what I enjoyed about your campaign. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=227.1s)]
*  And that's what I was really hopeful about, is that it seemed like you were not running [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=230.18s)]
*  for mayor because you wanted to be the mayor. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=235.22s)]
*  You were running for mayor because you're a businessman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=237.14s)]
*  And you realized that this was not being run like a successful business. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=239.82s)]
*  You knew how to run a successful business. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=243.22s)]
*  You knew the difference. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=244.82s)]
*  And LA is just constantly plagued by this crony political movement. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  The same people, same type of people, shuffling in and out. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=254.61999999999998s)]
*  And it just nothing ever changes. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=258.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=260.09999999999997s)]
*  And again, to give you a little bit of background, I am so indebted to LA. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=261.09999999999997s)]
*  It sounds a little bit corny, but, you know, my paternal and maternal grandparents, they [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=266.82s)]
*  were both immigrants. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=272.58s)]
*  My grandfather, paternal grandfather, was a gardener in Los Angeles. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=273.9s)]
*  He lived in Boyle Heights. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=277.14s)]
*  He started as a coal miner. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=278.34s)]
*  He actually probably had one of the worst jobs you could ever have in life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  When he immigrated here to a little town called Uniontown, Pennsylvania, he was the dynamiter. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=284.14s)]
*  He was the guy that had to go in the lead. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=289.78s)]
*  Oh boy. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=291.74s)]
*  Yeah, set the dynamite and get the hell out in time. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=292.74s)]
*  And his brother, who immigrated with him, said, come to LA. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=295.86s)]
*  It's sunny. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=300.18s)]
*  My dad was actually born in a coal mining camp outside the coal mine. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=301.42s)]
*  But anyway, he was a gardener out here. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=307.1s)]
*  We actually grew up in his truck as he would go around. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=308.94s)]
*  And they had this small little home they rented in Boyle Heights. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=313.18s)]
*  And I think about what LA gave to my grandparents, to my dad, to me, my family, the opportunity [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=318.02s)]
*  to build a business. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=326.0s)]
*  And so running for mayor, the motivation was, I want to give back to the city that gave [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=328.02s)]
*  me so much. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=333.46s)]
*  And by the way, all the problems that we've got, you can fix them with a little bit of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=334.74s)]
*  backbone, a little bit of smarts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=339.78s)]
*  If you're equipped right, bring together some really smart people. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  You could fix everything. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=344.82s)]
*  And to your point, what happened when I was tied at the end of the race and actually a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=347.14s)]
*  little bit ahead? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=353.14s)]
*  Biden flies into campaign. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=355.62s)]
*  Kamala flies into campaign. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=358.34s)]
*  Pelosi, Bernie. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=360.9s)]
*  And at the end of the day, when we're 10 days before election day, they finally convinced [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=363.53999999999996s)]
*  Obama to do a message. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=369.14s)]
*  And so the system is so it's a closed looped. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=373.29999999999995s)]
*  And the idea that somebody was going to come in the tent that's an outsider was horrifying [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=376.9s)]
*  to them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=384.34s)]
*  We would laugh about it as a family. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  You might as well just load up Air Force One all at one time and bring everybody out. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  But I loved every minute of it. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=393.58s)]
*  And I hope at some point that system is changing. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=397.17999999999995s)]
*  And I think people are getting more frustrated lately. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=400.7s)]
*  And they're looking for people who are competent rather than just people who may share ideology. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=405.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=411.02s)]
*  And by now, 80% of people have probably abandoned their New Year's resolutions. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=412.9s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=417.14s)]
*  Life can get crazy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=418.14s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you don't have the time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=419.14s)]
*  But one easy habit to stick with is AG1. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=421.26s)]
*  It's an easy, realistic habit that you can make to benefit your whole body health. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=424.65999999999997s)]
*  AG1 makes hard to get micronutrients easy to get and replaces multiple vitamins and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=429.14s)]
*  supplements with just one scoop. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=434.5s)]

*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=481.18s)]
*  In the difference between 2020 and 2024, how many different counties went red that were [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=482.18s)]
*  blue historically? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=487.22s)]
*  So let's break down the problems with LA and what could be done to fix it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=489.98s)]
*  What do you see as like the primary issues of LA right now? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=495.1s)]
*  Well, you know, you got a homeless problem that continues to grow. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=499.86s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=504.58s)]
*  OK, 70,000 people in LA County. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=505.58s)]
*  One of the things we've covered on that is it's at least 70,000. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=507.58s)]
*  I mean, if they have a real accurate count. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=510.34s)]
*  But the real question is why? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=512.86s)]
*  And why is so much money spent on it and no results? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=515.9s)]
*  We've covered it on this podcast that there's people that are bureaucrats that work for [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=520.58s)]
*  this department of homelessness and they're making a quarter million dollars a year and [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=524.9000000000001s)]
*  they have no incentive whatsoever to make anything better because it doesn't hurt them. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=530.7s)]
*  They're not paid based on whether or not they clean up the homeless issue. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=534.38s)]
*  They're just paid. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=537.7s)]
*  So the longer the homeless issue goes on, the more they keep their job. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=538.7s)]
*  It's a profitable job. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=543.34s)]
*  And they just rant on and on about we need housing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=545.2600000000001s)]
*  That's not the problem. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=548.86s)]
*  You know, I had a plan and I'm confident my plan would have worked. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=550.6999999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about housing for a minute. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=556.42s)]
*  L.A. and L.A. County, they put in a tax called HHH to build 10,000 units. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=558.4599999999999s)]
*  At least about a year ago, I think they had maybe short of a thousand units built. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=567.38s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=573.14s)]
*  Over 10 years. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=574.14s)]
*  Over 10 years. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=575.14s)]
*  I'm amazed they built one. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=576.14s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=577.14s)]
*  But you know what they built them for? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=578.14s)]
*  $300,000 a unit. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=580.18s)]
*  That was the cost of it. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=582.18s)]
*  If you go to the sector, the nonprofit sector that's actually doing amazing work with the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=584.18s)]
*  homeless like down on Skid Row, Ground Zero, they're building on average $300,000 a unit. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=590.02s)]
*  But what happens in the city, in the government, there's so many layers of waste on top of [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=597.62s)]
*  waste on top of waste. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=602.66s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=604.34s)]
*  So yeah, you're right. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=605.34s)]
*  Very little is happening. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=606.84s)]
*  No housing is being built by the government, even though they have massive taxes. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=607.98s)]
*  We got another tax called ULA. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=611.9000000000001s)]
*  When you sell your home, you have to pay another 5% over $5 million. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=614.58s)]
*  So there's taxes on top of taxes. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=618.58s)]
*  There is a solution to the homeless. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=621.82s)]
*  So let's give, I'll just give you an example. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=623.3800000000001s)]
*  There's a company called Boxable outside of Vegas, and they're building units that are [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=625.86s)]
*  500, 600 square feet. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=630.5s)]
*  On average, they're about 60,000, 70,000 a unit. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=634.5400000000001s)]
*  This young guy figured out how to build up basically a production line to knock these [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=637.86s)]
*  things out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=642.54s)]
*  And when I was campaigning, I said to him, when I win, I'm going to give you a contract [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=643.54s)]
*  for 30,000 units. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=648.38s)]
*  And there's so much open space, Joe, in and around Los Angeles that's controlled by the [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=650.5s)]
*  city. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=654.74s)]
*  And we're going to start getting people in homes, getting them taken care of, giving [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=655.98s)]
*  them the service they need. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=659.58s)]
*  But the other thing we need to do, you can't have open drug dealing on the streets. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=661.58s)]
*  We welcome it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=665.66s)]
*  And if you look around MacArthur Park, the great old Langer's Deli, and the poor owner [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=667.3s)]
*  Norm Langer's, who basically said after 70 years, I got to close my restaurant. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=672.58s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=677.18s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=678.18s)]
*  Amazing old place. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=679.18s)]
*  And then Mayor Bass promised, I'm going to be down there. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=680.18s)]
*  I'm going to clean it up. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=682.34s)]
*  We're going to fix it. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=683.34s)]
*  It hasn't changed in six months since she said that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=684.34s)]
*  It can be cleaned up. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=687.3s)]
*  It can be fixed. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=688.86s)]
*  You got to have some backbone. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=690.18s)]
*  It's a lot of it is a mental health issue, correct? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=691.9s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=694.98s)]
*  And drug addiction. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=696.7s)]
*  Drug addiction, a lot of that comes from mental health issues as well, right? [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=697.7s)]
*  So what could be done? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=701.74s)]
*  You're dealing with an enormous population of people that have this issue. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=703.98s)]
*  It's probably closer to 100,000 in L.A. County. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=706.98s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=709.94s)]
*  That's the high estimates, right? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=710.94s)]
*  So let's say 70,000 to 100,000 people. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=713.14s)]
*  You have a lot of people. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=715.26s)]
*  What could be done to have some sort of a large program that gets real results with [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=716.94s)]
*  helping these people with their mental health issues and helping these people with their [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  drug addiction issues? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=728.2199999999999s)]
*  I think you start first by enforcing the law and don't allow the sale of drugs on the street [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=730.18s)]
*  and holding the drug dealers accountable. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  Not just the sale, but the open use. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=736.8199999999999s)]
*  I mean, meth, cooking meth right out in front of everybody. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=738.3s)]
*  All the above. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=742.06s)]
*  I mean, literally in downtown, there's tents that are run by the drug dealers where everybody [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=743.06s)]
*  knows to go to get their drugs. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=750.1s)]
*  So you got to start there. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=751.38s)]
*  But I'm a big believer that government alone can't solve major problems, right? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=753.6600000000001s)]
*  And you've got organizations downtown that are really doing great stuff. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=759.14s)]
*  Downtown Women's Center is doing great stuff. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=764.4200000000001s)]
*  Union Rescue Mission, great stuff. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=766.7800000000001s)]
*  And they're bringing people in. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=768.62s)]
*  They're giving them the help and the treatment they need for drug addiction and mental health [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=770.22s)]
*  care. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=773.86s)]
*  And they're giving them housing. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=774.86s)]
*  Scale those people up. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=777.62s)]
*  Take the dollars we're spending and wasting on the city trying to do it and start pushing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=779.06s)]
*  dollars to organizations that have a proven track record of success. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=783.6199999999999s)]
*  And their success, Joe, is like a 90% success rate. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=787.54s)]
*  And scale it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=791.66s)]
*  Why go reinvent a model that's already working well? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=792.7399999999999s)]
*  And there's probably a dozen organizations downtown that are doing a good job. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=795.8199999999999s)]
*  And what are they doing? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=800.6999999999999s)]
*  And you do it at a fraction of the cost. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=801.6999999999999s)]
*  I already interrupted you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=802.6999999999999s)]
*  Do it at a fraction of the cost. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=803.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, these people that are being successful, how are they doing it? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=804.6999999999999s)]
*  What's their method? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=807.2199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like I'm not the expert in it. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=808.66s)]
*  But when I went down there and spent time during the campaign and since then, because [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=812.14s)]
*  we've been supportive of their efforts as a family, they actually welcome people as [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=815.62s)]
*  they are. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=819.86s)]
*  No judgment. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=820.86s)]
*  Downtown Women's Center. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=822.18s)]
*  Tonight in Los Angeles, there'll be about 20,000 women that will go to sleep on the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=823.66s)]
*  street and the majority of those women will in some form or fashion be abused, sexually [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  abused. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=835.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=836.14s)]
*  It's terrible that we allow this. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=837.14s)]
*  It's a crime we allow this. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=838.62s)]
*  But an example of Downtown Women's Center, they accept them the way they are, mental [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=840.3s)]

*  I don't think you need to build new big institutions. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=872.82s)]
*  What I do think you need to do is cut all the red tape, start building quickly, funding [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=876.6600000000001s)]
*  these organizations and fund them quickly. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=882.14s)]

*  It's in Skid Row. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=894.86s)]
*  It's not like you're building in a sensitive environmental area. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=896.3399999999999s)]
*  Give the damn permits and say go. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=901.6s)]
*  I first encountered Skid Row when we used to film Fear Factor Downtown. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=903.76s)]
*  I'd heard of it. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=908.52s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=909.52s)]
*  We had done a bunch of the Fear Factor stunts in abandoned buildings. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=911.88s)]
*  It makes good backdrops, creepy. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=915.48s)]
*  I went there one time. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=920.8s)]
*  I took a wrong turn. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=921.8s)]
*  I went right into the meat of everything. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=924.3s)]
*  I was like, this is insanity. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=927.04s)]
*  This was 2004, 2003. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=928.84s)]
*  This is 20 years ago, 22 years ago. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=932.24s)]
*  Even back then, it was bananas. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=936.64s)]
*  Come see it now. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=938.24s)]
*  I've heard. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=940.36s)]
*  We watched that documentary. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=941.36s)]
*  Is it the Carlisle Hotel, Jamie? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=942.36s)]
*  One of the documentaries on one of the old downtown hotels. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=945.88s)]
*  It went into the history of Skid Row. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=950.96s)]
*  What Skid Row was, they would take people, they would arrest them for being vagrants [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=953.28s)]
*  somewhere else, and they'd bring them to Skid Row and just leave them there and basically [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=957.28s)]
*  box them in and leave them in this area. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=960.16s)]
*  They had soup kitchens and places where they could get food. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=962.68s)]
*  They were allowed to just sleep on the street, so they just stayed there. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=967.32s)]
*  They essentially, instead of fixing this problem of homeless people and mentally ill people, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=970.24s)]
*  they just pushed them into this one area and they said, we got a spot. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=974.88s)]
*  We could just stick them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=979.1600000000001s)]
*  We could turn our back on it. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=980.1600000000001s)]
*  Of course, every business in that area got devastated. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=981.6800000000001s)]
*  All those hotels, glorious old classic hotels. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=984.5600000000001s)]
*  In fact, the Morrison Hotel just caught fire because vagrants were living in it, and it's [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=988.84s)]
*  gone now. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=992.96s)]
*  These methods that these people are using that are successful, what are they? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=996.2s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1000.7800000000001s)]
*  What they're doing is they're giving them the treatment they need. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1002.78s)]
*  Union Rescue Mission is a different approach. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1005.22s)]
*  Union Rescue Mission, that's a faith-based organization, hugely successful, it's overflowing. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1007.86s)]
*  They can't accommodate everybody. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1014.1s)]
*  They need a lot more funding, but they don't allow anybody to use drugs or alcohol the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1016.22s)]
*  minute they check in and they get an apartment. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1021.14s)]
*  The other organizations that I'm aware of allow them to continue that, but they're required [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1024.82s)]
*  to go on programs to get off the drugs, to get the mental health care that they need. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1029.94s)]
*  They have skilled workers. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1035.3400000000001s)]
*  They're literally daily classes, there's protocols, there's requirements of the residents on what [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1037.06s)]
*  they can do and what they can't do. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1042.8600000000001s)]
*  To give them structure. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1044.3400000000001s)]
*  They give them structure, that's right. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1045.5s)]
*  That's a great word. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1048.0800000000002s)]
*  They give them structure, they give them training, they give them hope, and they give them a [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1049.0800000000002s)]
*  path forward. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1051.5800000000002s)]
*  I've always said this, let's assume your number's right. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1053.9s)]
*  There's 100,000 homeless on the streets in LA County, whatever the number is. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1057.2s)]
*  People say you can't solve the whole problem. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1061.94s)]
*  Why don't we start with solving half of it? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1065.68s)]
*  That'd be nice. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1068.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1070.72s)]
*  Let's solve for the group of people that for whatever reason are down and out, lost their [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1072.04s)]
*  job, lost their apartment. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1079.44s)]
*  You've got more families on the streets now, Joe, than ever before. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1083.24s)]
*  Let's start with that group and let's help them very quickly. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1087.86s)]
*  Give them training, give them a job, give them a path forward. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1091.76s)]
*  Then you sort of work through the system, but we're not even doing that. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1095.76s)]
*  Now you've had the fires, the estimate is there's another 180,000 people in LA that [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1102.0s)]
*  are homeless. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1107.8s)]
*  Is that insane to think about? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1109.6s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1111.2s)]
*  The 180,000 though, a lot of them, it's just because they're trying to find a place, but [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1112.36s)]
*  they're not destitute. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  A lot of these people are people that had some money. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1118.6799999999998s)]
*  Who knows what's going to happen with insurance? [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1123.9599999999998s)]
*  See, that's the problem. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  Unfortunately, the fire insurance issue in Los Angeles is kind of insane. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1125.9599999999998s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1129.24s)]
*  We were talking in the lobby before I was evacuated three times when I lived in LA. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1132.04s)]
*  Two of my neighbors lost their homes. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1138.52s)]
*  Those folks cry in front of the rubble of where they lived. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1141.8s)]
*  It's just horrible. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1148.6000000000001s)]
*  But they kept their lives and this was 2018 and they rebuilt some of them. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1150.8s)]
*  Two of the houses are still gone in my old neighborhood. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1157.04s)]
*  They never rebuilt. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1160.48s)]
*  Sorry to hear about that. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1161.48s)]
*  They just pulled out. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1162.48s)]
*  They're just like, what am I going to do? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1163.48s)]
*  They lose everything. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  Mel Gibson lost books from the 1600s. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1166.1200000000001s)]
*  Mel is a very religious man. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1170.4s)]
*  He collects these ancient, irreplaceable books. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1172.24s)]
*  And then, of course, the loss of lives is horrifying. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1177.3600000000001s)]
*  That issue is an issue that has plagued LA and California forever. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1181.72s)]
*  So a big point of contention during the election and even during the first Trump administration [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1188.44s)]
*  was the use of water and that water was being funneled into the Pacific Ocean and now, apparently, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1194.0400000000002s)]
*  you could tell me more. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  You probably know more than I do. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  What has been done about that water? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1203.12s)]
*  Because it seems like Trump has changed that. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1205.52s)]
*  Well I think what Trump did a good job of, first of all, I'm grateful for the fact that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1207.84s)]
*  he flew out, had a meeting, and I'm grateful. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1212.48s)]
*  I have my differences at time to time on some issues with him, but he sat down and he was [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1217.08s)]
*  forceful in a very strong way of holding the elected officials accountable, like get the [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1223.56s)]
*  people back in their homes now. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1229.04s)]
*  So the fact that in this tragedy we've got a president who's also a builder who understands [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1232.32s)]
*  what needs to be done I think is great. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1238.08s)]
*  And I hope he continues to hold all the elected officials accountable. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1241.24s)]
*  He can make a big difference. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1245.96s)]
*  And we need it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1247.24s)]
*  On the water issue, listen, I headed up Department of Water and Power, like I said, for 10 years. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1248.96s)]
*  I have a pretty good understanding of the water issues. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1253.68s)]
*  What's happening in the north really has not as much of an impact as happening down in [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1257.28s)]
*  Southern California in terms of how the water gets transferred around. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1263.88s)]
*  It doesn't mean we should be pouring water into the ocean. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1267.32s)]
*  We should not be. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1269.44s)]
*  We should be doing a lot of things. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1270.72s)]
*  We should be collecting water. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1272.04s)]
*  We should be holding water. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1273.44s)]
*  We should be recycling water. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1274.66s)]
*  We should be doing a lot of things. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1276.56s)]
*  What happened in Los Angeles, which is just close to negligence, if not negligence, Joe, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1278.08s)]
*  the fire hydrants ran out. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1287.36s)]
*  We evacuated our home and we're in Brentwood. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1289.96s)]
*  So you know the area. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1295.96s)]
*  We're 15 minutes from the palisades where the fire started. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1297.52s)]
*  And it was my birthday. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1301.48s)]
*  We were having family dinner. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1303.52s)]
*  On the second floor, we saw the flames. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1306.76s)]
*  We said we're going to have to get out of here. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1309.64s)]
*  The power went off. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1311.68s)]
*  We said we're out. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1312.76s)]
*  We gathered the family. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1313.76s)]
*  We moved down to a home we have in Newport Beach. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1315.24s)]
*  And I get a call from one of my senior executives who sort of embedded in with the fire command [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1319.68s)]
*  post. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1325.32s)]
*  And my heart dropped. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1326.32s)]
*  He said, we just lost your daughter's home. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1328.08s)]
*  And I said, oh my God, Bannon, how the hell did that happen? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1331.28s)]
*  You know. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1334.16s)]
*  He said, you can't believe it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1336.16s)]
*  The hoses ran dry and the whole neighborhood went up. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  And I was so angry that I, Fox 11, the local Fox station was on with Alex Michelson, and [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1343.92s)]
*  I texted him because they were reporting live. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1354.48s)]
*  This is about 1030 at night. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1357.5600000000002s)]
*  I said, are you getting reports that they've run out of water? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1359.72s)]
*  He said, not at all. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1363.2s)]
*  And I said, you need to report this. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1365.52s)]
*  He said, do you want to come on live? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1367.24s)]
*  I said, yeah, hook me up. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1368.52s)]
*  And I went on. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1370.68s)]
*  He couldn't believe it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1371.68s)]
*  And some of the media was trying to spin it. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1372.96s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1374.88s)]
*  Like it's not true. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1375.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1376.88s)]
*  And then they went right to the firemen. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1377.88s)]
*  It went right to the firemen, right? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1378.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1380.92s)]
*  The firemen said, yeah, we're standing there, empty hoses. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1381.92s)]
*  How in God's name, the second largest city in the country, can you have a water system [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1384.88s)]
*  that runs out of water in a fire? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1390.08s)]
*  And you knew the fire. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1392.48s)]
*  You knew this was coming, right? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1393.48s)]
*  They gave warnings of catastrophic winds. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1395.68s)]
*  The reservoir is empty over, I think it was 1.7 million gallons. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1399.64s)]
*  I think it's 11 million. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1404.48s)]
*  Maybe 11 million. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1406.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1407.28s)]
*  Probably right. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1408.28s)]
*  It's empty during fire season. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1409.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1411.88s)]
*  You've got brush that hasn't been cleared for 40 years. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1412.88s)]
*  There was a whole bunch of us raising hell about that after the fire in Brentwood six [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1416.24s)]
*  years ago. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1421.3600000000001s)]
*  Nothing was done. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1423.24s)]
*  The fire department wasn't pre-deployed, so there weren't engines staffed in different [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1424.3999999999999s)]
*  areas. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1429.12s)]
*  You've got a fire department that's underfunded, and you've got fire equipment that's mothballed. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1430.8799999999999s)]
*  And then the mayor flies to Ghana. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1436.56s)]
*  And the mayor is out of town. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1437.56s)]
*  So what should have been done, and who's responsible? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1439.56s)]
*  Well, I think the leadership is responsible at every level. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  I think the mayor is responsible for not being better prepared. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1447.0s)]
*  I think she's certainly responsible for not staying in town. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1450.36s)]
*  It's a lack of judgment. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1454.0s)]
*  If you want to be a leader, the first thing you have to do is be present. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1455.0s)]
*  I don't know what all the meetings that she had beforehand to make sure everybody was [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1460.28s)]
*  prepared, but years ago, the brush should have been cleared. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1467.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1468.6s)]
*  And you probably couldn't have prevented the fire. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1469.6s)]
*  Maybe you couldn't have prevented the fire. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1471.4599999999998s)]
*  Only God knows. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1473.12s)]
*  Well, we don't really know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1474.12s)]
*  But you could have mitigated it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1475.12s)]
*  We don't really know the source of the fire yet. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1476.12s)]
*  And we do know there was quite a bit of arson. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1477.8999999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1480.28s)]
*  That's true. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1481.28s)]
*  And there was a fire, to your point, there was a fire on New Year's Eve from fireworks. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1482.28s)]
*  And there's some talk that it may have been in that same area that this sparked up again, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1488.72s)]
*  or maybe it was another arson that went up there. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1493.8s)]
*  But it seems like there were several fires that started very close to each other. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1495.92s)]
*  It seems like highly unlikely. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1500.92s)]
*  Could be. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1504.0s)]
*  That there was just three accidents that took place at the same time as these catastrophic [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1505.0s)]
*  winds. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1508.96s)]
*  The most sinister version of it is that somebody wanted this to happen. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1510.8400000000001s)]
*  Maybe some mentally ill person. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1513.72s)]
*  I know they did arrest... [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1514.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a sickness. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1515.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1516.8400000000001s)]
*  It is a sickness. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1517.8400000000001s)]
*  Arsonists are, they're really sick people. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1518.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's a known psychological illness. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1520.88s)]
*  There's a guy that they arrested that was a known arsonist, several times arrested, who [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1524.44s)]
*  had a fake fire truck and drove down. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1531.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1533.64s)]
*  Drove down from Oregon to do who knows what. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1534.64s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1536.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1537.76s)]
*  Well, there's... [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1538.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's some real sick people out there. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1540.56s)]
*  There's some weird people also that enjoy watching other people lose everything. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1541.96s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1547.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1548.28s)]
*  But I guess people who feel like they have nothing and they feel like the world has screwed [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1549.28s)]
*  them over and they haven't got the breaks they deserve, they literally want to watch. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1552.68s)]
*  And there's this entitled culture that we live in that kind of tells people that the [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  reason why other people are successful is because they've stolen from you. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1560.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1563.24s)]
*  Which is just the craziest thing to say in America. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1564.24s)]
*  But it gives them an excuse. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1567.04s)]
*  It gives them an excuse. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1568.6s)]
*  And it also gives them a pathway to vent their anger and instead point it productively at [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1570.4399999999998s)]
*  their own lives. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1575.08s)]
*  It's like, why am I in this position right now? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1576.08s)]
*  What could I have done differently? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1577.4399999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1578.4399999999998s)]
*  What personal responsibility do I have for the way I live right now? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1579.4399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1581.56s)]
*  Instead of that, it's like, no, no, no, these rich people, they fucked you over. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1582.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1585.04s)]
*  They took advantage of us. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1586.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1587.04s)]
*  So the water, what is the explanation for why that enormous reservoir that provides [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1588.04s)]
*  the palisades with water was empty? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1595.08s)]
*  Well, the explanation that's been said is it's out of service because the cover on it [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1597.96s)]
*  needed to be repaired. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1601.48s)]
*  Oh, the cover. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1602.48s)]
*  The cover. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1603.48s)]
*  Because, you know, we're very sensitive in LA that bad things don't get in our water. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1604.48s)]
*  So they have to keep all these reservoirs covered, which in general I get. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1609.22s)]
*  I get the safety of that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1613.6399999999999s)]
*  But how about this? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1615.6s)]
*  You know that you have catastrophic winds coming. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1618.24s)]
*  Start pumping water in it because nobody gives a shit about what's in the water. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1621.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1624.68s)]
*  When you need it in your fire hydrant. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1625.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1627.0800000000002s)]
*  That could have been done in probably a couple of weeks. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1628.0800000000002s)]
*  Whatever it took. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1630.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1631.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's not like we don't know. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1632.0800000000002s)]
*  LA has fire season. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1633.0800000000002s)]
*  I remember every year because when I used to live in Bell Canyon is, you know, it's [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1635.6000000000001s)]
*  about 35 minutes from LA. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1640.0800000000002s)]
*  And it gets rough out there. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1642.44s)]
*  It's like a lot of like big rolling hills and it gets all filled with grass. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1644.0s)]
*  And if it catches and the winds start whipping through those canyons, the winds in California [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1648.72s)]
*  for people that don't know, every year we get the Santa Ana winds. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1653.48s)]
*  And they're crazy. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1657.52s)]
*  They are crazy. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1658.52s)]
*  Some of them were 100 miles an hour this year. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1659.52s)]
*  That is just, if you ever been out there for that, that's nuts. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1661.52s)]
*  And if there's fires blowing, boy. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1664.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it's a terrible combination. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1666.76s)]
*  I mean the early settlers called them the devil winds. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1669.8s)]
*  They've been there forever. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1673.1599999999999s)]
*  Forever. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1674.1599999999999s)]
*  To your point. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1675.1599999999999s)]
*  They've been there forever. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1676.1599999999999s)]
*  So just think about, you know, had the brush been cleared, had the reservoirs been full, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1677.1599999999999s)]
*  had the fire trucks been stationed, had there been a whole series of protocols in place, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1682.56s)]
*  again. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1688.28s)]
*  We could have saved some houses. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1689.28s)]
*  It could have saved a lot of lives, a lot of houses, a lot of jobs, a lot of pain. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1690.6s)]
*  A lot of pain. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1695.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1696.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1697.72s)]
*  So that's just incompetence. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1698.72s)]
*  There's no way you could say, oh, I see why they didn't do that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1699.8s)]
*  Oh, I see why they didn't have the resources. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1703.2s)]
*  Oh, it's not their fault. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1705.3600000000001s)]
*  No, there's none of that there. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1706.3600000000001s)]
*  No one's saying that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1707.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1708.56s)]
*  Everyone is saying it's a failure. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1709.56s)]
*  It's a failure because they're not equipped to deal with the leadership they needed. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1711.2s)]
*  Even the spin masters, even the greatest of gas lighters have nothing. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1714.8000000000002s)]
*  There's not one person who's tried to pass the buck. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1720.0400000000002s)]
*  I've not seen one successful person go on the air and say everything was done that could [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1723.1200000000001s)]
*  have been done. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1728.76s)]
*  We have amazing leadership. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1729.76s)]
*  We're really proud of them. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1731.0800000000002s)]
*  We're really lucky we have them. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1732.48s)]
*  Not one. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1734.1200000000001s)]
*  You're right. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1735.1200000000001s)]
*  Not one. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1736.6000000000001s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1737.68s)]
*  It is kind of crazy. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1738.94s)]
*  They gaslight everything, no matter what it is. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1739.94s)]
*  Everything's safe and effective. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1742.14s)]
*  Everybody's fine. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1743.46s)]
*  Everything's great. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1744.46s)]
*  He's the sharpest attack. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1745.46s)]
*  They gaslight the shit out of you with everything. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1747.46s)]
*  But with this one, they're like, there's nothing you could say. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1750.22s)]
*  I agree with it because the facts are the facts. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1754.38s)]
*  The facts are the facts. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1756.26s)]
*  You just can't argue around the facts. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1757.26s)]
*  And also there's a thing that happens when an area bigger than Manhattan that's filled [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1758.7s)]
*  with the most liberal people. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1762.26s)]
*  They're the most liberal. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1765.02s)]
*  The most blue, no matter who. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1766.1s)]
*  The most compassionate, kind people that view being a Democrat and being a liberal as being [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1767.82s)]
*  the ultimate expression of being a good person. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1779.54s)]
*  And they're getting slapped in the face by the reality. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1782.9s)]
*  I think the politics have changed. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1785.02s)]
*  It's a big weekend. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1787.32s)]
*  Get in on the action of the big game and UFC 312 at DraftKings Sportsbook, the official [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1788.92s)]
*  sports betting partner of the UFC. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1795.04s)]
*  The men's middleweight and women's strawweight titles will be on the line in the co-main [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1797.76s)]
*  events of UFC 312. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1802.3999999999999s)]
*  And of course, pro football is crowning a champion at the big game. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1805.08s)]
*  Just getting started, pick a fighter or a team to win this weekend. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1809.36s)]
*  Go to DraftKings app and make your pick. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1812.76s)]
*  That's all there is to it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1815.36s)]
*  And if you're new to DraftKings, listen up. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1817.6s)]
*  New customers can bet $5 to get $200 in bonus bets instantly. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1819.96s)]
*  Download the DraftKings Sportsbook app now and use the code ROGON. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1825.96s)]
*  That's code ROGON for new customers to get $200 in bonus bets when you bet just five [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1829.28s)]
*  bucks. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1834.8s)]
*  It's a big weekend only on DraftKings. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1835.8s)]
*  The crown is yours. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1838.24s)]
*  I think the reality has set in, honestly, and it's unfortunate it's taken this, but [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1849.96s)]
*  has set in that you've got to have competent leadership. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1877.72s)]
*  And what happened at DWP, because I was there for 13 years, 10 of which I was president, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  close to 10, is the head of that department got politicized. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1887.28s)]
*  Years ago under Bradley and under Reardon, under Hahn, the general manager of Department [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1894.24s)]
*  of Water and Power was always somebody who came through the ranks, who was just this [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1899.64s)]
*  exceptional engineer. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1906.0400000000002s)]
*  And that department was regarded as best in class in the country as a utility bar none. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1907.48s)]
*  The best financial rating, the best engineers wanted to work there. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1913.24s)]
*  It built some of the most amazing projects in history, including Hoover Dam. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1917.68s)]
*  So let's just start with that one, right? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1921.64s)]
*  Then what happened, politics creeped into who was the general manager. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1925.08s)]
*  That destroys an organization. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1931.3999999999999s)]
*  This is an organization that's not in the business of being necessarily doing what's [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1933.1799999999998s)]
*  politically important at the time. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1939.76s)]
*  It's in the business of delivering water and power. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1943.28s)]
*  And the failure is also there. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1947.84s)]
*  I don't understand how the current general manager of the department, I don't know what [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1950.52s)]
*  she did and didn't do, but the kind of failure that's on her desk where the buck stops, she [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1955.56s)]
*  needs to resign. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1963.44s)]
*  She needs to be fired, in my opinion, by the mayor, and be held accountable for whoever [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1965.02s)]
*  made bad decisions, including herself. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1971.48s)]
*  But we're allowing this. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1974.44s)]
*  And so the minute you allow that, that continues this creep of incompetence is tolerated. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1976.4s)]
*  And it shouldn't be tolerated because people lost their lives. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1984.02s)]
*  They lost their homes. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1987.6200000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1988.6200000000001s)]
*  Am I right about that? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1989.6200000000001s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1991.2s)]
*  And I think you're 100% right about politics. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1992.64s)]
*  And the problem with politics is that people want to preserve the structure that pays them. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=1996.6200000000001s)]
*  the entity that they're invested in, that they have their time in, they have all their [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2002.56s)]
*  connections. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2007.12s)]
*  And this is the weird world of politics versus the world of business. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2008.8s)]
*  And what's fascinating right now is we're getting a chance to see what happens when [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2014.44s)]
*  you take a business approach to the government in the White House. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2018.58s)]
*  We're seeing right now with this whole USAID thing, where they're uncovering massive amounts [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2022.96s)]
*  of corruption and waste and just a lot of weird shady shit with NGOs and where an enormous [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2027.74s)]
*  amount of money is going. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2035.02s)]
*  And you're seeing someone look at this thing that is incredibly efficient almost by design. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2037.5800000000002s)]
*  And instead of saying, like, well, this is just how it is. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2045.5s)]
*  And this is how these politicians get funded. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2049.26s)]
*  So let's just keep this thing going the same way it is and make some incremental changes [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2051.14s)]
*  to try to make people happy so we still get elected. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2054.62s)]
*  Instead of that, you're seeing a politician, a president, who's coming in who can't get [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2057.32s)]
*  reelected. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2061.7200000000003s)]
*  So he's just going ham. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2062.9s)]
*  And he's just cleaning out everything. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2064.94s)]
*  And people are freaking out. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2066.88s)]
*  The same people that say we need radical change. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2068.26s)]
*  We need radical change. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2070.76s)]
*  We've got corruption. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2071.88s)]
*  We need radical change. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2072.88s)]
*  Okay, well, here's your radical change. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2073.88s)]
*  We don't need this. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2075.1600000000003s)]
*  But you do. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  The government does. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2077.76s)]
*  They need oversight. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2078.86s)]
*  And they haven't had that. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2079.86s)]
*  And because of that, you're seeing this not just waste. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2081.76s)]
*  You could call it waste, but it's deeper. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2085.58s)]
*  It's deeper than waste. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2087.74s)]
*  It's corruption. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2088.74s)]
*  And you're seeing that corruption get weeded out. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2089.74s)]
*  I am hoping that this is successful and that it yields a benefit to the American people, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2092.94s)]
*  to the working class people, to everybody, where they recognize, like, hey, we can't [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2099.2s)]
*  just be spending all our fucking tax money on nonsense. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2103.72s)]
*  And it all should be done with a real clear understanding of getting results. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2107.94s)]
*  If that happens and that idea spreads across the country, because ideas spread and people [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2114.58s)]
*  change their minds. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2120.98s)]
*  And sometimes it happens, one guy in the neighborhood will go, you know what, fuck this. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2122.94s)]
*  I'm fed up. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2125.98s)]
*  And then everybody will be like, yeah, I've been kind of thinking that too. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2126.98s)]
*  I just didn't want to say it. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2129.02s)]
*  And then people start talking. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2130.5s)]
*  And then it's not a scary thing to discuss anymore. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2132.22s)]
*  It opens the door 100%. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2135.1s)]
*  And you're seeing that now. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2136.86s)]
*  I feel it in LA. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2138.42s)]
*  You're seeing that now. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2140.46s)]
*  It's terrible that it took this kind of tragedy to have people saying it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2141.7s)]
*  I'm a big believer it can change. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2145.46s)]
*  I'm a big believer that LA can turn around. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2146.94s)]
*  I'm a big believer we can fix the problems. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2149.26s)]
*  I'm a big believer we can fix the problems in California. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2150.98s)]
*  I really am. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2154.54s)]
*  And I think we have started to turn this corner where people are saying, you know what, whether [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2156.3s)]
*  you're Democrat or Republican to me sort of doesn't matter. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  Are you competent? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2165.2200000000003s)]
*  Do you have experience? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  Are you going to make decisions for the right reason? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2168.66s)]
*  When I was a president of the police commission, it was the most amazing experience because [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2172.7799999999997s)]
*  Jim Hahn's mayor, we have a police department that was failing miserably after the Rodney [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2178.1s)]
*  King riots. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2185.5s)]
*  The police department was under a federal consent decree. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2187.7s)]
*  A federal judge was overseeing it. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2191.5s)]
*  We had Bernie Parks, who was the chief of police. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2193.98s)]
*  I don't know if you remember Bernie Parks. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2196.62s)]
*  He was probably there when you were living there. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2198.14s)]
*  He came out of central casting. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2201.14s)]
*  Very handsome, proud black man and wore the uniform beautifully, rose through the ranks. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2203.7s)]
*  Super nice guy. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2210.3399999999997s)]
*  We were friends. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2211.3399999999997s)]
*  Jim Hahn calls me and says, hey, I want to appoint you as the president of the police [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2213.18s)]
*  commission. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2217.2999999999997s)]
*  And I said, Mr. Mayor, I really appreciate it, but I don't want the job because I knew [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2218.66s)]
*  what the job was going to entail. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2222.62s)]
*  I was really having to fire a very, very popular chief of police. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2224.62s)]
*  And he's two or three times called back. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2228.9s)]
*  I finally did it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2231.2999999999997s)]
*  So glad I did because I learned so much from the experience. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2233.38s)]
*  At the end of the day, decided we needed to move on and have a different chief of police. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2236.02s)]
*  What was wrong? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2244.06s)]
*  What was he doing? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2245.06s)]
*  What he was doing, Joe, is he had put in procedures, discipline procedures that were so onerous [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2246.2999999999997s)]
*  on the officers that one officers were leaving. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2255.2599999999998s)]
*  But more importantly, the bad guys, particularly the gangs, were very smart that they would [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2260.62s)]
*  start filing complaints in certain areas that they wanted to control around the city. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2267.58s)]
*  And so the officers started getting all these complaints on their record. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2274.14s)]
*  And once they did, it held up any kind of promotion or transfer. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2278.62s)]
*  So what did the cops started doing? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2283.1s)]
*  They started saying, I'm just not going to go to that area. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2284.46s)]
*  And the minute they abandoned that area, the gangs controlled it and crime was going crazy. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2287.06s)]
*  How clever. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2292.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2293.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2294.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2295.62s)]
*  So I would go to the chief and say, come on, you got to change the discipline process. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2296.62s)]
*  Nope. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2299.2999999999997s)]
*  Not changing a thing. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  Very stubborn guy. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2301.2999999999997s)]
*  He had all the answers. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2302.5s)]
*  But yeah, I don't mean that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2303.5s)]
*  It's facetious. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2306.6200000000003s)]
*  He didn't have all the answers, obviously. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2309.38s)]
*  So that was a main problem. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2311.82s)]
*  So if you had an area of the city that bordered L.A. County, L.A. city crime was rising. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2312.82s)]
*  L.A. County was going down because the sheriffs are actually proactively and not in an abusive [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2318.46s)]
*  way proactively policing. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2324.7400000000002s)]
*  LAPD was retreating. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2326.26s)]
*  Cops were upset. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2328.34s)]
*  Cops were leaving. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2329.34s)]
*  The academy is empty. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2330.34s)]
*  And things were happening. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2331.38s)]
*  I had to change leadership. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2332.38s)]
*  I had people burning me in effigy. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2335.94s)]
*  Literally. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2339.7000000000003s)]
*  My wife would call me and say, oh, my God, they're burning you outside a city hall. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2340.7400000000002s)]
*  They're marching. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2344.7400000000002s)]
*  It was crazy to put pressure on me to keep Bernie Parks. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2345.7400000000002s)]
*  Not because Bernie Parks was the best chief of police, because it was politically correct [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2351.1800000000003s)]
*  to do that. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2355.7400000000002s)]
*  And I remember calling Jimmy Hahn, the mayor, and I said, I'm going to make a recommendation [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2358.7s)]
*  and you're probably not going to like it because you're going to come under a lot of heat. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2362.58s)]
*  And to his credit, he said, just do what's right. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2367.94s)]
*  I'll take the heat. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2370.18s)]
*  And I recommended we hire Bill Bratton. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2371.94s)]
*  And we brought this guy in to L.A., his Boston accent and all, best cop in the country, built [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2375.02s)]
*  a team around him. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2385.22s)]
*  We got crime down to levels not seen since 1950, doing all the right things, engaging [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2388.62s)]
*  the community, senior lead officers, walking the beat, getting to know the neighborhoods, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2395.58s)]
*  started hiring. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2401.3399999999997s)]
*  People wanted to be a member of LAPD. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2402.3399999999997s)]
*  There was now back a pride in it. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2404.06s)]
*  Completely turned it around within a couple of years. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2406.98s)]
*  But that all came and then Jimmy lost reelection because the black community unfortunately [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2410.1s)]
*  abandoned him because of not keeping Bernie Parks. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2416.9s)]
*  It's one of the reasons. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2422.86s)]
*  But he did the right thing. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2425.14s)]
*  He didn't care about his political future. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2426.74s)]
*  He cared about the city. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2428.62s)]
*  He never gets enough credit for this. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2429.8199999999997s)]
*  And I just learned that lesson, which I talked about earlier. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2432.3399999999997s)]
*  If you've got the freedom to make a decision without worrying about getting reelected, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2435.46s)]
*  it's probably where the president's head is. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2440.26s)]
*  I'm just going to do what I think is right. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2442.42s)]
*  It really is amazing what can happen. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2445.86s)]
*  So let's get more people like that who just understand, let's do what's right for people. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2448.34s)]
*  I'm in public service. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2455.58s)]
*  Serve the damn people. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2457.3s)]
*  It almost seems like at this point, you need someone who's outside of politics to run for [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2459.0s)]
*  office. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2465.06s)]
*  I think you do. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2466.06s)]
*  Because everybody. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2467.06s)]
*  I know that sounds self-serving, but I think you do. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2468.06s)]
*  Of course, it would sound self-serving coming from someone who wants to be outside of it [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2469.58s)]
*  and want to be the mayor. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2474.02s)]
*  But I think that's the correct response because the people that are in it are just too tied [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2475.5s)]
*  in. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2481.86s)]
*  They're too tied in. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2482.86s)]
*  They're too beholding. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2483.86s)]
*  They're too beholding. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2485.3s)]
*  It's entwined. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2487.34s)]
*  The octopus has many tentacles. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2488.34s)]
*  It's wrapped around everything. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2490.38s)]
*  And it just stalls all progress and change. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2491.9s)]
*  No real radical change can ever be met. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2494.78s)]
*  No one wants to go with it because it's going to disrupt all their different ideas and businesses. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2498.54s)]
*  And people are going to look like they're responsible or incompetent. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2502.98s)]
*  So they don't want change. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2507.38s)]
*  They want to pretend that this is the only way to go forward. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2508.38s)]
*  And then if someone does come along and changes things radically, it makes them all look terrible. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2511.3s)]
*  And it's dangerous. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2516.1s)]
*  It's dangerous for business. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2517.1s)]
*  They're not in the business of helping people. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2519.1s)]
*  They're in the business of keeping their job. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2521.02s)]
*  100%. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2522.86s)]
*  And that's what's gross. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2524.2200000000003s)]
*  It is really gross. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2525.2200000000003s)]
*  It is gross. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2526.2200000000003s)]
*  And it seems like the only way that that ever gets resolved is you have to bring in someone [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2527.2200000000003s)]
*  who's a businessman or a businesswoman, someone who understands business, who's outside of [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2532.38s)]
*  this political system and says, I've studied this for years. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2536.9s)]
*  There's a lot of things that could be fixed. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2541.1s)]
*  And they're not being done and we could do it. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2542.94s)]
*  And you know the issue with that is it's such a tough system. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2545.34s)]
*  There's so much that gets thrown at you. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2550.1s)]
*  Yeah, like the whole entire party of Democrats came to go after you. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2552.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2557.1800000000003s)]
*  I was a Democrat. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2558.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm very moderate. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2559.94s)]
*  You know, I'm fiscally very conservative. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2561.82s)]
*  I'm socially liberal. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2564.06s)]
*  But they were so you know, what gives the incentive to the person on the outside to [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2566.34s)]
*  do it? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2571.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2572.94s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2573.94s)]
*  And that's what we've got to figure out. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2574.94s)]
*  Listen, I've got high hopes for San Francisco with their new mayor. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2575.94s)]
*  Again, an outsider came in and won. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2579.94s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2582.9s)]
*  I hope he does great. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2583.9s)]
*  I hope he does too. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2584.9s)]
*  He changes the city. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2585.9s)]
*  That place was amazing at one point, Tom. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2586.9s)]
*  I used to love going to San Francisco. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2587.9s)]
*  I haven't gone in years. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2589.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm right with you. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2590.6200000000003s)]
*  It's too crazy. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2591.6200000000003s)]
*  No, it's terrible. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2592.6200000000003s)]
*  It's a dump. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2593.6200000000003s)]
*  It's unbelievable that one of the greatest cities in the country has just completely [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2594.6200000000003s)]
*  fallen to...but no course correction until now. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2599.3s)]
*  I'm hopeful for this new mayor as well. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2603.46s)]
*  And I'm also hopeful that a lot of the new young tech people are fed up. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2605.46s)]
*  I think the new people who grew up with the internet understand the corruption and the [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2610.42s)]
*  bullshit whereas the old people from a couple decades ago were really just spoon-fed bullshit [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2614.38s)]
*  from the mainstream media. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2620.34s)]
*  And they thought that this is the only way to be. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2622.0200000000004s)]
*  We're the kind, intelligent, well-read progressive people on the West Coast. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2624.7000000000003s)]
*  It's our responsibility to be compassionate and to be the most charitable people possible. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2628.98s)]
*  You're not doing anybody a service by letting them camp out in front of your house and smoke [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2635.86s)]
*  meth. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2639.2999999999997s)]
*  None of that's good. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2640.2999999999997s)]
*  It's all real bad for them. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2642.06s)]
*  It's all real bad for your kids. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2643.2599999999998s)]
*  And all those businesses moved out. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2645.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes, all those businesses moved out. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2647.14s)]
*  San Francisco just became insane watching all these enormous chains just pull out. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2648.54s)]
*  And then people get angry and cry racism when they pull out. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2653.9s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2658.14s)]
*  It's just from the outside. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2662.18s)]
*  Moving to Texas was such an eye-opener too. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2663.18s)]
*  I'm jealous. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2666.46s)]
*  Being here in Austin today, all the new buildings going up. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2668.7799999999997s)]
*  I said to my wife, oh my God, look at this. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2672.8599999999997s)]
*  It's booming. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2674.98s)]
*  It's booming. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2675.98s)]
*  Freedom. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2676.98s)]
*  I go to a restaurant last night and people are happy having a great time and there's [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2677.98s)]
*  new buildings going up and high rises and the city's clean. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2681.98s)]
*  Everywhere I drove around last night today, just immaculate. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2685.98s)]
*  I talked to Stephen Adler, who was the former mayor of Austin, great guy. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2689.86s)]
*  He was explaining to me the homeless situation. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2694.14s)]
*  We had a long talk about it because it really boomed during COVID. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2696.06s)]
*  He was saying, look, LA's too big. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2699.3s)]
*  I think I can fix the problem in Austin. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2702.62s)]
*  They did an enormous job. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2704.94s)]
*  How did they do it? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2706.6600000000003s)]
*  They did a fantastic job. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2707.6600000000003s)]
*  They bought a bunch of hotels. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2708.6600000000003s)]
*  They put people up. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2710.46s)]
*  They started programs. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2711.46s)]
*  They put a lot of effort into it. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2712.78s)]
*  But they were only dealing with a few thousand homeless people. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2714.2200000000003s)]
*  They had like three thousand. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2717.22s)]
*  This is what Stephen Adler was saying. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2719.98s)]
*  He was saying, you could fix that. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2721.98s)]
*  You can't fix it when it gets to 80,000, 90,000. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2724.18s)]
*  He's like, it just gets too big with the bureaucratic process. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2728.58s)]
*  As government functions today without the outsider coming in and making radical change. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2733.3399999999997s)]
*  The way it functions today, he's like, it's just too big. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2738.14s)]
*  He goes, I think I can fix Austin. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2742.5s)]
*  I think I can fix Austin before I get out. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2744.54s)]
*  I think he did a great job. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2746.54s)]
*  That's good. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2747.74s)]
*  There's still problems. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2748.74s)]
*  You're always going to have problems. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2749.74s)]
*  You have cities. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2750.74s)]
*  You're going to have mentally ill people. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2751.74s)]
*  You're going to have drug addicts. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2752.74s)]
*  You're going to have people that have just been abused their whole life and they're just [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2753.74s)]
*  destroyed mentally. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2757.06s)]
*  And then they're out. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2758.54s)]
*  And then you have schizophrenia and all these other. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2759.54s)]
*  It's very sad. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2761.14s)]
*  It's very sad. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2762.14s)]
*  We clearly need better mental health institutions set up in this country to deal with a lot [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2763.62s)]
*  of these people because that's what a lot of it. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2769.86s)]
*  And a lot of it happened during the Reagan administration when they changed the... [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2771.58s)]
*  It closed them down. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2775.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2777.1000000000004s)]
*  They closed down mental health institutes and just said, you're on your own and just [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2778.1000000000004s)]
*  let these people loose on the street. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2780.54s)]
*  And then on top of that, you have the crack epidemic that comes around at the same time. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2781.82s)]
*  It's like chaos, just full chaos. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2785.5800000000004s)]
*  And you saw, like I saw the changes in the cities. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2788.1400000000003s)]
*  I saw the changes in the news. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2794.1800000000003s)]
*  I saw, you know, and people were recognizing that this is like a new problem. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2795.78s)]
*  But it's never been like Los Angeles where you're driving down the street. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2801.1400000000003s)]
*  You just see blocks and blocks of tents. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2806.42s)]
*  What's just like, how is this not fixed? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2809.9s)]
*  You're not even allowed to litter. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2812.86s)]
*  So if you're not allowed to litter, how are you allowed to do that? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2814.78s)]
*  There's definitely a couple of standards that are different. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2817.98s)]
*  I'm not giving up that it can be fixed, though. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2820.58s)]
*  And I understand there's a big difference with solving for 3,000 versus 80,000, whatever [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2822.6600000000003s)]
*  the number is. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2826.94s)]
*  But it can be fixed because it has to be fixed. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2828.6600000000003s)]
*  I think it has to be fixed by an outsider is what Stephen Adler's point was ultimately [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2830.7000000000003s)]
*  is like, you know, being in the system. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2835.3399999999997s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2837.74s)]
*  There's no doubt it has to. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2838.74s)]
*  And again, somebody that's willing to risk their political career by doing the right [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2840.42s)]
*  thing for the people on the street. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2844.58s)]
*  These are human beings that have a right to be given a chance to have a better life. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2846.14s)]
*  And a lot of people are there, you know, just because everything went wrong in their life. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2853.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2859.46s)]
*  And God bless them. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2860.46s)]
*  And you got to try to fix it. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2861.46s)]
*  And the waste of the money in doing it is a crime. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2863.9s)]
*  Anyway, we've talked about it, but I'm I'm still hopeful. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2865.86s)]
*  I know I run overly optimistic in life, but I think it can be done. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2868.3s)]
*  What's worked out well for you? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2872.62s)]
*  Well, I've been pretty fortunate and blessed in my life. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2873.62s)]
*  No complaints. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2876.78s)]
*  Working hard and being overly optimistic actually works out sometimes. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2878.34s)]
*  A lot of times. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2881.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2882.7s)]
*  OK, so so let's talk about law and order. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2883.7s)]
*  That's a giant issue in Los Angeles. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2887.86s)]
*  People do not feel as safe as they used to feel. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2890.4199999999996s)]
*  They feel like there's more violent crime, it's more unreported crime. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2894.62s)]
*  And maybe more concerning is that people get arrested and then immediately get released. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2898.3399999999997s)]
*  And there doesn't seem to be any repercussions for that. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2903.7s)]
*  So what would you do to change that? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2906.62s)]
*  Well, thank goodness state law got changed. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2909.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's another really good example of what happened in California, that they [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2911.66s)]
*  repealed the law that allowed anything under nine hundred dollars to just be a misdemeanor. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2914.8599999999997s)]
*  It was insanity. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2919.98s)]
*  Insanity. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2920.98s)]
*  Just insanity. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2921.98s)]
*  And they weren't bundled. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2922.98s)]
*  So you could like in a Syrian fashion keep stealing nine hundred dollars. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2923.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2928.9s)]
*  Every day. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2929.9s)]
*  Every hour. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2930.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2931.9s)]
*  Yeah, as long as it's out of pop. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2932.9s)]
*  It was still a misdemeanor. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2933.9s)]
*  So that law changed. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2934.9s)]
*  Great progress. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2936.58s)]
*  Holding bad people accountable is really important. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2939.46s)]
*  I'm also a big believer to give people a chance to rebuild their lives. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2943.46s)]
*  No doubt goes hand in hand. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2948.38s)]
*  But we made a big change by getting rid of George Gascon as a district attorney who was [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2951.26s)]
*  not prosecuting and allowing people. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2956.3s)]
*  It was just a turnstile. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2958.7400000000002s)]
*  You got arrested. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2959.94s)]
*  You were let out. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2960.94s)]
*  What? [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2961.94s)]
*  Can we get to the heart of that? [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2962.94s)]
*  Sure. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2964.6200000000003s)]
*  What's the motivation for that? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2965.6200000000003s)]
*  Motivation for doing that? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2967.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2968.58s)]
*  That. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2969.58s)]
*  Well, I probably won't explain it right because I don't I don't agree with it. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2970.58s)]
*  Is that from a social justice standpoint, quote unquote, you don't want to overpopulate [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2976.1s)]
*  the prisons. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2982.38s)]
*  You don't want to hold people and take away their life for a minor crime. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2983.38s)]
*  But a lot of it wasn't minor crimes. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2987.9s)]
*  A lot of it was a minor crime. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2990.18s)]
*  There was one of them that was a guy who was this crazy homeless guy who pulled a knife [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2991.18s)]
*  on a sheriff. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2995.02s)]
*  And then two weeks later, there at least somewhere a little short time after that, I don't know [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=2996.54s)]
*  if it's two weeks, attacked a man with his family with a machete on the beach. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3001.66s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3005.7799999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3006.98s)]
*  You're right. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3007.98s)]
*  I mean, that's a violent criminal. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3008.98s)]
*  What George did. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3009.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3010.98s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3011.98s)]
*  And I can't explain it because it's just it's so messed up. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3013.5s)]
*  I don't even know how you justify letting somebody out of jail or not holding them with [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3016.8599999999997s)]
*  bail. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3022.2999999999997s)]
*  Any of that. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3023.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3024.3399999999997s)]
*  I think most people got to the point they were so worried about where crime was going. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3025.3399999999997s)]
*  They did finally get rid of George. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3029.2599999999998s)]
*  And we brought in Nathan Hockman. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3031.64s)]
*  And I think Nathan's doing a great job. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3033.08s)]
*  So I can't I can't explain it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3036.08s)]
*  But the fear is that it's done on purpose. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  This is the fear. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3041.46s)]
*  Oh, of course it is. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3042.46s)]
*  That's the fear. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3043.46s)]
*  The great fear is that there are people in this world that want L.A. and major cities [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3044.46s)]
*  in this country to be in complete disarray, to have constant chaos and to be able to push [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3051.2799999999997s)]
*  liberal prosecutors and then push even more liberal prosecutors to go against them and [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3058.44s)]
*  continue this cycle and make it so that people live in a constant state of fear. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3063.12s)]
*  And what's the end goal of that? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3067.52s)]
*  It has to be profit. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3069.04s)]
*  I mean, someone has to be profiting off of it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3070.04s)]
*  Profits off of that. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3072.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3073.04s)]
*  Ask George Soros. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3074.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3075.04s)]
*  I asked the people that fund these like extremely liberal district attorneys that all seem to [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3076.04s)]
*  have the same idea. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3080.12s)]
*  But do you think that no cash bail? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3081.96s)]
*  I do. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3084.04s)]
*  I do think that time is turning. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3085.04s)]
*  And I know that Elon Musk wants to do sort of the exact opposite, like to try to find [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3086.06s)]
*  that he's been talking about that financing people that are much more reasonable and that [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3090.98s)]
*  believe in law and order. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3095.74s)]
*  Well, Nathan is a good example of that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3097.18s)]
*  That's great. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3099.06s)]
*  We need fair laws. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3100.06s)]
*  We need we need kind justice. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3101.06s)]
*  We need we do need rehabilitation. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3102.46s)]
*  But we also need to protect people that aren't criminals. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3104.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3106.5s)]
*  That's the primary thing is protect the general public. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3107.5s)]
*  Serve and protect. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3110.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3111.1s)]
*  That's the whole idea. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3112.1s)]
*  And then the people that were life did them wrong and they've wound up like, let's figure [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3113.16s)]
*  out a way to actually rehabilitate them instead of just putting them in cages. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3117.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3122.08s)]
*  And people are doing that. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3123.08s)]
*  I mean, there's some very successful programs that are doing that. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3124.08s)]
*  But I agree with you. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3127.12s)]
*  I mean, we got to get back to the point where governments primary function is to protect [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3128.12s)]
*  the public and give them the ability to prosper. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3134.04s)]
*  Give them the ability to build a business, raise your family, keep your community safe. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3137.68s)]
*  It's just so basic. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3141.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so basic. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3143.42s)]
*  It's gone upside down. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3144.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3145.42s)]
*  That's what's crazy is that law and order thrown out the window without law and order. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3146.42s)]
*  No one is safe. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3149.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3150.3s)]
*  You need to understand that if you just don't go after bad people, then they have no fear [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3151.3s)]
*  of doing whatever they want. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3156.46s)]
*  And then you're letting them out on jail. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3157.7000000000003s)]
*  So out of jail. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3159.5s)]
*  So then you've got more of them out than ever before. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3160.6200000000003s)]
*  So perpetuate. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3162.98s)]
*  There was a podcast that I listened to where there was a former gang member who was talking [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3163.98s)]
*  about how they're going to let 70,000 hard criminals out of the L.A. jails. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3167.5800000000004s)]
*  And he's like, I'm getting out of town. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3172.36s)]
*  This guy was a hardcore gang member. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3174.7200000000003s)]
*  He's like, L.A. is going to get too crazy in the next year. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3176.4s)]
*  It's just nuts. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3180.6400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, there was the whole defund the police movement, which was just catastrophic. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3181.6400000000003s)]
*  That whole and seeing politicians, including Kamala Harris, seeing politicians openly say [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3186.44s)]
*  and posted on Twitter, we need to defund the police, which is just crazy. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3192.28s)]
*  It is as wrong as it can be. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3198.56s)]
*  Yeah, certainly hold bad cops accountable, certainly have better training, certainly [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3201.14s)]
*  have higher standards. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3205.74s)]
*  But defunding the police, like, what are you talking about? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3207.2599999999998s)]
*  You need to do the opposite. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3209.54s)]
*  That's right. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3210.54s)]
*  You need to train them better, refund them. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3211.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3213.42s)]
*  Definitely make the bad ones accountable. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3214.42s)]
*  Definitely make people feel safe that they're interacting with police officers. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3216.62s)]
*  But respect these people. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3219.62s)]
*  Respect these people that are protecting your life. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3221.96s)]
*  That's right. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3224.58s)]
*  Because all those people, when something goes down, they call 911. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3225.58s)]
*  They're furious when cops don't show up. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3228.14s)]
*  That's right. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3229.98s)]
*  They don't talk shit about the cops that are protected. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3230.98s)]
*  Defund the police. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3233.44s)]
*  You're protected by armed security people. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3234.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3236.88s)]
*  And you're saying defund the police. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3237.88s)]
*  This is fucking nonsense. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3239.04s)]
*  It's nonsense. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3240.6s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3241.6s)]
*  And for people that suffered because of this defund the police thing and this whole wave [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3242.68s)]
*  of crime that went through L.A., you know, in the wake of it all, you know, those people [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3247.2400000000002s)]
*  are the people that you can get to. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3252.52s)]
*  The people that saw it, experienced it, know the consequences of this foolish direction [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3256.34s)]
*  that everything is going in, those are the people that you can still reach. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3261.92s)]
*  And I think it could be reached with a person like you that is a compassionate, kind, liberal [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3264.5s)]
*  guy when it comes to social issues, but understands business and understands like accountability [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3270.82s)]
*  and that you have to see positive results. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3276.96s)]
*  You have to do what needs to be done to get those positive results. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3279.76s)]
*  You can't just do the same shit over and over again and pay more people. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3283.36s)]
*  And we need a bigger budget. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3287.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, like, oh, let's raise the... [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3288.98s)]
*  We've increased the budget to fix the problem. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3290.86s)]
*  You're not fixing it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3293.26s)]
*  It keeps getting bigger. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3294.26s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3295.26s)]
*  It's just nuts. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3296.26s)]
*  You got it. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3297.26s)]
*  It needs someone outside the system. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3298.26s)]
*  And that's why I was really happy to talk to you. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3299.78s)]
*  And that's why I'm really happy that you're still involved. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3301.52s)]
*  Because a lot of people like yourself that are very wealthy and you don't have to do [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3304.1800000000003s)]
*  this, this is not going to be... [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3308.1s)]
*  You're not going to make money doing this. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3309.1s)]
*  This is probably going to be a huge strain, a tremendous amount of pressure. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3311.4s)]
*  But some people feel a calling and they feel like, I think I can do something and fix this [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3316.6s)]
*  that other people maybe won't be able to do. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3321.56s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3323.6s)]
*  And I do. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3324.9s)]
*  I do because what's the alternative? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3325.9s)]
*  We stay on the same path. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3328.52s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3329.8399999999997s)]
*  The alternative is it gets worse. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3330.8399999999997s)]
*  It's going to get worse. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3332.0s)]
*  And more and more people are leaving. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3333.0s)]
*  More and more businesses closed down. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3334.92s)]
*  But here's what really hit me on the campaign. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3336.96s)]
*  I was telling our family, I've got four kids and they're 35 to 25 and just incredible people. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3338.84s)]
*  My wife is wonderful. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3347.3s)]
*  I'm really incredibly blessed with all of that. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3348.3s)]
*  I was so worried when I decided to run for mayor the impact on the family. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3350.7000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3354.34s)]
*  A little bit scary. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3355.34s)]
*  High profile. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3356.34s)]
*  All these kind of things. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3357.34s)]
*  It ended up being the greatest experience. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3358.98s)]
*  And we would go into neighborhoods, hardworking neighborhoods of people that just wanted the [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3360.7000000000003s)]
*  ability to work hard and live their life. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3368.2s)]
*  That would just want the ability to allow their daughter to be able to walk to school [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3371.8799999999997s)]
*  on her own and not have to walk around an encampment or for fear that there would be [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  somebody that would attack her on the way to school. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3380.52s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3382.8399999999997s)]
*  The most basic things. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3383.8399999999997s)]
*  And we'd give them a hug. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3386.72s)]
*  They would cry. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3388.8799999999997s)]
*  We would cry. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3389.8799999999997s)]
*  And I would tell the kids that cry is hope. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3390.8799999999997s)]
*  And what we're seeing there is for the first time there's actually somebody coming into [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3395.02s)]
*  their neighborhood, a neighborhood that historically doesn't vote in large chunks. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3399.86s)]
*  So the politicians forget about them. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3407.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3410.1s)]
*  Because they're not likely voters necessarily. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3411.1s)]
*  But we were trying to mobilize it. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3413.18s)]
*  And we were also trying to give a voice to people that don't have a voice. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3415.34s)]
*  How inspiring that was for me. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3420.58s)]
*  That's what fueled me. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3422.78s)]
*  You're right. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3424.3s)]
*  I don't want a career as a politician. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3425.3s)]
*  I want a career of being able to give back and help and take the group of people that [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3429.0800000000004s)]
*  have the least voice but are some of the hardest working people of our society and give them [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3435.8s)]
*  an opportunity to grow. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3442.2000000000003s)]
*  That was my grandfather as an immigrant, as a gardener. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3443.88s)]
*  But he had the opportunity to raise his family where he didn't have to worry about all this [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3449.36s)]
*  shit. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3454.28s)]
*  It's just changed so much. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3455.28s)]
*  So I believe we've got to get our elected officials. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3458.2000000000003s)]
*  If we take people who are the hardest working, the dearest people that have the most impact [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3462.02s)]
*  because of crime, because of homelessness, because of being overly taxed, all of these [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3470.1000000000004s)]
*  kind of things, and we give them hope and a path forward, everybody benefits from it. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3475.6800000000003s)]
*  You start solving so many problems, Joe. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3482.58s)]
*  There's a little school in the middle of the heart of the worst part of Los Angeles with [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3485.2599999999998s)]
*  the homelessness in Skid Row, and it's called Pada Los NiÃ±os. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3493.8199999999997s)]
*  And my wife and I have been supporting that school for over 30 years now. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3498.94s)]
*  Outside the doors is the biggest sea of inhumanity of homeless people just strewn out on the [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3504.14s)]
*  drugged out, all terrible mental health conditions. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3511.22s)]
*  You open that door and it's beautiful and caring and loving. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3515.34s)]
*  And this school that we support, there's a series of schools, takes in children from [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3520.9s)]
*  six months to five years old. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3525.8s)]
*  The parents are all working parents, below the poverty line working parents. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3528.92s)]
*  So they're working in the sweatshops, whatever the case may be. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3534.38s)]
*  They're living down on Skid Row in apartments, two or three families in an apartment, working [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3536.98s)]
*  their tail off to just survive. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3542.46s)]
*  And then to be able to get their child in this school that costs them nothing, it's [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3545.58s)]
*  fully supported. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3549.26s)]
*  Those are the dearest, sweetest children in the world. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3551.22s)]
*  We love going down there. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3553.08s)]
*  Our kids have worked down there since they were little kids. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3554.12s)]
*  We do a Christmas party for them. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3556.26s)]
*  And what gives us such joy is seeing the hope in their eyes. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3559.8s)]
*  And I know it sounds corny, but it's such an important path that we've got to get our [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3563.86s)]
*  elected officials to be more supportive of that and get more of these kind of schools [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3568.78s)]
*  and give more of these families the opportunity to do well because they want to do well. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3573.36s)]
*  But the system is frankly against them. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3578.3s)]
*  And that's what I wanted to change more than anything. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3581.78s)]
*  Well let's talk about that. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3584.7400000000002s)]
*  This school, there's no reason why they should have to encounter that environment outside [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3586.38s)]
*  that school. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3591.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3593.02s)]
*  There's no reason. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3594.02s)]
*  This is not nuclear waste. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3595.02s)]
*  This is not something that can't be cleaned up for five million years. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3596.02s)]
*  We have to leave it alone. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3598.9s)]
*  This is human beings. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3600.02s)]
*  This is human devastation out there in the street. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3601.02s)]
*  The fact that these kids have to encounter that, first of all, what does that do for [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3604.9s)]
*  your sense of hope and your future of the world? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  This is what you're seeing every day? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3612.42s)]
*  You absorb that from your environment. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3614.88s)]
*  The sadness and the devastation all around you. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3617.2200000000003s)]
*  Seeing people with lost lives out in the street right in front of your school. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3621.2599999999998s)]
*  When you're a young kid and you're developing mind and that's the environment that you encounter [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3624.74s)]
*  all the time, that is going to fuck your head up forever. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3629.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's very tough. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3632.06s)]
*  And then there's the question of the sweatshops. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3633.5s)]
*  How come people that work their tail off constantly have to live three, four families in an apartment? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3637.54s)]
*  What the hell is going on there? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3645.06s)]
*  I agree. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3647.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3649.78s)]
*  That's what I think we got to start fixing. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3651.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3653.42s)]
*  Right? [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3654.42s)]
*  And if you start fixing that now, your point is right. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3655.42s)]
*  These kids having to see that every day, they're being yelled at by people as they're walking [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3658.5s)]
*  through the doors and all that. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3663.1400000000003s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3664.1400000000003s)]
*  But thank God that school is there because if that school wasn't there. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3665.1400000000003s)]
*  They have nothing. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3668.1800000000003s)]
*  They got nothing. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3669.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3670.1800000000003s)]
*  They're on the street. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3671.1800000000003s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3672.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, the problem outside the school, that should be fixed. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3673.1800000000003s)]
*  That should be a public health issue. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3676.5800000000004s)]
*  I mean, if you're worried, the future human beings, if you want to look at this country [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3678.02s)]
*  and you want to make America a great place, what you want is less people that are going [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3686.1s)]
*  to lose at life. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3690.02s)]
*  You want less losers. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3691.02s)]
*  The best chance you can have less losers is start them off on a good path when they're [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3693.14s)]
*  young. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3699.9s)]
*  That's right. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3700.9s)]
*  Well said. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3701.9s)]
*  And if you're starting them off on a good path when they're young, if you're giving [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3702.9s)]
*  them the tools that they need to have a successful life, giving them hope, giving them examples [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3705.06s)]
*  of good people that you could strive to be like, what would Mike do? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3709.86s)]
*  I'll probably want to do what he does. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3713.5s)]
*  He would get up and get this done. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3715.14s)]
*  I admire that person. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3717.22s)]
*  Having people around you that are examples of someone who lives a life that you admire. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3719.2599999999998s)]
*  When you're just seeing people peeing on themselves and throwing up and walking through the streets [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  just covered in cardboard shelters and tents, that's not hope. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3731.7s)]
*  You're not going to see, you're not seeing good examples. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3736.2999999999997s)]
*  So what are you depending on for your examples? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3739.18s)]
*  That's a travesty. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3743.42s)]
*  That should be cleaned up immediately. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3744.5s)]
*  So let's talk about that. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3747.52s)]
*  What could be done for Skid Row, which is probably the worst example of LA's homeless [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3749.2599999999998s)]
*  problem? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3754.18s)]
*  It's the same thing with any place else that we talked about. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3755.8399999999997s)]
*  You have to, I believe, supercharge these organizations like Aparos and Ineos that are [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3758.82s)]
*  doing well, that are really changing lives. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3765.38s)]
*  Like the downtown women's center, like Common Concern, there's Union Rescue Mission, there's [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3768.5s)]
*  dozens of them. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3772.1400000000003s)]
*  Where do you put all those people? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3773.1400000000003s)]
*  You've got all these people on the streets. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3774.1400000000003s)]
*  You've got 100,000 people on the streets. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3775.82s)]
*  There's endless land. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3777.46s)]
*  There's endless land. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3779.0600000000004s)]
*  We, the city of Los Angeles has something like over 300 or 400 parcels of land that [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3780.0600000000004s)]
*  are vacant. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3785.5400000000004s)]
*  They're just sitting there vacant. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3787.02s)]
*  Densify them. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3789.7s)]
*  Build on them. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3791.22s)]
*  Build housing. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3792.46s)]
*  Absolutely do it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3794.66s)]
*  Skid Row, there's a lot of opportunity to do that and a lot of organizations that will [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3795.66s)]
*  do that. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3799.94s)]
*  But we can never say, well, create enterprise zones. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3801.02s)]
*  I mean, I wanted to create enterprise zones. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3804.58s)]
*  You go to South LA or whatnot. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3806.74s)]
*  There's areas that they were burned out years ago from the riots that have never been rebuilt. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3808.46s)]
*  Create an enterprise zone, give tax incentives to go down there and build housing. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3814.9s)]
*  The tax code, when I was a young lawyer, they changed all the tax laws, they had a lot of [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3819.9s)]
*  tax credits, a lot of incentives to do things. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3823.82s)]
*  It's a great way to incentivize businesses, mobilize the private financial markets to [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3827.1800000000003s)]
*  invest and do things. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3833.2200000000003s)]
*  There's an enormous amount of capital in this country. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3835.82s)]
*  We're the wealthiest country in the world. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3837.9s)]
*  Especially LA. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3839.46s)]
*  LA is so wealthy. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3840.46s)]
*  State of California, fifth largest economy in the world. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3842.42s)]
*  We have an economy larger than India. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3845.82s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3848.66s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3849.66s)]
*  And do we have problems? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3850.66s)]
*  Of course. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3851.94s)]
*  Can you imagine if we fixed the problems, what this state could do? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3853.3s)]
*  It would be incredible. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3858.1800000000003s)]
*  There's nothing like it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3860.1800000000003s)]
*  And so I think we just have to have some really basic goals of how we're going to change things [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3862.06s)]
*  little by little, start attacking them, but start getting people off the streets, start [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3870.74s)]
*  building, start giving the incentives to do it. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3875.9399999999996s)]
*  Break some eggs as you're doing it because you're saving lives. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3879.18s)]
*  And I think once you get that in motion, it starts taking off. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3882.3799999999997s)]
*  I really do. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3886.4199999999996s)]
*  Because people do not want to continue the way we're continuing. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3888.22s)]
*  And if there's a handful of people that do, who cares? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3893.2999999999997s)]
*  God bless them. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3896.8599999999997s)]
*  Leave them there. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3898.58s)]
*  But that's not the far majority of the people. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3899.7s)]
*  I think those handful of people are fed a narrative. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3901.7799999999997s)]
*  And the narrative is there's one way that's good and there's one way that's evil. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3904.62s)]
*  And there's the right-wing people that want to be fascist totalitarian dictators and they [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3909.06s)]
*  just want the wealthy to get wealthier and they want the poor to starve. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3914.14s)]
*  And then you have the left-wing side that has this idea of compassionate care and letting [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3917.6s)]
*  everybody be themselves and let people camp out. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3924.46s)]
*  And we need to treat people like human beings and they're not homeless. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3929.02s)]
*  They're the unhoused. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3932.54s)]
*  And you start reframing things. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3933.66s)]
*  And it's just a bunch of nonsense. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3935.5s)]
*  And unfortunately, these people are all conditioned to think that everybody opposed to them hates [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3937.58s)]
*  civil rights, hates women's rights, hates gay rights. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3944.18s)]
*  They're right-wing, hardcore, fascist assholes. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3947.14s)]
*  What we need is someone... [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3953.18s)]
*  This is one of the things that made me happy about you is that you need someone who appeals [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3954.98s)]
*  to people's sense of kindness and caring and being a progressive person in terms of social [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3959.02s)]
*  issues but yet understands human nature and understands business. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3966.78s)]
*  You have to do things if you want to change things. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3973.9s)]
*  You can't just throw money at it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3977.14s)]
*  You can't just have a bunch of people that are just bullshitting and not getting anything [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3979.1800000000003s)]
*  done. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3983.06s)]
*  This is the problem with LA that we see. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3984.1s)]
*  Well, there's no doubt. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3986.14s)]
*  But don't you think that is changing now, right? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3988.58s)]
*  We've talked about that. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3990.5s)]
*  I think it's changing. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3991.5s)]
*  I think it's changing. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3992.5s)]
*  But LA will snap right back to the old way. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3993.5s)]
*  I mean, if you just give them a couple of good years, they'll be convinced that... [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=3996.38s)]
*  We got to fight that good fight though, Joe. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4001.82s)]
*  We got to fight that good fight. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4003.62s)]
*  There's too much at risk. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4004.94s)]
*  There is too much at risk. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4005.94s)]
*  I do think it all really depends on how successful Trump is in this four years that he has and [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4008.1s)]
*  the structure that he sets up and how he can kind of... [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4015.3s)]
*  If it really shows people that, hey, guess what? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4018.62s)]
*  Gay people aren't losing rights. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4021.1s)]
*  Hey, guess what? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4022.42s)]
*  Women aren't losing rights. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4023.42s)]
*  Hey, guess what? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4024.42s)]
*  Civil rights aren't being eroded. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4025.42s)]
*  This is not what's happening. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4027.1s)]
*  And then the whole country benefits if we see GDP go up or we see homelessness go down. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4028.38s)]
*  That would be amazing. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4036.98s)]
*  If that happens, then maybe people could wake their mind up to the fact that you're not [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4037.98s)]
*  in this binary system and that you really shouldn't be a part of a team. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4042.82s)]
*  You should be a part of Team America. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4046.26s)]
*  And Team America is like, we want the whole thing to be better. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4048.1s)]
*  Everybody, all of us. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4051.02s)]
*  Wouldn't that be great? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4052.02s)]
*  It would be amazing. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4053.02s)]
*  It can be done. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4054.02s)]
*  And it can be done. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4055.02s)]
*  I agree. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4056.02s)]
*  It can be done. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4057.02s)]
*  Most people, I think, are reasonable, kind people. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4058.02s)]
*  Most people. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4060.02s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4061.02s)]
*  But I think people get trapped in ideologies. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4062.02s)]
*  California is one of the better examples of a place that's just trapped. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4064.38s)]
*  You're either a Democrat or you're a fucking asshole. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4068.02s)]
*  That's how people look at it. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4070.6200000000003s)]
*  You know? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4072.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4073.7400000000002s)]
*  That's how people look at it. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4074.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a lot of that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4075.7400000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4077.6600000000003s)]
*  I have a little bit more, again, I run a little bit more optimistic in the faith of my fellow [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4078.6600000000003s)]
*  Angelinos in Californians that I think there's a real desire to make significant change. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4085.82s)]
*  I really do. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4092.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot of that, even from some of my most liberal friends. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4093.66s)]
*  They want change. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4098.94s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4099.94s)]
*  Well, you can push people up to a point. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4100.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4103.82s)]
*  Now, I do think the success of Trump is going to have a big influence on that. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4104.82s)]
*  And so, especially in California, because the majority is very leery, right? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4110.46s)]
*  And Los Angeles, very leery of that. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4118.98s)]
*  And if he could do more of what he did that day at that press conference out on the Palisades, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4123.26s)]
*  it would be great because he did show a compassion. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4129.8s)]
*  He did show a strength. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4132.58s)]
*  He showed that what he cared about was the people getting back in their homes and let's [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4134.5s)]
*  take care of them. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4138.280000000001s)]
*  He showed an impatience with the bureaucracy that was, you know, they were spinning it, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4139.780000000001s)]
*  boy, the elected officials that day, and he was pushing back on it. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4146.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4149.9800000000005s)]
*  Professionally, very nicely, but very strongly. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4151.0599999999995s)]
*  He's much better at handling people this time around. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4154.219999999999s)]
*  I think he sort of corrected a lot of the way he used to communicate with people, and [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4156.66s)]
*  he's much more even and measured. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4161.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4163.9s)]
*  It's much more effective. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4164.9s)]
*  I agree. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4165.9s)]
*  I was impressed. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4166.9s)]
*  And like I said earlier, he's a builder. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4167.9s)]
*  He's a successful builder. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4170.259999999999s)]
*  And I would love to him to give a little blueprint to the city of LA and say, you know, here's [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4172.0199999999995s)]
*  the 10 things you need to do. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4178.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4180.62s)]
*  And it should only take that. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4181.62s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're doing. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4182.62s)]
*  This new foundation I launched with a bunch of really smart thought leaders in industry [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4183.62s)]
*  have come together. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4189.66s)]
*  We launched it yesterday just to go tackle problems. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4190.66s)]
*  Don't tell me what the problem is without the solution. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4194.22s)]
*  You know, I just live by that. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4196.82s)]
*  And there is a solution to every problem. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4198.58s)]
*  It may not be the solution you want, but there's a solution out there. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4200.58s)]
*  So work towards it. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4204.22s)]
*  And I'll give you an example. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4205.22s)]
*  You know, I've been pushing since the fires. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4207.06s)]
*  You've got to underground all the power lines. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4209.26s)]
*  You can't rebuild the palisades or Alta Dina the way it was built 70 years ago. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4211.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4216.34s)]
*  It'd be insane. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4217.34s)]
*  It's insane. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4218.34s)]
*  So underground the power lines, redo the water mains, redo the fire fighter system, blah, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4219.34s)]
*  blah, blah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4223.38s)]
*  And I get this pushback. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4224.38s)]
*  We don't have the money. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4225.68s)]
*  We don't have the time. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4227.04s)]
*  You just had the largest urban disaster in the history of the United States. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4229.0s)]
*  billion dollars worth of damage. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4235.62s)]
*  And you're telling me you don't have the money to do the right thing. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4238.18s)]
*  Didn't we just have the largest infrastructure bill in history passed about a year ago? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4242.62s)]
*  We must have the money and we'll find the money. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4248.5199999999995s)]
*  But that can't stop you from doing what's right. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4252.32s)]
*  So this organization I put together is to go be the advocate for those homeowners, to [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4254.94s)]
*  those business people that lost their businesses and work alongside government and say, listen, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4261.94s)]
*  we'll solve the problem for you and hand the blueprint to you. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4268.0199999999995s)]
*  So we're going to hold you accountable to implement it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4271.099999999999s)]
*  What is the answer when they say we don't have the money? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4273.259999999999s)]
*  If you have California, which is just insanely enormous economy, so and a very high tax rate, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4278.2s)]
*  one of the highest. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4284.5s)]
*  That's right. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4285.5s)]
*  So you have high taxes. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4286.5s)]
*  So you have an enormous economy. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4287.5s)]
*  That means you got a lot of money. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4288.5s)]
*  So where's the money going? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4290.219999999999s)]
*  Where the money is gone, I can't tell you. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4293.339999999999s)]
*  You know, we used to have a surplus in California. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4295.139999999999s)]
*  Now we have a deficit. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4297.0599999999995s)]
*  So if that happens at your home or my home, that means we mismanaged our money. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4298.86s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4303.419999999999s)]
*  In solving the problem for the Palisades or Altadena on the electric issues or the infrastructure [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4306.839999999999s)]
*  issues, listen, the city has bonding authority. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4312.5s)]
*  Department of Water and Power has bonding authority. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4315.78s)]
*  There's federal grants or state grants. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4318.48s)]
*  There's private capital. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4320.44s)]
*  We're going to go solve that and give some answers to the city. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4322.12s)]
*  But my point is the answer can't be let's not do what's right. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4326.879999999999s)]
*  We've done enough of that. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4332.08s)]
*  The answer has to be we're going to go do this and now we're going to solve how to pay [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4333.78s)]
*  for it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4337.78s)]
*  And we're going to do it quickly to get people back in their homes and start building again. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4338.78s)]
*  And I believe we can bend the curve. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4345.04s)]
*  If somebody thinks it's going to take five years, let's go figure out how we get it done [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4347.28s)]
*  in two years. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4351.24s)]
*  This is where private enterprise needs to come in and help the government because the [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4352.24s)]
*  government alone can't fix this problem. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4356.28s)]
*  It's too big. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4359.16s)]
*  They work too slow. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4360.5199999999995s)]
*  You need innovation and entrepreneurship that private enterprise brings. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4362.28s)]
*  We saw that in COVID with Project Warp Speed and getting the medicines that were needed [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4366.259999999999s)]
*  at the time. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4372.0199999999995s)]
*  on getting the rebuilding done. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4374.02s)]
*  And we need to implement the same thing in Los Angeles to get the city rebuilt because [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4376.26s)]
*  it's an impact on the American economy to have the size of two Manhattans. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4381.1s)]
*  Two Manhattans. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4386.660000000001s)]
*  That's how big it is. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4387.660000000001s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4388.660000000001s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4390.26s)]
*  14, 15,000 structures. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4391.26s)]
*  It's so hard for people to imagine that. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4394.46s)]
*  I just went back like I was telling you I was there a couple weeks ago for the UFC. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4397.14s)]
*  You see it and when you're flying over it just doesn't even make sense. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4401.82s)]
*  We showed the drone footage as well of the Palisades. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4407.0599999999995s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4410.139999999999s)]
*  It's so much devastation. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4411.139999999999s)]
*  You can't get your head around it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4412.139999999999s)]
*  Alta Dina is gone. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4413.139999999999s)]
*  Gone. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4414.139999999999s)]
*  Gone. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4415.139999999999s)]
*  And Alta Dina, my friend Jimmy Dorr was just talking about this the other day in a video, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4416.139999999999s)]
*  was this beautiful, nice neighborhood. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4420.78s)]
*  Tree lined streets. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4424.78s)]
*  Cottage homes. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4426.66s)]
*  Dear sweet neighborhood. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4428.54s)]
*  And gone. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4429.54s)]
*  Gone. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4430.54s)]
*  A beautiful neighborhood to drive through. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4432.42s)]
*  Gone. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4435.42s)]
*  And those people mostly, Joe as you know, so many of them there's no safety net. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4436.42s)]
*  Very moderate income. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4443.3s)]
*  Working class, hard working class people. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4445.62s)]
*  And I've been telling all the elected officials you've got to have programs that start supporting [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4449.62s)]
*  people because they are down and out. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4454.1s)]
*  They have nowhere to go. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4456.94s)]
*  We've got to do something to help them day to day to live. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4458.78s)]
*  One of the things that was bothering me was they were talking about replacing all those [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4464.139999999999s)]
*  beautiful streets that were filled with single family homes with big apartment buildings. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4468.82s)]
*  And then it would just ruin that area. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4474.66s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4477.54s)]
*  Can't do it. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4478.54s)]
*  It's wrong. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4479.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4480.54s)]
*  This is not the time to be reimagining anybody's neighborhood. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4481.54s)]
*  Off the backs of the devastation and the pain. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4484.86s)]
*  I've been really vocal about that. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4489.26s)]
*  And this is the creep you get what you're talking about. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4491.26s)]
*  There's social justice. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4496.22s)]
*  Well, now let's say in the palisades, let's start building a whole bunch of low income [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4497.22s)]
*  housing. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4502.1s)]
*  I'm all for low income housing. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4503.1s)]
*  I'm building workforce housing for our employees that are low income because I want to make [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4504.46s)]
*  sure they have a home. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4508.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'm all into that. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4510.14s)]
*  But now is not the time to do it in a neighborhood that's been devastated. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4512.38s)]
*  Also, you're going to have people that won't be able to move back to their neighborhood [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4517.9800000000005s)]
*  because they may not be wealthy, but they may make more money than what is required [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4524.34s)]
*  to move into a low income apartment. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4530.9400000000005s)]
*  They can't move back. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4533.58s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4535.54s)]
*  That's not fair. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4536.54s)]
*  If you want to do that, what I've told the elected officials is provide an incentive, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4537.54s)]
*  not a requirement. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4543.14s)]
*  If you build some low income units in an apartment building you're replacing, we all [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4545.14s)]
*  let me back up. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4550.34s)]
*  So we have this crazy law in the city of Los Angeles. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4551.5s)]
*  Crazy law in the city of Los Angeles is something of this effect. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4555.34s)]
*  I mean, I get it exactly right. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4557.9800000000005s)]
*  If you tear down an existing apartment building that's market rate, you have to replace it [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4561.06s)]
*  with low income housing. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4567.700000000001s)]
*  OK. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4569.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's all of it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4570.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's not all of it. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4573.54s)]
*  I think it's the majority of it. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4574.94s)]
*  But whatever the number is, OK. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4575.94s)]
*  My point is when you do that, you provide a disincentive to reinvest in the city. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4579.34s)]
*  So let's turn it around and provide an incentive. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4585.82s)]
*  Say if you close, knock it down and rebuild or it's burned down in the palisades and want [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4588.86s)]
*  to rebuild, then give a bonus density and allow that person to build more to compensate [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4594.26s)]
*  them for providing housing that is low income. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4600.74s)]
*  Right? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4605.179999999999s)]
*  Just seems to be more fair. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4606.179999999999s)]
*  Everybody gets a bigger. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4607.86s)]
*  How would you do that? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4608.86s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4609.86s)]
*  Well, let's say you have a 12 unit apartment building that burned down in the palisades. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4610.86s)]
*  Instead of requiring low income housing for let's say 20, 30, 40 percent of it, say instead [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4614.62s)]
*  of building 12, we're going to let you build 20 units. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4620.54s)]
*  And out of the 20 units, give us six units that are low income housing, whatever the [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4624.38s)]
*  numbers are. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4627.46s)]
*  But let's have government start thinking about an incentive based system. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4629.46s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4634.78s)]
*  I mean, you look at your life or my life or the people that work here, the harder you [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4635.78s)]
*  work, the more that you do, you're more rewarded. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4640.62s)]
*  Right? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4644.14s)]
*  You're not required to work harder. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4645.14s)]
*  You're incentivized to work harder or work smarter. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4648.62s)]
*  And I think if we build that kind of thinking into government to provide capital, to provide [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4651.9400000000005s)]
*  especially on the rebuilding, you can have some social policies that are very important [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4657.86s)]
*  and very good, like low income. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4662.82s)]
*  What I would even say is why don't we why don't we give an incentive to build workforce [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4665.46s)]
*  housing in the palisades and Altadena where the workforce housing goes to the first responders, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4670.5s)]
*  firefighters, police and teachers. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4677.62s)]
*  So now you can have firefighters, police and teachers living in the neighborhoods they're [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4682.259999999999s)]
*  serving. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4686.179999999999s)]
*  As you know, L.A. is so expensive, most of the cops drive two hours to get home and two [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4687.34s)]
*  hours to get to work. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4692.06s)]
*  Same with the firefighters. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4693.66s)]
*  You want them to be in the neighborhood they serve. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4695.42s)]
*  That's a great public policy. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4698.62s)]
*  Do it around an incentive. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4699.860000000001s)]
*  Especially in a place like the Pacific Palisades, I think people deeply resent the idea of being [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4702.3s)]
*  forced to have any kind of low income housing. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4706.9800000000005s)]
*  The idea is that it's hard to live in the palisades. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4710.5s)]
*  It's expensive. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4712.54s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4713.54s)]
*  It's a beautiful, incredible piece of land, or it was, before the fires devastated it. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4714.74s)]
*  It was a glorious place to live. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4718.7s)]
*  It was very difficult to afford to live there. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4720.5s)]
*  So the people that made the most money were the ones who could buy the homes there. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4723.34s)]
*  They don't want someone to open up low income housing in the same neighborhood that's very [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4727.42s)]
*  difficult to live in. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4732.26s)]
*  The whole idea is that you make enough money where you could live in a place that's very [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4733.7s)]
*  difficult to live in, but it's beautiful and it's really safe. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4738.06s)]
*  And that's what the palisades was. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4741.3s)]
*  They don't want this to be replaced with low income housing. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4743.04s)]
*  They don't want incentives for it to be replaced with low income housing. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4746.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, Joe. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4749.64s)]
*  I think there's people, I think there's a lot of people that would be very excited to [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4751.4s)]
*  have workforce housing, especially if you tie your workforce housing into first responders. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4757.36s)]
*  And I think there's people that would allow- [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4763.2s)]
*  That's different though. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4764.76s)]
*  That's different than apartment buildings. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4765.76s)]
*  They're low income apartment buildings. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4767.24s)]
*  But even in an apartment setting, I think it can work. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4769.24s)]
*  I mean, listen, I think there's people in the palisades that would very much welcome [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4771.76s)]
*  affordable housing, low income housing. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4776.280000000001s)]
*  I certainly wouldn't have a big landowner in the palisades. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4778.0s)]
*  But what I don't like about it is the requirement off the backs of people who have lost everything. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4782.04s)]
*  That's just not right. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4788.96s)]
*  That's not the time to do it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4790.06s)]
*  If you want to go rezone stuff, let the place get rebuilt and let people get back on their [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4791.12s)]
*  feet and then go have that discussion. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4796.88s)]
*  It's a timing issue on it, in my opinion. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4799.24s)]
*  But listen, there's a lot of issues the city's got to tackle to get these places rebuilt. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4802.08s)]
*  It's immensely complicated. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4806.8s)]
*  And again, I mean, I'll be very honest, the government just cannot do it alone. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4809.88s)]
*  There's just no way. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4814.76s)]
*  There's just no way. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4815.76s)]
*  One of the things that people complain a lot about California is regulations. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4817.679999999999s)]
*  And how regulated it is and how difficult it is to start businesses and to maintain [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4821.96s)]
*  businesses. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4827.08s)]
*  It's not regulated. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4828.08s)]
*  What can be done about that? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4829.08s)]
*  Cut through the red tape. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4830.72s)]
*  We have more regulations. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4831.76s)]
*  It's insane to run a business. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4832.96s)]
*  I run a business, obviously, in LA and in California. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4834.76s)]
*  And it's to the point that I would never restart the business in LA and in California. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4838.36s)]
*  It's too expensive. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4846.18s)]
*  The tax rates are too high for everybody, not just people that are making money. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4847.84s)]
*  I'm talking about people who are moderate, hardworking people. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4851.72s)]
*  Tax rates too high. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4856.48s)]
*  And regulation on small businesses in Los Angeles, you have businesses now closing because [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4857.879999999999s)]
*  of it's overregulated. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4863.24s)]
*  And then it got even frankly worse post-COVID because a lot of the restrictions they took [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4864.5199999999995s)]
*  away during COVID in order to allow businesses to survive and restaurants to operate, they [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4869.48s)]
*  started taking them away. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4874.48s)]
*  Like just having outdoor dining. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4876.36s)]
*  Like why would you do that? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4878.599999999999s)]
*  Why would you make it more difficult for a small business owner to operate a restaurant? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4880.16s)]
*  So that gets back to like the business approach to running government. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4885.04s)]
*  Let people prosper. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4890.8s)]
*  Have a system. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4892.62s)]
*  There's certain laws you need, obviously, to operate safely and smartly. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4893.62s)]
*  But have a system that people can earn money, become successful. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4897.4s)]
*  What's the cause of more regulation? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4901.68s)]
*  How does it start? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4903.84s)]
*  I don't know, Joe. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4904.84s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4906.28s)]
*  I think that there's a group of people that feel like government is the only way that [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4907.28s)]
*  society can be safe and regulated. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4912.5199999999995s)]
*  That people left on their own will go crazy and do terrible things running around the [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4916.08s)]
*  streets. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4923.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's just not the way it works, right? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4924.5599999999995s)]
*  Capitalism is a really good system. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4927.679999999999s)]
*  We've proven that. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4929.36s)]
*  And overregulation starts squeezing capitalism to the point that it pushes out people from [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4931.24s)]
*  investing in creating jobs and creating opportunity. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4937.76s)]
*  And L.A. has gotten to the point, it's certainly over the bridge and needs to get pulled back. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4942.8s)]
*  I mean, I can't even tell you how overregulated it is. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4947.12s)]
*  And then on top of it, in L.A. now, we have too few cops. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4950.240000000001s)]
*  And so the obligation to protect your property is getting pushed to private landowners. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4957.16s)]
*  And so like on our shopping centers, we have a very safe environment, friendly environment, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4962.700000000001s)]
*  family environment, all those kind of things we're very protective of. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4967.900000000001s)]
*  LAPD wants to do the right thing. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4972.22s)]
*  They don't have the resources. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4974.02s)]
*  So we've had to supplement it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4975.14s)]
*  Millions and millions of dollars of private security. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4977.18s)]
*  And that's a whole nother problem because what about the individual landowner in a neighborhood [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4980.740000000001s)]
*  that doesn't have the kind of protection they need? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4985.84s)]
*  They don't have the police force to protect them and running a business becomes impossible. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4989.82s)]
*  So and again, those things are just fixable. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4996.139999999999s)]
*  They really are fixable. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=4999.82s)]
*  So regulations, water, law and order, what are the things are giant issues about L.A. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5001.86s)]
*  that you think need to be addressed? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5010.099999999999s)]
*  Well, I think we have to on the positive side. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5013.5s)]
*  I want to be more business friendly. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5018.18s)]
*  I want to I want to invite businesses back to California. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5020.5s)]
*  I want to invite businesses back to L.A. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5023.18s)]
*  That's tough. So I want to get Elon back to L.A. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5025.1s)]
*  I don't want him to leave L.A. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5028.860000000001s)]
*  I've told him that, you know, and I think he would come back. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5030.900000000001s)]
*  I think all these businesses would come back. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5034.14s)]
*  Sure. If it was reasonable, if it was reasonable, they didn't leave because it was awesome. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5036.06s)]
*  That's what people have done. I didn't leave because it was awesome. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5040.34s)]
*  Right. I left because I just didn't want this group of people that I thought were in that [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5042.9800000000005s)]
*  telling me what to do. Of course. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5047.54s)]
*  And they gave you in a weird way, they gave you the incentive to leave and not the incentive to stay. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5049.34s)]
*  Yes. I want to give people the incentive to stay. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5055.1s)]
*  Start your business, grow your business, raise your family. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5057.5s)]
*  Let's protect you. Clean the streets. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5060.66s)]
*  You know, all of those basic things are really important. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5062.9s)]
*  And again, Joe, maybe I'm overly optimistic in it, but it can come back. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5066.54s)]
*  And I think California, if unleashed is just a mighty powerhouse, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5071.62s)]
*  it could really change the direction of this whole country. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5076.7s)]
*  The innovation that we have in California, the technical knowledge, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5079.7s)]
*  what's happening in our universities, some of the best in the world, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5083.0599999999995s)]
*  what's happening in the tech field with AI, it's all based here in California. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5088.54s)]
*  And you've got to let that flourish. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5093.7s)]
*  You know, set the platform that's encouraging these youngest, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5095.38s)]
*  brightest minds to come here and start your business. Right. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5099.66s)]
*  And do the right thing. You've made the point. You're absolutely right. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5103.3s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of the tech people. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5107.38s)]
*  You know, they want a different leadership that is supporting the growth of technology [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5110.3s)]
*  that's going to change the world. It's going to happen somewhere. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5117.1s)]
*  We saw it happen in China with their new AI company. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5121.66s)]
*  And we better be prepared to be the best at it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5126.38s)]
*  And we have to provide the platform to do that. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5130.1s)]
*  So in order to incentivize people, if they wanted to come back to California, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5133.22s)]
*  you've got these enormous taxes. Right. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5140.1s)]
*  So something has to be done on a state level, not just on a city level. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5143.58s)]
*  That's right. To address that. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5146.58s)]
*  So how do you address that? You should have competitive tax rates. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5148.54s)]
*  I don't know why California needs to tax people much higher than any other state. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5151.700000000001s)]
*  Why would you? The cost of operating a state, you know, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5156.740000000001s)]
*  you've got very sophisticated states, very dense states. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5159.46s)]
*  It's a matter of setting priorities. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5162.74s)]
*  And we've got to look at the tax code to make it fair. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5164.9s)]
*  We've got the highest gas costs in the country. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5167.5s)]
*  Why does a gallon of gas in California cost more than a gallon of gas in the world? [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5172.3s)]
*  Well, isn't that because in California, you're required to sell gas that's refined in California? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5175.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case. See if that's the case, Jamie. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5180.3s)]
*  But I know I think the gas in California is also highly taxed. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5183.5s)]
*  Of course. Why wouldn't they? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5188.0199999999995s)]
*  This is the question, though, Rick. It's like, where's all this money going? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5190.26s)]
*  I don't know. If you've got this insanely high tax rate, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5193.06s)]
*  but yet you don't have any money to fix the power lines, you've got this insanely high tax rate, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5195.54s)]
*  but you can't clean up the homeless problem. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5200.46s)]
*  And even though you throw in a lot of money on it, where's that money going? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5202.3s)]
*  I don't know. It's not going to the school system. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5205.34s)]
*  They need to get these super nerds that are on top of this department of government efficiency [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5207.54s)]
*  and set them loose, set them loose on California. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5212.62s)]
*  We've got a lot of smart people in California, along with them, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5215.62s)]
*  that really want to help the system. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5218.82s)]
*  And I think the minute you bring some really smart people. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5221.78s)]
*  This is what I did with this foundation. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5224.98s)]
*  You look at the list of people that are donating their time and talent. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5226.74s)]
*  They're just brilliant people. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5230.299999999999s)]
*  I made one phone call to each of them. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5233.299999999999s)]
*  Would you give me your time and talent? I don't want a dollar from you. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5235.86s)]
*  Yes, I'm in. Whatever it is, I'm in. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5239.179999999999s)]
*  And that's what we need to do more of is have the elected officials have the courage [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5244.26s)]
*  and the competency to reach out and get the smartest people in different industries [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5249.5s)]
*  to come in and help get their ideas and then implement them. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5254.38s)]
*  That's the greatest form of government. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5259.900000000001s)]
*  Whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, it doesn't really matter if you got great ideas. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5262.820000000001s)]
*  And if you're a big thinker, that's what I would do. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5266.9800000000005s)]
*  That's what I am doing. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5270.66s)]
*  But on a state level, like the taxes for the state, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5272.34s)]
*  that would have to be addressed by the governor, right? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5275.900000000001s)]
*  The governor and the legislature, yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5278.540000000001s)]
*  What could be done about that? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5280.5s)]
*  I think you've got to rebuild it, Joe. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5282.34s)]
*  I don't want to give you a specific proposal here, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5286.18s)]
*  but it doesn't need to be as high as it is in order to operate the state of California [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5288.9400000000005s)]
*  if the state of California has their priorities right of what they're spending money on. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5293.860000000001s)]
*  And by the way, the best way, and we learned this from Reagan, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5297.46s)]
*  to raise revenue for the government is to allow businesses and families to grow [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5302.06s)]
*  and create jobs and industries, not to suppress them. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5307.14s)]
*  So the many you keep overtaxing people, all you're doing is giving people the incentive to leave, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5312.14s)]
*  which we've seen, right? [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5317.54s)]
*  The exodus. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5319.18s)]
*  If you start giving people a rate that allows them to be benefited by staying in the state of California, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5320.9400000000005s)]
*  that business will grow and California is going to make more revenue. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5326.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not rocket science. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5329.339999999999s)]
*  It's just simple logic. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5330.54s)]
*  The economy grows. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5331.179999999999s)]
*  People have more money. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5332.94s)]
*  It's better for everybody. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5334.0199999999995s)]
*  And you get some jobs. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5335.0599999999995s)]
*  You get people off the streets. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5336.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5337.419999999999s)]
*  You know, this whole thing starts changing the dynamic. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5337.98s)]
*  How great would that be? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5341.139999999999s)]
*  It would be pretty incredible. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5342.299999999999s)]
*  I just don't want to get my hopes up. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5343.5s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5344.7s)]
*  No, no, come on. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5345.219999999999s)]
*  Don't leave me. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5347.379999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5348.459999999999s)]
*  I think it's possible. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5350.259999999999s)]
*  It's just a daunting task. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5351.5s)]
*  It is a daunting task. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5353.0199999999995s)]
*  But OK, I'm not throwing flowers at you. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5354.1s)]
*  Look at what you've accomplished in your career. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5356.9400000000005s)]
*  That was a daunting task. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5359.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't think about it. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5361.5s)]
*  It just sort of lucked out. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5363.42s)]
*  It wasn't luck. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5365.14s)]
*  Well, whatever it was. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5365.900000000001s)]
*  It was a little bit of luck. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5366.5s)]
*  Everybody's got a little bit of luck. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5367.780000000001s)]
*  For sure. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5368.900000000001s)]
*  It was a hell of a lot of hard work and you were very focused and you had your head down [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5369.42s)]
*  and you just kept going forward. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5372.780000000001s)]
*  So it can be done. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5374.38s)]
*  I couldn't do what you did. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5375.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you could. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5377.42s)]
*  No, no, you're a stud. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5377.9400000000005s)]
*  I couldn't. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5379.46s)]
*  I can. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5380.02s)]
*  It can be done. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5380.54s)]
*  In fact, I just want to go on a tangent for a second. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5380.9800000000005s)]
*  Sure. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5382.66s)]
*  OK, my boys got me addicted to taking an ice bath. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5384.5s)]
*  You're insane. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5391.3s)]
*  What's the temperature of yours? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5393.0199999999995s)]
*  Thirty four. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5395.099999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5395.9s)]
*  OK, I saw a picture of you removing a sheet of ice. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5396.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5399.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5400.22s)]
*  I'm nowhere near the stud that you are, obviously. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5401.0199999999995s)]
*  It's not that hard. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5405.22s)]
*  It's just three minutes and it makes the rest of the day. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5406.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm at 50. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5408.3s)]
*  50 is cold. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5409.3s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm addicted to it. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5410.62s)]
*  How long are you in for? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5412.62s)]
*  Three minutes. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5413.74s)]
*  You'll still get the benefits at 50. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5414.62s)]
*  OK. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5416.42s)]
*  What I get at 30 is much more suck [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5417.02s)]
*  and getting through the suck is part of it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5419.7s)]
*  How long is the suck part? [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5422.900000000001s)]
*  Sucks for about a minute. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5424.42s)]
*  Yeah, the first minute. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5425.62s)]
*  The first minute really sucks. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5426.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's with me at 50. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5427.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I took a... [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5429.46s)]
*  I'm like heavy breathing. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5430.26s)]
*  I got some stem cells shot into my shoulder recently [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5431.14s)]
*  and when I do that, you have to take like 72 hours [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5433.5s)]
*  because the actual inflammation is actually [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5436.1s)]
*  from the initial injection to heal the area. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5439.259999999999s)]
*  And so I took three days off and it's funny, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5442.42s)]
*  just taking three days off when you get back in, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5445.139999999999s)]
*  the suck is worse. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5447.66s)]
*  Yeah, but it doesn't... [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5448.82s)]
*  For me, it doesn't get any easier though. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5450.219999999999s)]
*  It doesn't? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5452.66s)]
*  After the first minute? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5453.54s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5454.38s)]
*  Oh, every day. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5455.38s)]
*  Every day. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5456.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it gets a little easier. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5456.62s)]
*  It never gets easy, but it gets a little... [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5458.5s)]
*  It's like it's easier now. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5460.58s)]
*  Like three days... [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5461.58s)]
*  Like now I'm like four or five days in. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5462.259999999999s)]
*  It's like, so when I pop the lid off of it, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5464.219999999999s)]
*  I just... [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5466.7s)]
*  I don't even think about it. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5467.099999999999s)]
*  I just go, get in there. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5467.94s)]
*  Just shut up, put the timer on, get in there. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5469.54s)]
*  Just sit. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5472.0599999999995s)]
*  Just sit there. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5473.419999999999s)]
*  I do love it. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5474.259999999999s)]
*  But the thing about it is the way you feel [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5474.74s)]
*  when you get out is so amazing. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5477.46s)]
*  You feel alive, you feel energized, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5480.86s)]
*  you feel like your brain is firing, all your endorphin. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5484.259999999999s)]
*  It kicks up your dopamine levels by 200%. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5487.66s)]
*  It lasts for hours and hours. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5490.099999999999s)]
*  You feel wonderful. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5492.46s)]
*  And that's the thing. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5493.9s)]
*  It's like we need to delay gratitude. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5494.7s)]
*  You need to delay these... [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5496.82s)]
*  People like to feel comfortable now. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5499.74s)]
*  You need to delay that. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5502.86s)]
*  Put that on the side. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5504.26s)]
*  I like that. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5505.54s)]
*  Just suck it up for a while. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5506.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5508.219999999999s)]
*  Doing that, forcing yourself to have voluntary adversity, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5509.0599999999995s)]
*  just have three minutes a day that's horrible, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5512.219999999999s)]
*  is going to make the whole rest of your day better. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5515.54s)]

*  going on Twitter, what are these people? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5525.179999999999s)]
*  Talking about three minutes. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5526.62s)]
*  No, it's addicting to me. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5529.22s)]
*  I never thought I would be addicted to it. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5530.46s)]
*  I love it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5532.86s)]

*  And the other thing I love, which I heard you do, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5534.18s)]
*  is the infrared. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5536.5s)]
*  Yeah, I do that too. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5537.58s)]
*  I do that today. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5538.34s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5540.62s)]
*  Oh, you're talking infrared sauna. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5541.22s)]
*  I do a red light bed every day. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5542.66s)]
*  I do a regular sauna, a dry sauna, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5544.54s)]
*  because I think there's more research that's been done, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5546.74s)]
*  particularly out of Finland. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5551.3s)]
*  They did a 20-year study where they showed a 40% [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5553.18s)]
*  decrease in all-cause mortality for people [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5556.1s)]
*  who use the sauna four days a week. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5559.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5561.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5561.780000000001s)]
*  More than an infrared? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5562.46s)]
*  Just an old-fashioned dry sauna? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5563.660000000001s)]
*  Not more than an infrared. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5565.58s)]
*  I think infrared is definitely beneficial. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5567.02s)]
*  The whole idea is heat shock proteins. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5569.42s)]
*  The whole idea is raising your body temperature [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5571.620000000001s)]
*  to the point where your body develops these heat shock [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5574.22s)]
*  proteins in order to mitigate the effects of the extreme [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5576.9400000000005s)]
*  heat, because you can only tolerate that extreme heat [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5579.700000000001s)]
*  for a certain amount of time. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5582.06s)]
*  A regular dry sauna gets way hotter. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5584.38s)]
*  So my sauna, I like to keep it at 196. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5586.9400000000005s)]
*  So I get in there at 196 for 25 minutes. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5590.22s)]
*  And it's not fun. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5593.26s)]
*  It's not fun. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5594.78s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5595.5s)]
*  But that stress of doing that is what [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5596.5s)]
*  makes your body stronger. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5599.82s)]
*  It's the response, your body's response, [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5601.18s)]
*  to that extreme stress that makes it stronger. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5603.5s)]
*  And this is what develops the heat shock proteins. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5605.9800000000005s)]
*  And this is what is responsible for this. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5608.22s)]
*  There's an EPO-like effect on your blood, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5613.14s)]
*  where you have more red blood cells. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5616.780000000001s)]
*  It raises your endurance. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5618.5s)]
*  It's almost like static cardio. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5620.18s)]
*  Even though you're sitting there, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5624.02s)]
*  I wear a heart rate monitor sometimes when I'm in there. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5625.58s)]
*  And my heart's jacked up to 147 beats a minute at the end. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5627.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty high. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5631.06s)]
*  When you're hitting that 21-minute mark, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5632.9800000000005s)]
*  and you're looking at your watch going, oh, Jesus Christ, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5634.9400000000005s)]
*  four more minutes of this shit. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5637.42s)]
*  Is your recovery quick once you get out, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5639.1s)]
*  your heart rates down? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5640.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm so used to it. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5641.94s)]
*  But another benefit is living in Texas. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5643.219999999999s)]
*  When I go out in the heat and the sun, [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5646.299999999999s)]
*  it doesn't bother me at all. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5647.9s)]
*  My body's fully adapted to being hot. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5649.099999999999s)]
*  It's hot every day. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5652.74s)]
*  And that's, again, it's just voluntary adversity. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5654.54s)]
*  It's forcing yourself to do something physically. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5658.219999999999s)]
*  And it makes the rest of your day way easier. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5660.9s)]
*  OK, so you should get into politics. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5663.139999999999s)]
*  Voluntary adversity. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5665.139999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5666.379999999999s)]
*  Voluntary adversity. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5667.94s)]
*  I would way rather have people like you [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5669.339999999999s)]
*  go on and try to help you out than get involved myself. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5671.26s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5673.820000000001s)]
*  I'm grateful for that. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5674.820000000001s)]
*  Zero interest in getting involved myself. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5675.900000000001s)]
*  Is this where your interests end, though? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5678.1s)]
*  Is it just mayor stuff, or do you ever look bigger than that? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5680.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5683.820000000001s)]
*  Right now, honestly, I was looking at a couple [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5684.7s)]
*  of different options. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5687.9400000000005s)]
*  And then when January 7th hit with the fire, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5690.3s)]
*  the world sort of stopped. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5692.820000000001s)]
*  And I want to spend a lot of time right now trying [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5694.900000000001s)]
*  to get it rebuilt. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5696.9400000000005s)]
*  There's going to be time for politics for me, for sure. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5697.780000000001s)]
*  It's probably not right now. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5701.18s)]
*  So you think one day governor, one day president? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5702.58s)]
*  Well, I don't. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5706.58s)]
*  Come on. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5707.660000000001s)]
*  Come on, Rick. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5708.820000000001s)]
*  You know what I want to do? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5710.62s)]
*  I look at it, and I don't mean this in a morbid way. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5712.820000000001s)]
*  I mean it in a positive way. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5716.02s)]
*  I'm sort of at the back nine of my life, right? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5718.660000000001s)]
*  And I've had an incredible life. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5721.06s)]
*  And so what can I do that's really [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5723.34s)]
*  meaningful at this point? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5726.62s)]
*  And I enjoy public service a lot. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5728.62s)]
*  I enjoyed when I worked for three different mayors. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5731.82s)]
*  And so I do want to do something at some point. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5735.34s)]
*  But the question for me is, where is the place [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5738.0199999999995s)]
*  that I can do the most good? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5741.5s)]
*  And have a good time doing it, by the way, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5743.54s)]
*  because I like having fun. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5745.5s)]
*  And where does that intersect? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5747.94s)]
*  And so as time goes on, I'll figure that out. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5749.22s)]
*  And whether it's the governor or whether it's the mayor, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5752.38s)]
*  I'm not quite sure. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5754.86s)]
*  But I want to do something at some point. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5755.7s)]
*  But now I really want to get the place rebuilt. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5759.299999999999s)]
*  Let's get moving. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5762.219999999999s)]
*  What does that involve? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5764.5s)]
*  You wanted to get the place rebuilt. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5766.219999999999s)]
*  So how long is this woman still going to be the mayor for? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5767.66s)]
*  Well, she's there for, I think, about 18 months or so. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5771.54s)]
*  And she already announced before the fires [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5775.38s)]
*  she's going to run for reelection. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5777.7s)]
*  But we'll see how that plays out. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5780.219999999999s)]
*  As a private citizen, it's this group [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5782.179999999999s)]
*  that I put together that's going to work really closely, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5784.7s)]
*  pushing the city, finding solutions, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5788.38s)]
*  calling out when they're not doing [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5792.0599999999995s)]
*  what they need to be doing. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5793.86s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that that's going to be really effective. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5796.42s)]
*  And like I said, bending the curve, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5799.34s)]
*  shortening the timeline to get people in. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5801.099999999999s)]
*  And that's going to take most of my time and most of my day. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5803.42s)]
*  I got a small, mighty staff that I hired for it. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5807.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm going to fund it myself. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5809.94s)]
*  I'm going to use all the resources from my company [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5812.7s)]
*  and the talent we have in the company [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5815.26s)]
*  to help find answers to rebuild it. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5816.78s)]
*  We got guys like Joe Lonsdale is a part of that group, one [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5819.5s)]
*  of the biggest thinkers around. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5823.86s)]
*  I got the head of Parsons, one of the great Gensler [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5825.0599999999995s)]
*  architectural firms. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5829.3s)]
*  Everybody's donating time and talent. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5830.26s)]
*  And so we want to push the needle on this thing. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5832.54s)]
*  And then politics will come down the road. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5834.74s)]
*  We'll figure that out. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5836.7s)]
*  Well, that sounds wonderful. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5837.46s)]
*  But it seems to me that unless you're at the cockpit, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5838.7s)]
*  unless you're controlling the direction of the city, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5841.78s)]
*  it's going to be very hard to really change [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5846.78s)]
*  things in a meaningful way. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5848.66s)]
*  It's a good challenge, for sure. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5851.259999999999s)]
*  But I can't change the leadership that's there now. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5854.099999999999s)]
*  And the problem is now. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5857.58s)]
*  So I got to figure out how I help [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5860.0199999999995s)]
*  the leadership be successful. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5862.139999999999s)]
*  Has the leadership adjusted their perspective [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5864.7s)]
*  based on this enormous failure of the fire? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5866.94s)]
*  Because it seems like politically, that's [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5869.66s)]
*  a giant handicap for them, right? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5871.3s)]
*  Obviously, it was a huge disaster. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5873.38s)]
*  So in order to get re-elected, you [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5875.74s)]
*  have to give these people some faith [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5877.86s)]
*  that you've recognized that you've made some errors [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5881.34s)]
*  and that you're going to do things [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5884.0599999999995s)]
*  differently in the future. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5885.5s)]
*  I haven't heard that. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5886.26s)]
*  I haven't heard that. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5887.66s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5888.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5889.42s)]
*  But I'll be really honest with you. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5890.099999999999s)]
*  I'm always honest with you, with everybody. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5891.9s)]
*  When you're a leader and you weren't [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5895.62s)]
*  around to help prevent the problem, [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5898.94s)]
*  probably highly unlikely you're going [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5901.66s)]
*  to be able to fix the problem, if that was your judgment. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5903.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5907.0599999999995s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5907.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5908.179999999999s)]
*  So if your judgment was, I'm going [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5908.98s)]
*  to go out of town when this catastrophic event is [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5911.419999999999s)]
*  about to hit the city that I'm in charge of, [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5915.099999999999s)]
*  you probably don't have the judgment to get it fixed. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5918.62s)]
*  I hope I'm wrong. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5922.82s)]
*  But I'm going to do whatever I can to help, [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5924.66s)]
*  because the problem is bigger than the politics [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5928.54s)]
*  and the problem is bigger than her. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5930.98s)]
*  And the people that are suffering [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5933.46s)]
*  shouldn't be suffering because of her or anything [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5935.42s)]
*  that she did or who she appointed [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5938.58s)]
*  that failed in their job. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5940.98s)]
*  We've got to do a workaround. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5942.98s)]
*  It's the only option I've got right now. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5945.3s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5947.34s)]
*  And that's what I'm going to do. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5948.26s)]
*  That's very practical. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5949.5s)]
*  Is there anything else that you would think of that needs [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5951.46s)]
*  to be discussed about LA and that you think could be fixed? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5953.82s)]
*  You know? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5959.3s)]
*  We cover the regulations. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5959.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5960.86s)]
*  What about desalination? [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5961.36s)]
*  Absolutely should be done. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5964.0199999999995s)]
*  Great idea. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5966.94s)]
*  I tried it when I was head of Department of Water and Power. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5968.1s)]
*  Yeah? [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5970.66s)]
*  Got fought by every environmental group there is. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5971.78s)]
*  Why? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5974.62s)]
*  Do they think we're going to empty the entire ocean? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5975.18s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5977.74s)]
*  There's so much water right there. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5979.66s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5981.3s)]
*  First of all, we're dumping sewage. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5982.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, there's tertiary treatment [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5985.0199999999995s)]
*  where water is potable. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5986.62s)]
*  We dump sewage secondary treatment. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5988.42s)]
*  Doesn't hurt the ocean, but we're dumping it. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5991.22s)]
*  Take it to tertiary treatment. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5993.62s)]
*  Put it back in the natural underground aquifers [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=5995.7s)]
*  and save it. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6000.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6001.5s)]
*  Right? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6002.0s)]
*  That can be done. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6002.5s)]
*  The abundance of water that goes into the ocean [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6003.42s)]
*  is sort of what you start out with. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6005.86s)]
*  Desal, brilliant. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6007.38s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6010.34s)]
*  We should be doing it. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6011.06s)]
*  We should have desal plants supporting Los Angeles [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6011.9800000000005s)]
*  and big parts of the Southern California. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6015.14s)]
*  Also, it creates jobs. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6017.26s)]
*  Creates jobs. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6018.74s)]
*  You can do it where it's environmentally safe. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6020.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6023.1s)]
*  And it has a redundancy of power that comes off of it [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6023.9400000000005s)]
*  also that's helpful. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6028.06s)]
*  Because we've got a power shortage in California. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6028.9400000000005s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6032.46s)]
*  And we've got more and more demand on our grid [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6033.18s)]
*  than we know how to supply right now. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6035.58s)]
*  And again, back in the day. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6037.9800000000005s)]
*  How does it work as a redundancy of power? [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6039.18s)]
*  Well, because you've got to generate [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6041.46s)]
*  a lot of power for the desal. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6043.7s)]
*  When the desal is not operating, you're [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6045.38s)]
*  still got an operating power plant there. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6047.06s)]
*  So you can skew up the operation in order [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6049.620000000001s)]
*  to have additional energy coming off your desal plant. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6052.22s)]
*  OK. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6057.22s)]
*  And you've got to build a power plant [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6057.9400000000005s)]
*  to desal because of the amount of power [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6059.860000000001s)]
*  it consumes to clean the water. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6061.580000000001s)]
*  And how much water could be desal? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6063.740000000001s)]
*  How much of an impact can that actually have? [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6067.22s)]
*  Does it depend upon the size of the plant [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6069.34s)]
*  and how many of them there are? [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6070.96s)]
*  It depends on the size of the plant. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6071.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6073.1s)]
*  Depends on the size of the plant. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6073.740000000001s)]
*  Ideally, they should be set up, though, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6075.54s)]
*  like at various intervals along the coast. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6077.9s)]
*  And you'd probably fix the entire. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6081.1s)]
*  I mean, California could be completely green. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6082.58s)]
*  Well, listen, it could be. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6085.54s)]
*  But it's also, you mix sources of water. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6086.74s)]
*  Like right now, in LA, I'll just take LA. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6090.78s)]
*  You've got the aqueduct that's bringing water down, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6094.58s)]
*  that William Mulholland built at the turn of the century. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6097.9s)]
*  He was brilliant on how he did it. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6100.54s)]
*  There isn't one pump. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6102.5s)]
*  It's all gravity flow that comes down from Inyo County, [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6103.8s)]
*  Owens Valley comes down. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6107.64s)]
*  There was a whole bunch of controversy and everything. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6109.56s)]
*  But all of that has sort of been fixed. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6111.6s)]
*  That water comes down. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6115.360000000001s)]
*  There's some water that comes down from the state. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6116.4400000000005s)]
*  There's water that Los Angeles has natural aquifers. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6118.400000000001s)]
*  We pump, right? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6121.76s)]
*  Again, if you, and then you add desal to it, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6124.360000000001s)]
*  then you have one more supply that's backing up supply. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6127.400000000001s)]
*  And then, of course, you want to capture rainwater, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6130.96s)]
*  which we do a terrible job of. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6133.64s)]
*  We let it go in the ocean. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6135.3s)]
*  We don't capture as much rainwater in Los Angeles [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6136.42s)]
*  as we should, probably not much at all. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6139.52s)]
*  But even with the sewage, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6142.88s)]
*  why wouldn't you just spend the investment [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6145.72s)]
*  and take the treatment and put it back in the aquifer [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6148.58s)]
*  and have clean water? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6152.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6153.64s)]
*  It's just a constant supply. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6154.4800000000005s)]
*  All we're doing now is we're dumping it in the ocean. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6156.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's very stupid. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6159.08s)]
*  And again, it's doing the same thing you've always done [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6160.08s)]
*  and hoping for a different result. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6162.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6164.240000000001s)]
*  What was the pushback from the idea of desalination plants? [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6165.08s)]
*  Because there's a long line of thinkers [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6170.280000000001s)]
*  that there should be no power plants [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6172.96s)]
*  along the coast of California because of the emissions. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6174.6s)]
*  So years ago, when I was president of DWP, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6177.88s)]
*  under Tom Bradley's leadership at the time, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6181.06s)]
*  converted all the old oil plants on the coast [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6183.88s)]
*  to gas to be clean. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6188.52s)]
*  There's better technology now. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6190.139999999999s)]
*  You can convert those. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6194.3s)]
*  They're testing out hydrogen [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6195.66s)]
*  and convert them to hydrogen plants. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6197.139999999999s)]
*  There's a big plant that DWP built in Utah [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6199.219999999999s)]
*  when I was president called Intermountain Power Project. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6202.62s)]
*  It was the cleanest coal burning plant [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6205.54s)]
*  in the country at the time. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6207.719999999999s)]
*  This is probably 25 years ago now, 30 years ago. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6208.759999999999s)]
*  They're now testing and converting it to hydrogen, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6213.0199999999995s)]
*  which will be absolutely clean. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6215.78s)]
*  That's smart, right? [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6217.259999999999s)]
*  Literally makes oxygen. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6219.52s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6220.84s)]
*  The question is how do you boil water? [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6223.16s)]
*  Pick your source. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6225.32s)]
*  That's what a plant does. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6226.4800000000005s)]
*  A plant boils water, creates steam, spends a turbine, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6227.4800000000005s)]
*  you got electricity. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6230.32s)]
*  So whatever kind of fuel you want, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6232.12s)]
*  we were partners in Palo Verde, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6235.32s)]
*  which is the nuclear plant in Arizona. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6237.24s)]
*  We need more nuclear plants in this country. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6239.28s)]
*  And I don't know why the leadership in this state [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6244.16s)]
*  hasn't been aggressive in building more [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6247.040000000001s)]
*  clean burning plants, because we need them. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6250.96s)]
*  Nuclear has a negative stereotype in the public eye, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6253.240000000001s)]
*  unfortunately, because of Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6258.72s)]
*  because of Fukushima. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6262.040000000001s)]
*  People think nuclear, they think disaster. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6263.84s)]
*  They think terrible waste. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6266.4400000000005s)]
*  You can't get away from it. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6269.320000000001s)]
*  It pollutes the ground forever. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6270.8s)]
*  But it can be made very safe. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6272.92s)]
*  But it can be made much safer and much cleaner. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6273.76s)]
*  It's not being done because we're... [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6276.5199999999995s)]
*  And then also people have to understand [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6278.84s)]
*  that if you go back to the cars that were on the road [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6280.88s)]
*  at the time these nuclear power plants were built, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6284.84s)]
*  those cars were polluting like crazy. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6287.12s)]
*  You got a brand new car. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6289.68s)]
*  The emissions are far less. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6290.92s)]
*  Or you get a Tesla, you have none. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6292.68s)]
*  So why would we look at the same old architecture [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6295.08s)]
*  of these... [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6300.24s)]
*  The Fukushima one's a prime example. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6301.16s)]
*  It only had one backup generator. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6303.16s)]
*  The backup generator went out, they were done. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6305.0199999999995s)]
*  They have them now where they can actually shut them down. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6307.139999999999s)]
*  They have, there's new designs. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6309.74s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6311.66s)]
*  And listen, Palo Verde again is probably 20 or 30 years old. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6312.5s)]
*  It's been an incredibly performing plant. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6316.74s)]
*  Never has had a problem. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6319.82s)]
*  So again, this is where you sort of get into [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6321.74s)]
*  what your point is. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6324.459999999999s)]
*  Get somebody from the outside who's thinking big, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6325.62s)]
*  who's thinking outside the box, [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6328.9s)]
*  who wants to change the landscape [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6331.3s)]
*  for the better way of having a quality of life [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6333.66s)]
*  and is willing to think big. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6338.1s)]
*  And you're gonna get kicked in the head sometimes [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6339.54s)]
*  and not every idea is gonna make sense and work. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6341.26s)]
*  But you only get there if you throw enough good ideas [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6344.7s)]
*  out on the table that you figure things out, right? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6347.08s)]
*  And so when you take a look at Los Angeles, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6349.26s)]
*  when you take a look at California, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6352.24s)]
*  I'm hopeful that you get leadership [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6354.4400000000005s)]
*  that just starts looking at things differently [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6356.62s)]
*  and will make some small moves that turns into big changes. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6359.3s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6362.860000000001s)]
*  Again, I'm optimistic about it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6364.42s)]
*  Well, I'm optimistic too, I am. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6366.1s)]
*  We're gonna get you back there, Joe. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6368.42s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6370.02s)]
*  I'm never leaving Texas. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6370.860000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6372.18s)]
*  I'll never live in a big city again. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6375.02s)]
*  I think you get too big, it's just people become a burden. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6377.1s)]
*  I think that there's a psychic aspect to it. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6381.6s)]
*  Just the mindset of living in a smaller place [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6385.24s)]
*  that's more relaxed, it just feels better. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6388.1s)]
*  I get it. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6391.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6392.14s)]
*  I get that, especially raising a family. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6392.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6394.740000000001s)]
*  But I did love living in LA. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6395.58s)]
*  I lived there for 25 years, I loved it. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6397.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6399.34s)]
*  I thought it was awesome. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6400.18s)]
*  Had a great time there. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6401.0s)]
*  I still miss parts of it, I still miss the Comedy Store [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6403.06s)]
*  and I still miss, you know. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6405.3s)]
*  There's amazing aspects to LA still [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6407.700000000001s)]
*  and there's an amazing group of human beings [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6411.860000000001s)]
*  that live in LA still. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6413.740000000001s)]
*  It's an incredible city. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6414.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6415.740000000001s)]
*  The problem is everyone knew that it was amazing [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6416.58s)]
*  and everyone knew that everybody wanted to go there [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6420.9s)]
*  and so they just sort of took everybody for granted. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6423.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6426.22s)]
*  And they said, look, let's just tax the shit [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6427.0599999999995s)]
*  out of these people. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6427.9s)]
*  They're staying, they're not going anywhere, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6428.9s)]
*  it's California. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6430.68s)]
*  Where are you gonna go? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6431.66s)]
*  That's right. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6432.5s)]
*  There's still that attitude, by the way. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6433.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6434.46s)]
*  Still that attitude. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6435.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I felt. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6436.42s)]
*  Doesn't work. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6437.62s)]
*  That's what I felt. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6438.78s)]
*  And that's what you hear from the governor [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6439.66s)]
*  and you hear from people when they brag about California, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6441.34s)]
*  instead of addressing why are people leaving, [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6445.46s)]
*  they talk about how great California is. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6447.38s)]
*  I work, I can ask. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6448.7s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, still, but not as much as before [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6449.8s)]
*  and there's a reason, you're on a downward trend. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6453.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6455.26s)]
*  It's the government. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6456.1s)]
*  And not as much as we could. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6456.92s)]
*  Yeah, not as much as we could. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6458.22s)]
*  Well, listen, Rick, whatever you do, I wish you the best. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6459.82s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6462.66s)]
*  I really, I do hope you run for mayor again [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6463.5s)]
*  and I hope you win this time [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6465.58s)]
*  and I hope you can enact some of these ideas that you have [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6466.58s)]
*  because I think they're very, very promising [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6469.22s)]
*  and I think government needs people like you, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6471.4s)]
*  people from the outside. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6473.58s)]
*  I really do. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6474.9s)]
*  So thank you very much. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6475.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6476.58s)]
*  This was really an honor. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6477.4s)]
*  My pleasure, my honor. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-44tAVI7OEg&t=6478.46s)]
