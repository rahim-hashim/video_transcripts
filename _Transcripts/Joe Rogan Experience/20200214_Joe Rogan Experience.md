# Joe Rogan Experience #1427 - Melissa Chen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 14, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SLVjWbER4M)
*  What's up, Melissa? How are you? Hello, Joe. We were just talking about caning and hanging
*  in Singapore. Hanging now. Is that the new one? No, it's always been. That's how they
*  always do it. Caning is one of the forms of capital punishment, but they still, they actually
*  hang for drugs. What is Singapore like? I've never been. It seems like a strange place
*  because it's relatively wealthy, right? Yes, very much so. And upscale and very nice, but
*  also ruthless. But you know what happened in my generation? I've witnessed it go from
*  Third World to First World in my lifetime. Really? Yeah. Yeah. So it's one of those success
*  stories of nation building. But it's kind of like, you know those snow globes, the perfect
*  snow globes? Yeah. Yeah, when you turn it over and everything kind of sprinkles. That's
*  what it feels like living in Singapore. For me at least. I had to get out. It's just,
*  it's a bit sterile. It's perfect, but it's too perfect. It's almost like there's a, somebody
*  called it once Disneyland with the death penalty, which is a pretty good description. And you
*  get the death penalty for things like drugs, right? Just possession past like maybe 25
*  grams or 25 milligrams or something. Marijuana trafficking. So if you have an ounce of marijuana,
*  how many grams is in an ounce? What's the conversion? I don't know. I haven't converted
*  to. 20? Your system. 28. 28 grams in an ounce? So like an ounce is a good amount of weed,
*  but two ounces of weed, you're dead. Yep. Yeah. By hanging two ounces. Wow. That's,
*  that's weird. You can go down the street and buy that at a store. You have to show your
*  driver's license. So you're over 21 and you can buy that at a store and if Singapore,
*  they'll kill you for it. How many people have they killed for pot? I, I don't, I don't know
*  about that, but I do know like one time they actually executed a Australian citizen who
*  was on transit. So he didn't even get out of the airport. He was just kind of carrying the
*  drugs on transit. Wow. And they found him. Oh yeah. It was hanging. It's always hanging.
*  And what, what, do you remember what kind of drugs? Was he selling drugs? He was carrying
*  quite a bit. He was definitely trafficking it. Jesus Christ. They just hung them. Yep.
*  Zero, zero tolerance policy. Yeah, that's great. How did it go from third world to first
*  world so quickly? I guess the founder, you know, the country, well not the founder, the
*  founding prime minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew was probably one of the world's most famous modern
*  statesmen. He, he was resolute, like, you know, weeded out corruption. He was kind of like very,
*  very tight controls on free speech, but very much sort of neoliberal economic policies. So
*  tracked a lot of foreign investment, right? Because the highest income tax bracket is like
*  maybe 13%. That's very low. That's almost no welfare, at least in the sense of how we understand
*  welfare. But there's a lot of, it's a hybrid system. So there's, there's a lot of like zero capital
*  gains taxes, zero state taxes, very easy to set up a business. So he managed to attract a lot of
*  foreign businesses to set up their multinational corporation headquarters in Asia, because the
*  other alternative would be maybe China. But China would probably end up stealing all your,
*  you know, your, your, your corporate secrets, your intellectual property. But Singapore was billed as
*  this is the country that protects rule of law. Also English, he kind of made everybody speak
*  English with the working language. So if you want to do set up business in Asia, that was your place
*  to go. You got to like, you know, if you if you want to attract investment, you have to say like,
*  okay, what's in my what's in my region? And how can I be how can I have a competitive advantage?
*  So that was that was housing for really developing and, you know, just gained a lot of traction
*  as a state. The average American knows Singapore because that kid that got caned.
*  Now it's that stupid movie. Which movie? Crazy Rich Asians. Oh, Crazy Rich Asians. Right, right.
*  I never saw that. Was it good?
*  I didn't like it because I don't like romcoms. And like, come on, the premise is like, a girl is an
*  American Asian girl is like dating this guy from Singapore. He she doesn't know he's rich. And she
*  finds out on the plane there. It's like the most bullshit thing. It's just conspicuous consumption.
*  I mean, it's it's got some, you know, the city looks beautiful. And in fact, I kind of grew up
*  with some people that that live that lifestyle. But I just don't like that kind of movie. It's
*  it's it's a chick flick. A chick flick. You're not into chick flicks. Your Instagram is hilarious,
*  by the way. It's very, excuse me, Twitter, your Twitter. Okay. I get them confused sometimes.
*  Your Twitter feed is really good. It's both insightful, but also very funny.
*  Yeah, I try to play both sides. But the problem is like, you know, I think I think today there's a
*  bit of a if you're if you're a girl, and you're you're kind of funny, there's a bit of a sense
*  that like people are really taking that seriously. So I've been told to tone down on jokes. Who's
*  telling you that? Well, I'm also you know, I run a run a major nonprofit organization, and I tell
*  everybody what it is or keep it on the down low. No, it's a it's a really well, it's kind of right
*  up the alley. You know, it's it's a organization that that really tries to promote pluralistic
*  thinking. And you know, basically exporting ideas to the part of the world that it's often censored,
*  and you have narratives that are just not, you know, not exposed to people are not exposed to
*  the Middle East. So, you know, we thought, you know, we spent like, what, $8 trillion on the war on
*  terror? And what was the results? Right? Like, we marched in and said, like, okay, we're going to
*  bring freedom and democracy to people. But if there were no cultural institutions to kind of
*  nudge people to understand why they should value freedom and democracy, is it really a surprise that
*  it failed to take root there? So that's what you know, we basically work with organizations called
*  ideas beyond borders. And it's kind of self explanatory, you know, we basically take acquire
*  the rights to books that are not available there, translate them into Arabic for free. And then we
*  just like load it up on the library site. Anyone can basically access that download it. And we do
*  Wikipedia too. So like 10% of all Wikipedia is in Arabic, English Wikipedia. And so we basically try
*  to, you know, like, for example, George Orwell doesn't exist in Arabic. Right? So like, if you
*  look it up, would you even understand what the word or really means? Right? Yeah. So how did you
*  get involved in this? My co founder is Iraqi refugee and he grew up on the Saddam. And it's,
*  it's, I met him when I was in grad school. And I was really compelled by what he was talking about,
*  you know, just like, somebody who grew up in Singapore, too, we don't really have freedom of
*  speech. Right? So the issue was that like, for me, I just felt like growing up,
*  I was not I was kind of like, all right, you know, my issue is that like, there was no freedom of
*  thought, freedom of speech in Singapore, the government just kind of controls everything.
*  Sorry. My heart rate is like so high because I guess you've been drinking this stuff. Is that
*  what it is? Yeah, I was worried that you were nervous. So let's tell everybody what you're
*  drinking. Oh, my God, I'm sorry. It's called bang. How many do you have? This is my second one. You
*  ate eight pounds. The fuck are you doing? I don't. You're so tiny. This is so much. Are you gonna?
*  I know. I know. You're gonna be the first person to die on the show? No, no. Please don't. Sorry. I
*  mean, this stuff is like, yeah, a lot of caffeine. I'm fucking with it. Sorry, it was my second one.
*  I had like a really heavy workout. You can't have second ones of those. You probably weigh like 80
*  pounds. 105. Come on, stop lying. 105 pounds, yeah. No, I got muscle. You're a tiny person.
*  No, no, I got muscle. Right, but you're very small. That is a lot. It's also heating me up right now.
*  Sorry. Yeah. Your heart rate's pounding. It's kind of crazy. No, I know. I can feel it. It's like,
*  I can see words. What do they look like? What color are they? I don't know. Red. It's getting crazy.
*  Sorry. Sorry about that. Just take some deep breaths. Calm yourself down. I know. Did you drink
*  that to get pumped up for the show? This is my pre-workout. So when I did my morning workout,
*  I drank one and then I was like, you know what? I didn't really sleep that much last night,
*  so I might need another one. Oh my God. What a bad idea. Sorry. I've had people come in here that
*  are on Adderall and that's always the weirdest one because you just like, you gotta slow down. Like,
*  we're on different paces. Not you. I need a downer. I definitely need a downer. Want some pot? But
*  pot doesn't work on me. Oh, right. What kind of pot? I bet the pot we have will work on you.
*  Up to 50. I've done 55 milligrams edibles. That's ridiculously low. I do 200 every time
*  I go to the airport. Wait, 200 milligrams? Yes. Okay, but I'm like a quarter of a weight. Joey Diaz
*  takes a thousand. All right. Maybe I just haven't up my game yet. You can't say pot doesn't work on
*  you. Okay, but I so far have been unable to respond to THC. Really? Yeah. And smoking it or
*  eating it or both? Both. Jamie is with you with the eating. He's got some weird genetic disorder
*  that doesn't work with him. Like edible. He can take a thousand edibles and just hang around people.
*  Yeah, but that's a thing. Like people are immune. Some people are immune to THC. It does not.
*  Some people get withdrawals too. You know, I've talked to people that get actual physical
*  withdrawals from marijuana and I used to be really skeptical about that, but these are people
*  that I actually trust. And they're like, wow, I would, you know, when they would go on tour,
*  like if they have to go places and they didn't have pot, they would get literally, they'd get
*  shaky. They feel weird. And then they realize that, oh, this is my body's withdrawing from THC.
*  Apparently it's very rare, but common enough so that it's in the literature. They really,
*  they've documented people that have like a physical response to withdrawing from marijuana.
*  I mean, I'm looking forward to more research being done on this stuff anyway. Like, yeah,
*  we're headed there. But then Trump recently said something about trying to, I'm surprised.
*  He was comparing the way they handle drug dealers in China with a swift, fair trial. Yeah.
*  Was he saying Singapore? No, but that's how they do it in Singapore. Swift, fair trial and the
*  death penalty is what he said. Yeah. There's a resurgence of this in Asia. You see it in the
*  Philippines as well. So Duterte's has this extra judicial drug war that he's been launching.
*  So it's, I understand the concern with the plight. I understand that people are really worried that
*  people getting addicted to drugs ruin their lives. It devastates families, people dying of overdoses
*  from fentanyl and all these different hazards that are associated with drug use and drug dealing.
*  I understand that, but this sort of archaic way of handling it and death penalty talk in 2020.
*  I know. And one country completely decriminalized all drugs, right? Was it Portugal? Portugal. Yeah.
*  Yeah. And they had spectacular results. Low everything. Lower incidence of HIV infection,
*  lower drug addiction, lower overdoses, lower everything, lower crime. Right. I just don't,
*  it's just messy. It's not like if there was one thing you could do, like, Hey, if we do this thing,
*  then no one gets addicted to drugs and no one dies from overdoses. Well, then you do that thing. But
*  there is no legalization that no one would see overdose. They certainly would though. People
*  definitely will die of overdoses. If you make drugs legal across the board, the one thing that
*  you do that's good is you stop all the flow of money into illegal drug sales. Right. So all the
*  people that are selling drugs or most of it, at least all the cartel money, all that stuff goes away
*  because the cartels are making billions and billions of dollars selling to the United States
*  and other countries they can sell to. And they're doing it because it's illegal because it's a
*  business they can capitalize on that American businesses are not capitalizing on. And violence
*  goes down to them assuming. Right. Well, they have to. There's a correlate. I mean,
*  if you go back to what happened in the United States during prohibition, what it did is pop
*  up organized crime. It propped up organized crime in a pretty spectacular way. And it was because
*  there was a massive amount of money to be made selling alcohol. The desire for alcohol didn't
*  go away. The legality of it went away. Right. Right. So illegal sales went through the roof
*  and the people that were selling it were criminals. I just think it's part of the human
*  spirit, you know, that if you say you can't have something, yes, we'll just there's the old Arabic
*  proverb that which is prohibited is always wanted. Yeah. And whatever you kind of like,
*  you just drive it underground if you if you try to ban it. So it's the whole spirit of,
*  of punk rock of like, F you to the system. And that just lies in almost, you know, every human
*  heart. We actually see that with our books, for example, you know, a lot of books actually like
*  transmitted on these telegram groups in Arabic, books like that Sam Harris writes, you know,
*  Richard Dawkins, these kinds of ideas that are really super censored in the Middle East.
*  So you know, that's kind of the gap that we're trying to plug right now. It's that since books
*  are not available in that language, it's I think this is crazy statistic. More books are translated
*  between English and Spanish in one year than English and Arabic in 1000 years. Wow. It's
*  kind of crazy. That is kind of crazy. So the exposure to those ideas. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  Right. And the only other options get these people to learn English, which is far more difficult.
*  Of course, of course. And you know, your your average person living in Syrian refugee camp
*  isn't going to learn that quickly. Right. You got to meet people where they are. Right. So I think
*  the statistic when we first started 10% of English Wikipedia was actually in Arabic,
*  which means that every time like, for example, let's say you're like, Oh, Jamie, go Google this,
*  right. And, and, and you expect an answer. It's just, it's just at the tip of our fingertips. It's
*  so it's so baked into modern life. Now, we don't even like think twice about it. But imagine if
*  you live in, I don't know, say Saudi Arabia, and like, okay, let's just Google it 10 out of every 10
*  times. One time, there's no answer. Because the page doesn't exist. Or, you know, it just,
*  the word feminism doesn't exist in Arabic. So you can't look it up or secularism doesn't exist.
*  It's kind of it's how do you expect people to, to kind of break out of their of their mindset of
*  their indoctrination. You know, and it's not we're not saying like, this is a top down thing,
*  what you have to read this, it's that I just want to live in a world where being ignorant is choice
*  for everyone. Because because there's a choice for us. Like, let's say like, we know right now,
*  you're like, dumb and just, just like, basically, you spend your nights watching The Bachelor or
*  like, you know, whatever it is. It's like, I know, I do too. I do too. But I know I'm judging. But
*  let's listen, it's, they also are into interesting things. But I know some people do consume mindless
*  nonsense. My friend cam, but it does, I'm calling you out. Yeah, you know, you know, you watch that
*  shit. Which one the female on Bachelorette, he watches both of them. Oh, God. I only know
*  that's still going on because I'm at the checkout line and the supermarket like, why is that there?
*  It's so strange that people are even interested in that. I know. It's a weird thing. Very weird
*  thing. Yes, that ignorance would be a choice would be nice. Right. Yeah. So, so what you're
*  saying is that these part parts of the world, one of the problems of getting them to shift their
*  perception of the world is that they're not exposed to all the great works. They're not exposed to the
*  different ideas, different ideas and different different debates. And they have a monoculture.
*  So monoculture because of, you know, society is they have religions, they have ways of life that
*  are just so deeply entrenched. Right. And then you also have a really, really heavy censorship,
*  both from your authoritarian government and also from your religion. You know, the first word,
*  for example, the first word in the Quran is actually read. Really? But they really mean just
*  read this one thing. And, you know, just the sort of like habits of a free mind are not really
*  cultivated. And also when you're taught, I mean, growing up not to question things, and in part,
*  I understand because I think when you grew up in an Asian household with like, you know, tiger
*  parents, there's this sense of like, you don't question my authority, you know, so it permeates
*  culture from a very, very young age. And imagine like, if you kind of grow up in that environment,
*  you're going to internalize all those things. And that's why it kind of, you know, it follows you
*  over time. So when you were in school, you're taught no questions. It's just, it's not like
*  here where it is like, there's no such thing as a stupid question, Chad. There are in Asia,
*  like, there's definitely stupid questions over here, too. But you're told you're at least told
*  that we're giving Chad a break. Yeah. But I understand what you're saying. And that must be
*  really interesting for you to go from this one fairly restrictive environment to a fairly open
*  environment. Correct. And did that shift that happened in you and being exposed to all these
*  different ideas? Did that spark this desire to help other people sort of expand their ideas and
*  what they're exposed to? Yeah, because well, I felt like a fish out of water growing up in Singapore.
*  I was always the person that like, the teachers had to call like, you know, your daughter's asking
*  too many questions. She's disrupting the class. What kind of questions? I went to Sunday school,
*  too. I was like, I was that kid who was just like, you know, excuse me, but why, why do the
*  dinosaurs, why is it in the Bible that the dinosaurs and human beings walked, you know,
*  basically like days apart when like, we know from science that, you know, it was millions of years
*  and fossils. Did they get mad at you? Of course, of course. Yeah. No, they were like, just keep her
*  out of, we just rather her not come to Sunday school. Really? Yeah. Yeah. No, no answers.
*  There was no one that tried to like, sort it through and say, listen, must be that God was
*  testing people. And this is why. That's what my mom would say. Really? But in class, it's just,
*  you know, it's how there's no, there's no culture of dialectics of having dialogue and refining
*  your positions is that it comes from authority, right? This is a very Confucian culture. So it's
*  like, well, I am your teacher. So it is the way it is. Right. And, okay, that's one level of it.
*  And if you say, grew up in the Middle East, asking a question could be death. Right. If you,
*  if you even remotely like say in Saudi Arabia, especially remotely reveal that you might be
*  having atheistic thoughts, that's death. So it's like, we're talking about different scales and
*  degrees of censorship and consequences for that. And I think when I met my co-founder Faisal,
*  you know, I was like, okay, I guess I have, I had issues with the country I grew up in,
*  but for him, it was, he ended up almost being killed by Al Qaeda for just like starting a
*  blog talking about, you know, the importance of secularism and, and countering violent extremism.
*  Really? Yeah. That's how he came here as a refugee. So I'm like, oh shit, maybe there are,
*  you know, how did he almost get killed by Al Qaeda? Well, cause when, when the U S invaded
*  Baghdad and he was living in Baghdad at the time. And Al Qaeda took over his neighborhood once there
*  was a void. Saddam was ousted, right? And he was kind of like, you know, roaming around and like
*  telling kind of telling the U S army certain things like, okay, you know, like this is where
*  Al Qaeda is. This is the cell. My friend here has been like radicalized and Al Qaeda knew they put
*  him on a, on a hit list, you know, because he was not sympathetic to their cause. And so he ended up
*  on a death list. His brother was killed. Just horrible story. Bridget actually recently
*  interviewed him on, on her podcast. And, and I get the sense that like, oh shit, like the consequence
*  of saying what you think there is like, at least in my case, it was just like, Hey, maybe I might
*  go to jail in Singapore. Well, but in Iraq, it was death. I think it's hard for people in America
*  to really grasp what that environment must be like, because we're so accustomed to this
*  idea of freedom of speech. And it's so ingrained. Yes. It's so ingrained. Yeah. Rebels are
*  appreciated and tolerated here. You know, they're rewarded. Yeah. It's the whole Maverick thing. I
*  think, you know, as long as America still can celebrate Mavericks and tolerant, not just tolerate
*  them, but actually celebrate them. Yeah, we're, we're going to be fine. Right. Yeah. And hopefully,
*  hopefully the thing is that if it exists, the way it exists in other parts of the world,
*  it can exist like that here. Like the worst cases of human behavior, when you see,
*  you know, any form of dictatorship or control or propaganda or controlled by the state or by industry,
*  that stuff that you see in other countries is human beings in 2020. Right. I mean, our,
*  we would like to think that our constitution, the bill of rights and all of our ideals and what this
*  country was founded on is going to keep it from deteriorating like that. And most likely it will.
*  But the reality is those people in Iraq are human beings in 2020. And they're living in a completely
*  different way than we're living right now. At the same, on the same timeline, just things did not
*  go well there. And they're stuck in this horrible situation where they are controlled by these
*  religious fanatics and they are stuck and there's not a lot that they can do other than escape.
*  Right. And, you know, right now also, like with the rise of China, they're also, you know, starting
*  to use like basically some form of like electronic tyranny, right? They're able to, to really censor
*  the internet in a way that's been unprecedented. You can't access Facebook, Wikipedia, none of
*  it. None of these things that you and I can just like open on our apps can be accessed in China.
*  So the way they just like control information and now exporting those same tools to other
*  authoritarian countries around the world is that part to me is dangerous because, you know, I think
*  both Faisal and I came to America with this like, all right, this is the place that we can finally
*  be ourselves and think for ourselves. Right. Yeah. And we're starting to see that the whole
*  world seems to be kind of going in the other direction. Did, so there was a shift in China
*  and the shift was it was initially a completely communist society and now capitalism, at least in
*  a monetary sense, is embraced. Yeah. And so, yes. So there's this giant shift in what China actually
*  is, which corresponds to this huge growth. Is it possible that in the future, this shift could move
*  on to other aspects of Chinese culture, like discourse or the way they view the government
*  or even some form of democracy? That was what we expected. That's what we expected. That was the
*  theory. But, but the way China has behaved now, you know, they call it socialism with Chinese
*  characteristics. That's the official name of this long drawn game to, you know, institute
*  market reforms, usher in riches for the middle class, lift a lot of people out of poverty.
*  But in a very controlled way, in the way that's like, see, that's the thing about Asian culture,
*  people don't understand, it's that there's a fundamental difference between the China dream
*  and the American dream. Right. And Xi Jinping has outlined what he thinks is the China dream.
*  It's basically a top down way to, it's a goal, it's a national goal. And basically what they're
*  trying to say is that, okay, we're going to lift a lot of people out of poverty, but you have to,
*  your generation has to make sacrifices. It's not about the individual. It's about building a strong
*  China and implicitly also about, you know, ensuring that the CCP stays in power, the Chinese
*  Communist Party stays in power. But it's that you might have to give up, you know, personal
*  sacrifices for the sake of China versus the American dream is bottom up. It's about your
*  right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That's it. And if you do that,
*  that's the American dream. And if you achieve a certain level of happiness, if you achieve,
*  you know, it's all like, it's bottom up. It's not centralized and it's not something that the Chinese
*  government is kind of trying to stuff down your throat. And China's willing to play the long game.
*  So it is still a Leninist, Leninist Marxist government. Xi Jinping still believes in all
*  of that. That's why it's still so totalitarian. But it's, you know, they know that like the way
*  to gain power in the world is to get rich. And they did it on some, you know, on the backs of,
*  on the back of trade with other countries through very unfair practices, actually many cases.
*  So if you think about like how the, I think there's there are a lot of estimates of how much
*  they've actually stolen from the United States in terms of intellectual property, corporate,
*  corporate espionage, now even like academia is being infected. So how so he just arrested the
*  head of the chemistry department at Harvard. Oh, that's right. Yeah. But wasn't that they didn't
*  they think that that guy was in connection with some weaponized? What's the virus thing? Yeah,
*  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
*  that's thinking of something else. There was an article linking some Canadian researchers to
*  the virus. That's what I know. But this was this was different. The head of the chemistry department
*  in Harvard was found to have lied about receiving money from the Chinese government. So there's this
*  program called the thousand talents program in China. Basically, they're offering a lot of money.
*  The New York Times did a really good expose on this. They basically offer money to like academic
*  because you know, it's kind of sucks to be one here in the sense of like, you're not paid that
*  well. But China's dangling like a lot more money and say, okay, if you if you do research here in
*  China, there's going to be like less bureaucracy. So that's their way to lure these people in.
*  So he was hiding the fact that he was getting income from correct. How was he hiding it?
*  He just he didn't report it. Oh, and he put in the bank anyway. Right. And so at the end of the day,
*  when when you do when there's a relationship, they're trying to own to research.
*  Right. If you're researching something sensitive, that's a big issue. There was an article today,
*  where they've confirmed that Huawei has some sort of third party backdoor with a lot of their
*  electronics. There was a lot of speculation to why the United States was banning Huawei from the
*  major providers from because they were very close to releasing some and they have some amazing
*  phones. And they were really close to use them. Yeah, yeah, just on principle. In fact, like one
*  of my girlfriends, she's kind of sponsored by Huawei. She's European. Wanted to take a selfie
*  me and I was like, I am there's no way that my face could ever be, you know, in your phone.
*  Really? Absolutely. Tell me why. Like, what is what are your thoughts on it? Huawei is, is
*  really another just an apparatus of the main party, the government. And, you know, I really think that
*  Huawei is with respect to the next era of the digital world is the next Sputnik. Like it is
*  the Sputnik issue of our time. We should be doing everything we can to to to not allow Huawei to,
*  you know, have this big market share. And the person who started it was somebody that had a
*  lot of party connections to to the I think it was a general or something. And it's really they
*  really operate in a way that's very opaque. And, you know, anyone doing business in China will have
*  to have connections to the government, especially when you're that big. And because it's a government
*  that has such totalitarian control over everything, you can expect that that whatever information or
*  that they would have to answer to the government, whatever the government wants. If you're willing
*  to put your privacy in the hands of an entity like that, you know, go ahead. But know also that the
*  Chinese government has enacted all these mass surveillance policies. It's I just wouldn't trust.
*  I just wouldn't trust them. So what is different between Huawei and there's many Chinese manufacturers
*  of cell phones and Xiaomi? Yeah, it's it's the it's the government connection.
*  The only one that has that deep government connection. Well, the founder at least was
*  general that much I know. And just a lot of party connections. And, you know, just it's also heavily
*  subsidized by the government, which is one of the ways that China has been competing kind of unfairly
*  in global markets, right? When you have you can drive out innovation in the United States
*  by by making sure that your local version is so competitive on prices that they can't match you.
*  So in a way, it's like a form of economic warfare, which is one of the issues that Trump has really
*  pushed back on. It's the China trade issue. And he's been criticized by about that. Do you think
*  he's correct? On China? Yes. On China. Yes, I do think he's correct. He's been pushed back on.
*  It's interesting, because I think the Democrats were a lot more, you know, protectionist when
*  it came to trade, right? The Republicans and the libertarians always like free trade, free trade,
*  everything like, you know, let's globalize the world. What was the whole Thomas Friedman position
*  when he wrote about it in Lexus and the olive tree, that if we globalize the world that
*  economic that you're you lift a lot of people out of poverty, or your economic pie grows,
*  but your politics shrink. That was the idea, right? No two countries that have McDonald's
*  would fight a war or something like that. That was his theory. And in the case of China, obviously,
*  that didn't happen. Right? Like the part about the politics changing quote by a Tiananmen
*  protestor, he said, if the free world doesn't change China, China will change the free world.
*  Whoa. And if you think about what happened with the NBA,
*  you know, the whole Daryl Morey, explain that because that was shocking to me,
*  because the way they were capitulating to China, I was, you know, I was a little stunned,
*  because it was so open. Yeah. Can you explain what happened? So Daryl Morey, who was the GM of the
*  Houston Rockets, he tweeted out basically a little picture that that showed that he supported the
*  Hong Kong protesters. And the Hong Kong protesters have been at it since July of last year, 2019.
*  They have been protesting the incursion of Chinese control into their supposedly autonomous region,
*  China promised them that that would be two systems, one country, two systems after the
*  handover in 1997 from the British to China. They slowly kind of eroded that in many ways.
*  And their freedoms have been kind of, you know, diminishing over time. The straw, the straw that
*  broke the camel's back was actually this policy that they passed, this law they passed that said
*  that anyone can be extradited to China for trials, basically, was after a case that happened, the
*  criminal case. And the Hong Kong people knew that this law, if it goes into effect, basically gives
*  the Chinese government legal right to disappear or kidnap anyone and bring them for trial in some
*  sort of kangaroo or show trial in China. And that has happened. So booksellers, it's always the
*  booksellers in Hong Kong have been kidnapped because they were publishing these like insider
*  accounts, like dirty secrets of the, you know, the CCP whenever there was a leak, because the
*  Chinese Communist Party is huge, the Politburo is huge. And so there was a bookseller called
*  Causeway Books, and they were publishing all these like accounts from within the Chinese Communist
*  Party. And the owner of that bookshop one day just disappeared. And he ended up in China,
*  was basically a forced kidnapping. And he was released, I think he was, you know, he did his
*  jail time. And now he's setting up another bookshop in Taiwan. But that law, basically,
*  would just have allowed China to do that legally this time. So the Hong Kong youth were up in arms.
*  They, you know, they were tired of all the ways that their way of life had changed since the British
*  handed it over. And in a way, they were kind of pining for the good old times, the good old times,
*  and they were under a colonial, you know, an English colonial master, which was one of those
*  like moment for anyone on the left. And so Deremore tweeted this out. And of course, you know how big
*  the China market is for the NBA, right? Like all these players have contracts with them. In fact,
*  the Houston Rockets had a lot of contracts with the Chinese CCTV for broadcasts. They also had
*  merchandising opportunities, sneakers that were made there. And that caused a huge, huge outcry
*  in China. They were just like, oh, he's disrespecting us. And they were able to force him to basically
*  make a groveling tweet that said, oh, I'm sorry for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.
*  And then like all the other some NBA players actually came out and, you know, kind of took
*  the side of the Chinese government like, oh wait, who are we to, you know, they kind of like did
*  this backpedal thing when they're so strong on other forms of activism here. Like the NBA,
*  when it came to the North Carolina bathroom bill, you remember, like the transfer of bathroom bill,
*  they were always on the side of the woke. But then when it came to the China Hong Kong issue,
*  they stood with the biggest oppressor. Yeah, it's always hard when someone does side on the woke,
*  like what are you are you doing this because you think this? Or are you doing this because
*  you think it'll make people think more highly of you? If you do it. It's such a contrived thing
*  today. It's so difficult to figure out why people are acting the way they're acting. So when they
*  were acting in that way, it was so transparent. It was there was no ifs, ands or buts about it.
*  Like they were pressured. And they were worried about the money. They were worried about economic,
*  you know, whatever the fallout. Yeah, whatever fallout would happen. Right. It was really obvious.
*  It was like, Whoa, this is not like trans people using the bathroom. This is like you guys are
*  threatened. Right, exactly. Yeah. But the number of companies that have kowtow to China's, you know,
*  orthodoxy is there should be a list somebody should be keeping track of all of this.
*  There are companies like Marriott, even like luxury brands. So I think Versace or Dolce and
*  Gabbana got in trouble because I think on the website, they listed like countries that were in
*  and it was like they put Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. And China said, No, no, no, what are you
*  doing? This is all China. Right. If you don't change that website, you're not going to be allowed to
*  do business and everyone wants a share of the Chinese market. That's the problem. It's like the
*  biggest market in the world. Maybe India is bigger. But well, at least in the future, India will get
*  bigger. But everyone wants access to Chinese market. So they're able to use that as leverage
*  to basically bully companies, even movie execs to produce the content they want. So several,
*  I think World War Z was affected. You know, the other movie was Dr. Strange, the Marvel movie,
*  where the character played by Tilda Swinton was supposed to be a Tibetan monk. But you can't like
*  Tibet is this like hot bun issue for China, right? Like people have been fighting for
*  independence for a while, the Dalai Lama was exiled. So they changed the character. It wasn't a
*  Tibetan monk. It was this they changed it to a Celtic monk. And they made it to be a woman playing
*  the character instead to appease the Chinese government. So they they changed it in the
*  American version as well? Yeah. So that woman was American version is right, because the studios,
*  they're all going in on these deals with China. China is financing all these movies now.
*  Wow. So that woman in Dr. Strange was initially supposed to be a Tibetan monk.
*  A male. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. But they rewrote it to reflect the Celtic, Celtic female monk. Yeah.
*  Whoa. And then I think the recent the Top Gun, the movie that's coming out with Tom Cruise to
*  partially financed by China. And they have these like his jacket, people notice that there was a
*  patch that was like missing. And it turns out like that patch. It was like a for some reason,
*  China was just triggered by it. And it was gone. No, no, they just in the costume. Oh, this is it.
*  Yes. Yes. The problem was a Japanese flag. That's the Taiwanese flag. The red and blue. Yeah,
*  the USS Galveston. See, it's Wow. But but that that's what that's what makes it so scary that
*  they're able to pressure people to change their behavior from afar without no bullets. This is
*  just money, money. There's just access. Oh, I know. So many whores. That's why I think like one of the
*  solutions to this is to really like start. I know somebody should really start a website, maybe
*  it should be me. So just track all this stuff, all the companies that have our cowtow into China,
*  all the ones are standing the ground, you know, and so you can decide where to put your money.
*  So it's just a giant part of the market. That's the problem with these films. It's like it's
*  probably the Top Gun over in China. First of all, China invests, and then they sell those movies
*  over there. And there it's an enormous part of their overall budget, right? The largest,
*  the in terms of the box office, the outside of the United States, the second largest market is
*  China. The third one is Japan. And it's, it's like crazy, one fifth of China, basically. So it's not
*  nowhere, nowhere close. And you know, we're all driven by profits. It's capitalism. I think they
*  tried to get Quentin Tarantino to change his movie for China and told him to go pound sand. I think
*  so. I remember. Was it the once upon a time? Yeah, the new one. Yeah. Well done. Yeah. Well done.
*  It's a, it's weird that it's that easy. Just, just throw some money around and people change
*  their culture. Right. I mean, Google was developing a search engine for China. Yeah, they well,
*  I knew some people at Google while that was going on. And their, their position was if we don't do
*  this, they're going to copy our search engine and just steal all the intellectual property.
*  Or we can work with them and provide a censored version of Google. And I remember sitting there
*  going, this is almost like legalizing drugs. Like it's messy. There's no good way here. This is
*  they're both, they both suck. Like it sucks if they steal the intellectual copyright, if they,
*  they steal the ideas and create their own version of Google. It also sucks if Google goes over there
*  and self-censors. Right. And provides them with, you know, the ability to filter out information.
*  But I think also that if there's also an argument that if it was Google, at least maybe they have
*  one tentacle in China. And so therefore it might be able to change things or keep a pulse, you know,
*  have their pulse on something. There's the argument. Well, at least they blocked Huawei,
*  or I don't, it shouldn't say at least, but it's interesting that they blocked Huawei
*  from using all of their apps. So Huawei no longer has apps. They did have no longer have access to
*  the Google Play Store. So their new phones, they have to have their own apps. Yes. This is with the
*  the mate P, I think it's P 40. It's what it's called their newest, latest flagship phone. They
*  can't, they don't have access anymore. There's some, some apps you can side load from the web
*  and you can download them directly to your phone. But for the most part,
*  their access to the Google Play Store is completely shut off. So the thousands and thousands of apps
*  that feel like if you want, if you love a lot of people, apps are everything. It's not the phone
*  itself. It's the apps. If you don't have Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and you know, whatever the
*  you know, equivalents are in different countries, you're kind of shit out of luck.
*  But I think reciprocity is a good policy to abide by. Right? So like if China can influence us,
*  if you want, because the Chinese, they always use their market as like, we'll shut you out of our
*  market. If you don't do this, well, we should be doing the same. Right. Which I think is what Trump
*  had tried to do with the tariffs. We're going to shut you out of our market. We're going to penalize
*  you. Yeah. Unless you open up some things you've been, you know, there have been unfair trade
*  practices for a while. It's hard for us to understand what's really going on, because you
*  know, the news will show this anecdotal story of a farmer who's upset because this, you know,
*  he's losing money because it trumps tariffs. And then people go, Oh, tariffs bad. Right. You know,
*  I think it's a tough, a really comprehensive view of it. It's gonna take a lot of studying.
*  You're gonna have to dive deep and really try to understand the economics behind it all. And I
*  think most people aren't willing to do that. So we get sort of sold a narrative on the news.
*  I think the same thing happened with like, so called like, industries that were important to
*  national security, like steel, you know, those are things that we want to be careful how much we
*  actually do outsource to overseas because there might come a time when we'll need those, you know,
*  I mean, what happens if you globalize to the point that China's producing all your steel,
*  and then we have a war? And where's all steel going to come from? It's just so easy to be cut off.
*  He's really worried about a hot war.
*  We're definitely in the in a cold war right now with China, it feels. But, you know, China does
*  have military ambitions. I mean, their actions in the South China Sea have shown that they do
*  want to be at least militarily strong. They haven't, you know, to their credit, haven't taken any,
*  they didn't go into Hong Kong with tanks or anything, right? So no bloodshed on that account
*  yet. But it's one of those things also that in 2047, Hong Kong is going to return to China
*  fully anyway. So they're willing to Yeah, 2048 because the handover was only like four or 50
*  years before. This is just the transition. So the long game belongs to China. And they know that.
*  You know that?
*  This is not good.
*  It's not. It's not.
*  And there's no hope in your eyes of China eventually becoming what they hoped it would be
*  once capitalism was sort of introduced?
*  If people got information, if there were ways to resist the encroaching
*  tyranny, especially digital tyranny, right, in all forms. So it's not just mass surveillance,
*  all this AI stuff that they're sort of like collecting people's, like facial scans.
*  Yeah.
*  It's such a dystopian nightmare. It feels like it's like a science fiction film, frankly.
*  If I don't know, unless the revolution kind of comes from within and enough people woke up,
*  maybe it can be averted. But otherwise, we're just gonna, you know, it's gonna be headed to
*  it's this weird bipolar world, where there's a new axis and a new allies.
*  That sucks.
*  That will suck.
*  That sucks already. It sucks already if it's happening.
*  You've seen like Russia has taken the side of China, Pakistan has taken the side of China now.
*  So there is an alliance kind of forming. You can see it in, you know what happened with
*  the UN passed this resolution condemning China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang
*  and the signatories to that bill, that UN bill was basically the United States, New Zealand,
*  a lot of European powers, the so-called, you know, like these are countries that are often
*  accused of being Islamophobes because they won't accept Muslim refugees or that many Muslim refugees.
*  But you have Pakistan and even some, you know, majority of the Gulf countries
*  siding with China, defending China on their treatment with the Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
*  And it's one of those things that's just like, what? How is this happening? You know,
*  it doesn't make sense.
*  Does anybody have a roadmap of how they expect all this to play out? Because it seems that this
*  could be a real problem in the future. And most Americans up until this whole,
*  up until this trade issue with the Trump administration, most Americans didn't even
*  think about China. I don't know. I don't think I think Hong Kong was the thing that kind of lit,
*  you know, the whole barrel. To seeing the hundreds of thousands of people in the
*  streets every day, weeks after months.
*  Really young people too. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I think that the thing that has kind of like descended into police brutality,
*  like protests against police brutality now, but it's still going on. There's still, you know,
*  and then now with the whole coronavirus, you know, flaring up there, it's highlighting a
*  lot of issues with the Chinese government. Taiwan is another issue still. There are the
*  three T's you can't really talk about in China now. Tiananmen, Tibet, Taiwan. These are three
*  things that absolute, you know, no go, no go zones. Now, what year did you come over here? How old
*  were you? 17. 17. Yeah. What was the shift like going from Singapore to the United States? You
*  live in New York then? No, no, Boston. Boston. Your hometown, right? Yeah. Yeah. I lived in
*  Boston for 10 years. Really enjoyed it actually. It's cold as fuck. It, no, I like it. I don't
*  know. I'm a skier, so I really like it. But there was a huge culture shock. In a way, I knew what
*  signing up for, I chose America. Like it's actually easier for Singaporeans to plug and play
*  into any of the Commonwealth countries because it was a former British colony. So all your credits
*  would just transfer kind of more easily to a university in England, for example, Australia.
*  But I chose America precisely for the first amendment. It was very, it was a very strong
*  motivating factor for me. And also just the culture of, like we said, celebrating weird
*  people. Yes. Because I was weird. So I wanted to be in a place where I thought I would be accepted.
*  What made you weird? So Singapore is pretty conformist in terms of, you talk about monocultures.
*  There is a conformist drive. Like there is the right schools you go to, the right paths you take.
*  Very entrenched. And I really rebelled against that. Like, you know, Singapore chewing gum is
*  banned, right? Yeah. I haven't heard of it. Do you always bring chewing gum because it was banned in
*  Singapore? It's one of those things that's just like stuck in my mind. I had I grown up here,
*  I probably wouldn't be chewing this right now. It wouldn't just wouldn't matter.
*  But when somebody says I can't like, like, do not touch wet paint. I'm like,
*  yeah. This has always been a part of your personality from the time you were young.
*  Yes. It was kind of disagreeable. And was this nature or nurture? Don't know. I don't know. I
*  actually really, but so when you came to America when you're 17, you said, yeah, was that like,
*  yes, it was. But it was also, there were a lot of culture shocks that I had to adapt to.
*  You know, for starters, it definitely felt like a bit of a step back for me in terms of
*  how in terms of comfort of like standard of living, the United States was kind of a
*  third world country compared to Singapore. Really? Yeah. When I landed in Logan, and we were
*  taking that drive to, you know, like at the time I was going to be living in Cambridge,
*  we went by under these like highways. I'm like, it's rusting. This was kind of like,
*  just slightly before the big dig was done. And the infrastructure was kind of broken,
*  the potholes, your health care, what the hell is up with that? So it was a step back in material
*  comforts for me. And in Singapore, you know, if you grew up even middle class, like the 50th
*  percentile family can afford a domestic helper. So many Singaporean kids, in fact, 90% of all the
*  kids I know growing up, all grew up with needs. Wow. Picking up after them doing their laundry,
*  everything. So Singapore is no minimum wage. No minimum wage. And so if you measure employment
*  in that country, it's it's in some economic measurements, the way they do it, it's almost
*  like it's over employed. We don't have an unemployment problem. Everybody has a job,
*  pretty much no minimum wage. But what what how do people take be taken advantage? How are people
*  taking advantage because of that? Well, that's why we just are on average low in that in Singapore.
*  They're not that high. The United States practices what you call efficiency wages,
*  which is, you know, they kind of pay people a little bit more to to extract a better performance,
*  right? Incentives matter. Right. But in Singapore, that's not the case. But in Singapore,
*  the streets are taken care of better. Yes. Bridges. Oh, the government infrastructure.
*  You know, I tweeted maybe like last week saying something like, especially now we're in like
*  political debate season. I'm so tired of this whole left right argument like small government,
*  no big government, government's a problem, government solution. It's it's about effective
*  government. And I think that's something that the Singapore government had really perfected. It's
*  it's effective governance. It's not about the size we're gonna, I don't care whether this is a policy
*  that came from the right or the left. It's what works. People respond to incentives, right? And
*  if you want to encourage a certain kind of behavior, you there's carrots and sticks to
*  to basically encourage that behavior. And so it's there there are things that the government would
*  do in a way that just would never fly here. Where were you? You know, we treasure civil liberties too
*  much in a way, which I personally came here for that reason. But I'll give you a good example.
*  Social cohesion is engineered in Singapore. So there's it's very, very multicultural,
*  multi ethnic society. You have Malay Muslims, Indians, Hindus, Chinese who are Buddhists,
*  Christians and, you know, Caucasians all living in a in a on an island city state. That's about
*  five million in terms of population. And how the government manages this multicultural project is
*  that 80% of people actually live in public housing. That's very high. It's like a socialist thing,
*  right? Public housing that the government builds for you. And each block has to mimic the racial
*  demographics of the whole country. So you don't have ghettos, right? So you imagine like a housing
*  state that basically mirrors like, OK, if the total makeup of the country is 60% Chinese,
*  20% Malay Muslims, it has to follow. So you can't have basically an area like Birmingham in the UK
*  where all the Muslim immigrants or or, you know, something like Dearborn, Michigan or Minnesota
*  with all the Somali immigrants, you are forced to integrate. It's a it's a way to force people to
*  integrate and have, you know, neighbors that are just not not your own kind. And that's how they've
*  created this like, national identity that's very strong. That's interesting, because everybody
*  would want that, but they wouldn't want it engineered. Correct. You know what I'm saying?
*  Exactly. Everybody would love if the country, if all of our neighborhoods were integrated and
*  everybody just got along with everybody. I think I've always felt like that's one of the things
*  that New York has a large advantage over Los Angeles is interaction. People are constantly
*  on the subway and walking on the streets with everybody of all different classes, all different
*  backgrounds. And I think that's really good. I think it's good, too. Yeah, it's the contact
*  hypothesis. Right? Like, I feel like if kids grew up with, like you had a black friend growing up,
*  like, since you were, you know, three, four, you, you would never in your you would never think to
*  be racist. Like, it's just one of those things. It's like, early contact with different people.
*  And it's the same with that's what I feel about ideas to early contact with different ideas really
*  helps. And that's, that's, I don't know, I've kind of devoted my my life to to that cause almost.
*  Do you know Darryl Davis's? Yes, of course. I wrote about him. One of my articles. Yeah.
*  I was at that conference that that he was speaking at. We were speaking at the same
*  conference. And that's the conference that Darryl Davis was called neo Nazi. Did he talk about that?
*  Someone called him a neo Nazi? Yeah. Yeah. How did they, how? Because. Let me explain to people
*  who he is. If you didn't listen to the podcast that I did with him, Darryl Davis is a musician
*  and he was doing some shows at this country Western bar and met some people from the clan.
*  And through just communicating with them and being friendly with them over a period of many months,
*  he got them to quit. They quit the clan on their own. He didn't even request it. And then over the
*  course of several years, he's gotten more than 200 people to leave the clan, leave neo Nazi
*  organizations. And he, he, they give him their robes and their flags and he brought them all in
*  here. And he's a inspirational human being very much so, but he essentially was reinforcing what
*  you were saying that these people were never around anyone. Like one of the guys that he met
*  initially was saying, I've never had a drink with a black man before. And he's like, how's that
*  possible? And he's like, uh, I'm in the clan. And he's like, I've never, I've never had a drink
*  with a black man. And so he's like, this is the first time I've ever had a drink with a black man.
*  And we're like making this big deal out of it. And then eventually Darryl was going to his house and
*  eating dinner with them and hanging out with them. And then the guy's like, I can't do this anymore.
*  Like, why am I in the clan? And he quit and he quit just from Darryl being this really
*  friendly, articulate, brilliant guy who clearly didn't fit their narrative of what they thought
*  their racist depiction of what a black man is. Right, right. So the incident that happened was
*  this group called Mythicists Milwaukee had organized a conference. It was one of those-
*  What is it called? What? Mythicists. Mythicists?
*  Yeah. That was the name of the group, but they were kind of like a secular. So the mythicists
*  believed that Jesus Christ was eight, like he didn't really exist as a historical figure.
*  That's what a mythicist is. But in any case, it's a secular group that put on a conference.
*  And they've been doing that for years. And they had alongside people like Sargon of Akkad,
*  Count Dankula, the guy who taught his pug to do the salute. Yeah. So these people all came for
*  a conference and so was Darryl Davis. And it was a good- It was a bunch of people, but on the
*  political spectrum, basically. And it was about promoting discourse, civil dialogue, that kind of
*  thing. Andy Ngo was there as well. So basically, because when the conference was happening and
*  Tifa kind of found out about it, they started protesting the conference. They called the venue
*  to basically get it canceled. They said it was a neo-Nazi rally, clan rally. Ironically,
*  the greatest irony was that Darryl Davis was there and he got tainted as well. So I started
*  calling this the political one-drop rule, where it's like kind of what happened to you.
*  If you are associating or talking to somebody that- Or just a whole range of people, like
*  normal distribution of people, you will be tainted by the most right-wing person that you're in orbit
*  with. That's just how it goes. And that's what happened to Darryl. So when we had the afterparty
*  to the conference and Tifa was gathered outside the bar, the Pittman, New Jersey people- Because
*  Tim Poole was there too. The Pittman, New Jersey police had to station themselves outside of the
*  bar. And they were kind of protecting this event. It's ridiculous because
*  yes, you might find Sargen's politics objectionable, but why is everybody who's associated
*  with the conference also lumped in with this? And why is the response that this needs police
*  protection? We're just talking about it. It doesn't make any sense.
*  No, this desire to shut down speech is very dangerous. It's very stupid. It's childish.
*  And it's this thing that it gets- It just gets reinforced in that culture, the culture of either
*  Antifa or people that support Antifa. They don't understand the consequences of shutting down
*  speech. You think that you're just going to shut down speech and deplatform people that have
*  marginally offensive views. And the problem with that is, first of all, you close the door for them
*  to be influenced in a positive way or for other people to learn from them being influenced in a
*  positive way. And second of all, the way to shut down ideas is not stop the person from talking.
*  It's to combat those ideas with better ideas. And then everyone around them gets to see the
*  discourse. When you have these debates online and people discuss these things online, it
*  benefits millions of people. When you shut that down, it benefits nobody but your cause. And your
*  cause is probably incorrect. Your ideas are probably wrong. In the case of Daryl Davis,
*  you're definitely wrong. He's not a Nazi. So if you're shutting that down and say,
*  these people are Nazis, well, you're wrong. And you're censoring people that are trying to get to
*  the bottom of things. And getting to the bottom of things, I mean, discussing things and trying to
*  figure out tenable solutions or comfortable middle ground, that takes forever. This is not like,
*  you know, you have Christina Hoff Sommers and she has this discussion and they pull fire alarms and
*  yell that she's a Nazi. Like she's a feminist. You guys are crazy. Everyone has to comply
*  with woke ideology 100% with no deviance whatsoever. And everyone has to take an impossible
*  to pass purity test. This is a dumb way to communicate. But you ever notice something,
*  too? Why is the concern always that if we have this battle of ideas, that the person would shift
*  to the right? Why are you not concerned about the other way? It reminds me of, because I grew up
*  pretty evangelical, my mom was very religious. It was that she tried to, it's that, okay, if you're
*  a good Christian, you might get corrupted by bad ideas. So we have to ban, I don't know,
*  Harry Potter books are banned in my household. It's a way to ban all these because it encouraged
*  witchcraft. So I wasn't allowed to celebrate Halloween. It encouraged witchcraft. Wow,
*  that's heavy. Yeah, it's pagan stuff. It's satanic. But that's what I mean. This is like,
*  this is satanic. This is evil. And it has taken on this religious dimension, this liturgical
*  dimension, because they're always so concerned that the corruption is just going, like they're
*  going to drift to the right. Of course. They're never concerned that somebody might be convinced
*  by the arguments and go to the left. Why? I don't get that. Well, the drifting to the left, first of
*  all, they think would be a good thing. The problem is- But why don't they think it would happen?
*  Well, they don't worry about it. They're not worried that someone would drift to the left.
*  You mean by looking at someone's offensive views and that they would be more likely to drift to
*  the left? Is that what you mean? That like, okay, it's like, let's say we expose everybody to
*  all ideas. Right. Why are we so concerned that the individual that they're, you know, the target,
*  I guess, would be shifted right and not shifted left? Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah. If
*  there's an equal- I think they have an infantile perspective on ideas. And they're worried about
*  people being indoctrinated. They're worried about- but they're not worried. Look, if you have someone
*  talking and this person is preaching some ridiculous thing and someone starts becoming
*  indoctrinated and gravitates towards that, the real problem is that these people that are being
*  indoctrinated are gullible and they're foolish. That's the real problem. And in your eyes,
*  they're going in the incorrect way. So it's infantilizing. Yes. It's actually patronizing.
*  It is patronizing. Yes. I think that's what I couldn't stand about. Those people are dumber
*  than you. You're smarter. You know better. You need to stop these people from being tricked
*  into this right-wing ideology. I mean, I've heard intelligent people make this conversation about
*  other intelligent people that disagree with them, like Ben Shapiro, that like Ben Shapiro should be
*  deplatformed because Ben Shapiro is indoctrinating people towards right-wing ideology by having these
*  salient points and articulate sentences and these rants that he goes on. He speaks very fast. He's
*  got a great grasp of the English language and it's very compelling. And the idea is that he's
*  indoctrinating young people. Well, no, he's speaking with passion. I don't agree with him on a lot of
*  things, but I certainly agree with his right to express himself. And he's not convincing me.
*  Who is he convincing? Like when he talks, when Ben Shapiro, here's an area where we deeply disagree,
*  gay people. He thinks it's immoral. He thinks he would never go to a gay person's wedding.
*  He wouldn't even go to the celebration after party of a gay wedding. And I'm like, well, this is
*  all for religious reasons. I'm like, that, I think that's ridiculous. That's not convincing me.
*  So who is it convincing? Is it convincing someone that's a baby? Are you dealing with children? Are
*  we dealing with uneducated people? Are we dealing with people that don't have positive influences?
*  What's wrong with letting him express these ideas? These ideas are hot. I mean, he and I had like a
*  long conversation about it on the podcast where I was like, I think it's ridiculous. Like, what do
*  you care? My perspective is what do you care? And his perspective is he couldn't support that
*  because of religious reasons. So then we go deep into the hole with why. And what are these
*  religious reasons? Like how deep do you go with this? Do you think Jesus came back from the dead?
*  Like he doesn't, he's Jewish. It's a different perspective. But do you think, you know,
*  do you really think that God thinks that homosexuality is some sort of a carnal sin
*  and terrible? If so, God made everything. Why did he make homosexuals? Please explain that.
*  What kind of a weirdo is God? That he gives people this urge to be gay, but then he tells them,
*  fight that urge. And then he makes this comparison to that's like murder. Sometimes you want to murder
*  people. Okay. I think that's different because you don't want to murder people all day every day.
*  I know a lot of gay dudes who want to fuck dudes all the time. It's like, it's God did a crazy thing
*  to their system. And for you to believe in God, but have a problem with that to me is ridiculous.
*  So now we're banking on these really ancient words that were written by people with no grasp
*  of science, no understanding of biology, no understanding of the culture of the world,
*  no understanding of the sheer number of these people and taking into perspective that, you know,
*  you're literally dealing with, I don't know what percentage of the population is gay, but it's a
*  significant percentage. So you're saying all of them are frying in hell. Do you know how dumb that
*  is? That's really fucking dumb. Like if they're your neighbors and they're just happy and loving,
*  what do you care? The goal should be a cohesive society where people are comfortable being around
*  each other with all their differences and just nice people, just nice to each other. Exactly.
*  It doesn't matter if you're gay or straight or trans or black or white or Asian or fucking
*  whatever. It doesn't, it shouldn't matter. The individual should matter and the way we interact
*  with each other, that should matter. And we have to take into consideration that if you're going to
*  live your life by these things that were written down thousands of years ago, before people had any
*  of these understandings of all the subtle nuances of humanity and all the differences that people
*  have and, and, and now the biological understands of why they have these differences. Well, you're
*  dealing with ignorance. You're, you're, you're, you're applying these ancient ignorant rules
*  to a modern world where we have a vastly expanded understanding of human beings. Right. But to Ben's
*  credit, I mean, he's friends with Dave. He doesn't let that- Sort of, but he wouldn't go to his wedding.
*  Yeah, but he says he's gonna- I cut him off. If I invited him to my wedding, he's like,
*  I can't, you're a sinner. I'm like, fuck off. But you know what? A lot of us who have parents who are
*  super Christian, like I understand, like my, my, at the end of the day, you know where that's coming
*  from? She, my sister is gay. And, and at first she didn't, she didn't accept that. And the reason
*  for that was that it was coming from a good place. Like for her, it was, I don't want my daughter to
*  go to hell. So it's like, it's like, it's again, the road to hell is paved with good intentions,
*  right? And so, so the only reason she was objecting to it was because of this belief
*  that she's going to end up burning in hell. So it's coming from ironically a place of love.
*  It's judgy, yes. And it's based on Bronze Age ideology. But, but you know, I don't think that,
*  that either of us ever doubted that she loved her. And it's, so I kind of understand where Ben comes
*  from in that sense, even though I, I, you know, it makes me angry. Like I, you know, reject all
*  that stuff. It's just silly. And it, what's interesting is he's so smart. And when he talks
*  about that, it's all of a sudden you see stammering and he gets weird because he knows it's nonsense.
*  But he's such- I don't know if he knows that. He's got to know. He's got to know. He's just deep. He's
*  just balls deep in his religion. Which is, I like the guy a lot. I really do. And I've gotten so much
*  shit for saying that I like the guy. But we need more of that. We need more of the hate, the, you
*  know, hate the sin, not the sinner. And practice on both sides. But I think he and I only have,
*  we disagree on some issues and some political issues, but he's a decent person. He's a nice
*  person. He's very friendly. He's funny. I enjoy his company a lot. I like Ben Shapiro. I really do.
*  I think he's a brilliant guy. I mean, the gay thing's the biggest one. Cause to me,
*  that's the dumbest one. Like my, my, my, it always comes back to why do you care? That's all it is
*  to me. Like, why do you care? I don't care. Like, why do you care if someone's gay? Like if it, if
*  does it affect you? How can it, how can it affect you? Are you, do you have your fingers in
*  everybody's business? Like it's crazy. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, that was
*  the argument against a gay marriage. Like why does it affect your heterosexual marriage? Exactly. It
*  shouldn't. Well, the sanctity of marriage. It's so dumb. The sanctity of marriage. How about Vegas?
*  You could go to a fucking drive-through. You can get married at a drive-through movie theater. I
*  mean, that's really what it's like. Right. Exactly. You get married anywhere. That's so dumb. So,
*  it's so ridiculous. I just, I feel like at this stage of civilization, there's the, we have to
*  figure out what stuff we're going to abandon from the old days and what stuff we're going to keep.
*  And we've already abandoned a lot of things, right? In Christianity, if you leave, they don't kill
*  you anymore. You know, we're not, they got rid of some of the things during the Enlightenment.
*  Exactly. Yeah. They changed a lot of the aspects of Christianity that we associate today with more
*  repressive religions. Exactly. Yeah. That used to be Christianity. Yeah. I'm a huge fan of the
*  Enlightenment in general. In fact, the, you know, Steven Pinker wrote that book, Enlightenment Now.
*  That was the first book we chose to translate into Arabic. And then it became the, like recently,
*  there were a lot of protests in the Middle East. And we started distributing that book. Like it
*  was actually some, the person was coordinating some of the protests that was telling us,
*  we want to give this book out to the people because a lot of these youth, like they're really
*  jaded by theocrats in the region, by authoritarianism. And they're like, you know what?
*  You know what? Our religion had never gone through, not the Reformation. We don't want
*  the Reformation. We want the Enlightenment. Because Enlightenment was what constrained Christianity in
*  a way. Yes. And it really, if you looked at, one of the greatest intellectual achievements of Europe
*  came out of there, right? This idea of the social contract, of eroding monarchy, absolute monarchy,
*  separating church and state, all these wonderful innovations and ideas came out of the Enlightenment.
*  And it was, you know, promoted this idea that like maybe people should be free to have their
*  own conscience and think differently. And that's something that really, really is needed in the
*  Middle East. Well, I think the way that your organization is going about it is probably the
*  best way to get books translated, get ideas translated to people that maybe didn't, weren't
*  ever exposed to these concepts before. Right. And maybe that'll help. Yeah. It's just. But that's
*  the thing. So, you know, pluralism, I see that as, you know, that's what we're doing, promoting
*  pluralism, this idea that you can have all these competing narratives. And so you asked me what my
*  culture, you know, like when I came to America, like how, what was my experience just moving here?
*  Yes, was very freeing and liberating because I felt like I went to a place that was pluralistic,
*  that tolerated all the weirdos. And then maybe in like 2014, you know, things started to change,
*  at least on campus, when, you know, pluralism wasn't tolerated. You started to see the rise of
*  this sort of more intolerant, you have to, you know, kind of kowtow to this intersectionality
*  and critical race theory. So that was an interesting experience and I think was ultimately
*  very detrimental to the actual project of liberalism. It's counter, it's, you know, working
*  against that. Exactly. Yeah, that's the really frustrating part of it. Like what you're claiming
*  to be preaching, your ideology is actually working against it ultimately behind the scenes and you
*  just can't seem to see the pattern where it's going. You can't stop people from discussing
*  things and say that you support free speech. That's not free speech. You know, and one of my
*  favorite things with Ben, with Ben Shapiro is watching him talk to those people. He is one of
*  the best at taking questions and just decimating these social justice warriors. Go and watch Ben
*  Shapiro destroy. I know I like that. I know, but I just hate the way the captions. Well,
*  the captions are terrible. It's very click baity and it's not him. He doesn't make those captions.
*  It's his supporters, but goddamn, is he good at it? I secretly laugh at it. I know it's kind of
*  bad for discourse. I do it right out, right out in the open. He's great at it because he's, you know,
*  he's logical and very intelligent. So when these kids are saying these things that, you know,
*  they just learned last month in their gender studies class and they're yelling at him and he
*  breaks it down. It's just one of my favorite things. But those kind of discussions are important.
*  First of all, so that these kids realize that, Hey, there is this brilliant right wing guy that
*  can decimate your argument really quickly. He talks quickly too. Yeah. You know, he'll smash
*  your argument. He's very smart. And so you need to know that your argument sucks. It's like having
*  bad Kung Fu. You know, you're running around the world thinking you're going to kick everybody's
*  ass because you've never really been tested. And everybody who you're training with says your
*  Kung Fu is amazing. And then you go into a gym where someone doesn't believe in your Kung Fu and
*  fucks you up and you go, damn, that's important. I needed to know. That's one of the culture shock
*  things for me when I first moved to America. It was that, you know, I think a lot of American kids
*  were told like participation trophy culture. A lot of them were told that they were the best,
*  like, you know, like Tommy, like you are, you know, there's nothing you can do. Yeah. You're
*  just like so amazing. And I'm like, do these people, it's like American Idol, you know,
*  we used to get the seasons in Singapore too. And it's like, these people can't sing. And that's
*  actually why they're putting them on. They're awful. Yeah. And nobody told them, like, are you
*  telling me that like they've been telling their friends, Oh, I'm practicing going on American Idol.
*  Did nobody tell them that, bro, like you should just be singing the shower. Nobody told them.
*  There's a couple of things going on. First of all, some of those people are trolls. They're
*  going on that they know they suck and they're going on because they're going to get on TV.
*  And the best way to get on TV is actually to suck. But okay, there's no, there's no concept of shame.
*  Like they want to do it. They want to be on TV. Look, I used to host fear factor. Don't talk to
*  me about shame. Okay. I understand. There's no shame in that. There's no shame in attempting to eat
*  bull testicles. Actually, I think that's heroic. That's definitely not heroic. And it's now a show
*  on Food Network, right? Well, bull testicles are actually a common food. Yeah. Rocky Mountain
*  oysters. They don't taste bad. Bull testicles does not taste bad. They're actually the way they cook
*  them. They cook them well. They're actually delicious. Okay. But there's on there's, there's
*  no shame in doing something that most people are fearful about. The singing thing, what's going on
*  is first of all, there's a lot of those people that are mentally ill. That's part of the problem.
*  A lot of those people are delusional. They're mentally ill. They have like legitimate mental
*  health issues. And then they go and sing and they sound terrible and no one tells them because
*  they don't have any friends. So one of the reasons why I think, I think there's a happy medium. See,
*  the thing is, you know, if you grew up in Asia, you're told that you're just a dumb ass all the
*  time and you're kind of kind of constantly beat down. You know, if you come home with like 99
*  over a hundred for your math exam, your parents are not going to say Pat, Pat, well done. You're,
*  they're going to say, where was that one point? What did you do wrong? And again, you do not doubt
*  that they love you and care for you. That's just how it is. And so you kind of internalize that and
*  have very low self-esteem and you know, in general, like, but you kind of know your limitations,
*  right? That's the problem. Like when I, when I moved here was that I realized like a lot of
*  the kids I went to school with, man, I wish they had that confidence. You know, it's like they are,
*  their inflated sense of self-worth was, was just so big, but sometimes it allowed them to get the
*  good jobs. It allowed them to ace the interview. They don't have to do stupid things like drink
*  this and get nervous. You don't have to do that either. I grew up around a lot of Koreans because
*  I did Taekwondo from the time I was young. I did two for a while. And they are, I mean, I,
*  I thought I knew what hard work was until I was around these people. And I was like, oh my God,
*  I work. Yeah. Koreans. And my friend Junkic, who was on the U S national team when I was
*  younger was in medical school. So he's going through his residency and training to be on
*  the national team. So while he was studying, he would put his backpack on, fill his backpack
*  up with books and run up the stairs of the university, run up and down the stairs to get
*  some additional workouts in. He was trying to train for the U S team while he was doing his
*  residency. That's insane. He was crazy. He would sleep three hours a night and he was like one of
*  the best Taekwondo fighters in the world. And, uh, it was all through sheer will and determined,
*  but he was explaining that to me about what it was like growing up is like, you are never good,
*  never, never, nothing that we're good enough, you know, no matter what you do, you could have done
*  better. You can work harder. You could always do more. Yeah. No, I mean, it's, it's unforgiving,
*  but it's one of those things that it's a good illusion. It's, it's, I think a very healthy
*  illusion to have that like work equals success. Right. And, and that's why I think, you know,
*  people of Asian descent generally are pretty primed to, to, to buy into the Republican politics,
*  right? Of, of pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You don't need handouts. The harder you work,
*  the more likely you're going to achieve something. Um, that's why there's just such a natural,
*  you know, ally in terms of the, as a big to rely on this group block as a political group.
*  Well, that's the undiscussed racism in academics is the way Asian people are treated when they're
*  applying for major universities, particularly for Harvard. Like they, they literally,
*  you have to score higher if you're Asian because there's so many Asian people that get in,
*  they made it more difficult. Yeah. Which is right. Yeah. I mean,
*  it's not a meritocracy anymore. Like you've, you've decided that they have to do better.
*  Right. Then white people, they have to do better than everybody else, which is crazy.
*  I think the insidious thing in particular, the Harvard case was that they started downgrading
*  Asians on personality. I mean, that's the part it's like, okay, fine. You, you want to say that
*  like, maybe, you know, we don't want, uh, we won't want to like lower the scores a little for other
*  groups and, and, you know, but then to downgrade this personality, that's the part that, that
*  bothered me. How did they do a downgrade personality? What was, what was the method
*  that they used to do that? So they said, okay, we're not just going to rely on standardized tests
*  because that's the thing. Like standardized tests, you know, they, they're, they, they,
*  the, they can be easily gamed. That was the idea that like, you can just go for more tuition,
*  extra classes, and you will do well. Well, we care about the holistic, uh, package of the applicant.
*  So you want to see more personality. Ultimately, this was about, you know, like what Aristotle
*  called the telos, right? What is the telos of higher education? What's the ultimate goal or
*  essence of higher education? Is it to just produce perfect cogs in the machine of the global economy?
*  Or is it, you know, to produce, uh, engage citizens or whatever it is, right? Like, so however you
*  define that question, what's the purpose of higher education, you could tailor your, um, entrance
*  methods to meet that. And in Harvard's case, they decided, well, you know, we're going to,
*  instead of just looking at, uh, your GPA, your, um, essay, we want to see, want to interview the
*  person. I want to see what your personality is like. Can you thrive at Harvard? Are you going
*  to be a good contributing member of, of this university? Yeah, exactly. And you know, this is
*  one of the areas in which consistently you look like the Asian population that was applying to,
*  to Harvard was downgraded in that score. They scored really high when it came to like
*  extracurriculars, academics, they were so strong on, on SATs and, and, you know, all these other
*  standardized tests. But when it came to personality, they were very consistently downgraded.
*  So do you think that that characteristic, like the seeking out that was, that was applied
*  specifically to try to limit the amount of Asian people? Cause that's the argument, right?
*  Um, you know, I don't know if it was done specifically for that, but I think Harvard has,
*  again, monocultures suck in general. So, you know, if you're going to, even for me, like I was coming
*  to study in America, like 10,000 miles away, right? From the place I grew up. I don't really
*  want to go to school with a lot of Asians because like, I could have just stayed there, frankly,
*  but I was looking for, for, for something that wasn't a monoculture. You have to just expand
*  your mind. Right. So any other day, the issue with Harvard is that it was taking federal money
*  and if you see Harvard as a stepping stone to a career, to a future, it is unfair. It is kind of
*  unfair if they were penalizing you based on race. That's the hard part of proof, whether or not this
*  was personality or race or some sort of, you know, other thing that they were selecting for that
*  happened to correlate with race. That's the part that that's hard to prove. So is it possible that
*  they were just trying to enhance the way people communicate on campus? And so they sort of
*  emphasized personality and emphasize social interactions and in doing so, they penalized
*  Asians without being aware of it? Yeah, kind of. I mean, to be, to be honest, like, you know, when
*  I was in college, I only did my first jello shot like a couple of weeks ago and couple weeks ago
*  now. Yes. Okay. Well, I was that typical, you don't need to do jello shots to be in college.
*  I don't know if anything. Okay. No, okay. Not that, but I didn't, I didn't have the typical college
*  experience. You didn't party? I didn't party. And I think a lot of, you know, a lot of international
*  students who come from Asia will probably fall into the same habits. Like, we're kind of like,
*  you know, we've been told that there's only one way to succeed, work hard and summa cum laude and
*  all these things. So a lot of us kind of are culturally aligned on that. And, you know,
*  do we contribute to campus in the same way that your active student union leader would, who's
*  involved in other curriculars? I don't, you know, I don't know. So would Harvard want a diversity of
*  behaviors and interests? Yeah. Probably yes. You know, you don't want all these like boring STEM
*  people walking around. But you want all kinds of different stuff. And you also want people that
*  raise the bar really high in terms of performance. You do. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's, that,
*  that enhances other people's understanding of what's possible. But as a private institution,
*  you can, you can make your student population up the way you want, right? That's why you have
*  what Liberty University, which is Jerry Falwell's, and it's for Christians, but it's a private
*  institution. They're not taking money from the government. So that's fine. Unlike UC Berkeley
*  state institution, they abolish affirmative action. UCLA, all the UCs did. Look at the
*  population 70 80% Asian. Interesting. In California. Yeah. Why is that?
*  This is the uncomfortable, you know, this is the part where we just, you know, like, I don't want
*  to, I don't want to say to you, I don't know, because they kick ass. They work harder. Yeah.
*  They're more dedicated, more disciplined. People are very uncomfortable to talk about
*  differences in group outcome, because we have to kind of make everybody the same or else there
*  must be some sort of systematic thing. But I think that Asians because they're so hard working
*  and because they don't complain, this they get people get away with this stuff, where they get
*  away with discrimination against them. I think they're starting to complain. That's why the
*  lawsuits were filed. So they are starting to, but it's like it took that to like, all right, you
*  fucks. And there's actually quite a big pro Trump, Asian American voting bloc. You know,
*  this, this, this particular issue of affirmative action is really driven a lot of Asians rightward
*  in New York City that has happened to under the blagio. Really? Yeah. Because of the public
*  school situation there. What's what is the same thing they want to lower, you know,
*  basically in terms of the public high schools, they want to institute the same policies
*  for affirmative action. So that's, that's becoming an issue. I think I read an article recently that
*  Andrew Yang was kind of dragging Asian Americans back to, you know, to the left, but I don't know,
*  remains to be seen. He just dropped out. So yeah, now that he's out, I wonder what's going to happen.
*  Yeah, I was bummed about that. He was my guy. He has some really interesting ideas. And he's so,
*  he's so open minded. You know, his, his perspectives are so uniquely non-politician. Yeah.
*  And like how refreshing to finally have somebody who's scientifically and technologically literate
*  in government. Yes. That was really my big attraction to, I know it was the basic bitch
*  intellectual dark web choice, either him or Tulsi was, but I really, really liked him.
*  Yeah. This whole thing is so strange. It looks like they're trying to fuck Bernie over again,
*  just like they did in 2016. They're just that we, we watched that coin flip over and over again
*  yesterday from Iowa. We were like, arrest that kid, put him in jail. That was a, that was an
*  illegal coin flip. That was a terrible coin flip. The whole thing is just so weird. It's just,
*  seeing it play out and seeing it play out so transparently, so many,
*  some of the conspiracies are like about, cause now they're, they're kind of like pitting Mayor
*  Pete against Bernie. Right. And he's talking shit about Bernie. He has to, and he get booed
*  yesterday, right? And then Bernie was talking about how many billionaires,
*  so many billionaires donate to Mayor Pete. That was pretty good. Bernie. It's not that good.
*  Andrew Yang, 2020 dropout fuel speculation on NYC. Oh, mayor of NYC. Holy shit. He could do that.
*  He could win that. Fuck. Yeah. Actually he would. How's Mayor Pete? Is he still a mayor? Yeah. Yes.
*  How do you do that? That's a bit of a complaint. That should be a giant complaint. Did he do a great
*  job as a mayor? And he's like the bet. Did he clean up all the problems of that city? He's,
*  he's done enough to make people notice, but I think the African-American community is not happy
*  about some issues that he talks really well and he's handsome and he's a veteran. Those are good
*  things. They're like fucking run them, run them, run them. But you know, people are really raking
*  him over the coals for apparently like his, you know, again, he's checked all the right boxes,
*  Harvard, McKinsey, like he's too perfect. Like he was 3d printed in the DNC headquarters, you know?
*  Yes. So people are very concerned about that. Like it's so funny how like this whole optics and
*  authenticity really, for me, that's why I like Andrew Yang. He was, if you hate politicians,
*  which I generally do, he's the least hard to hate. Yes. He's the one talking to him. He's so normal.
*  He's like a guy who runs some tech company or something. That's what he feels like when I talk
*  to him. Yeah. Yeah. And we, that's the thing, like, you know, with 24 hour exposure, social media,
*  news cycle, this kind of signal is so obvious in a way that was never before, right? We can see
*  normal people now. Yes. And we know the difference between grandstanding posturing
*  and just like being normal person. Yeah. So I mean, I just, but also normal people don't want to do it.
*  Yeah. It's like the whole thing of it is just so invasive. Right. It's disqualify anybody who
*  wanted to do it. Exactly. But you know, this is a system we have got to do what we got to do. It's
*  better than China, right? Of course. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. As dirty as it is over
*  here, it's still better than the alternatives that we see elsewhere around the world. Right. Exactly.
*  I'm hoping things just continue to get better. I'm hoping more, you know, more people understand
*  the mechanisms behind the scenes and how all this stuff works. And I have a question for you,
*  though. What do you, cause like, you know, you do talk a lot about like woke stuff kind of going
*  amok, right? Does it not bother you though, Bernie, that he aligns himself with some characters who
*  are super woke? I think woke activists in particular. Yeah. Well, I mean, he also aligns
*  himself with people at Cornell West who is brilliant and has some amazing ideas about that.
*  And like looks at it from an accurate and educated perspective. I think a lot of the, the wokeness
*  is a sign of a cultural shift in the right direction. Less racism, less homophobia,
*  less fill in the blank, all those, all the things that we, that trouble us about like evil behavior
*  and even greed, corporate greed, all these, these things that trouble us about the influence that
*  money has on politics and Bernie clearly stands against all that stuff. And I think that when
*  you see these, this woke stuff, even though it goes amok, you have to look at it on a spectrum.
*  It's like the crazy Antifa people who demand a hundred percent compliance with woke ideology,
*  or they'll hit you in the head with a bike lock versus people who want single mothers to be able
*  to have free education and free healthcare and give them the economic support that they have to
*  raise their family and hopefully give their children a chance at achieving a successful,
*  comfortable life in this world versus suppress them versus keep them in this fucked up system
*  that just throws them in the meat grinder with everybody else. Treat this country like a community,
*  like try to do our best to help the people that are in a disenfranchised position because there's
*  so many, try to do our best to in some way economically uplift all these deeply impoverished
*  sections of our country. Those are the good aspects of woke ideology. See all woke ideology
*  isn't just the, you need 78 different gender pronouns and you have to comply with-
*  That's actually fringe probably.
*  It is fringe, but it's also fringe right. I mean, like it's, there's nothing wrong with being
*  conservative fiscally. There's nothing wrong with being conservative in the way you dress or the
*  way you behave. It's like when you go far right, then things get ugly, right? And it's the outside
*  edges on both parties are the mess. Most people, reasonable people, if they could have conversations
*  with folks, even if they had disagreed on certain things, they'd find themselves somewhere in a
*  comfortable discussion where you could at least sort through the ideas and try to figure out why
*  you think the way you think and why I think the way I think, why, how we disagree and are you right
*  or am I wrong? Like I want to know, you know, and most people don't. These kinds of conversations,
*  like trying to figure out if the person who opposes your philosophy or your perspective is right and
*  you're wrong. It's very uncomfortable for people. So what do they do? They just fucking shit on
*  anybody who's on the other side and they don't talk to them. There's very little exchange of ideas
*  in between the right and the left. One of the guys I really like talking to is Dan Crenshaw,
*  who's a right-wing guy. He's very reasonable, very reasonable. He's open-minded.
*  So much respect for doing that thing on SNL too.
*  Yes, yes. That was great.
*  That was such a nice mea culpa to see. And it's so rare nowadays, like this,
*  dividing line between right and left and things are just so hyper, hyper polarized.
*  So yeah, I mean, you can't, like guys will go on a Fox News show and people scream at them,
*  you know, how dare you use that? Like Jimmy Dore just did Tucker Carlson show and people
*  were just shitting on him all over the place for doing that and using his platform. Of course,
*  he's using his platform. He's getting good ideas out there.
*  Who, Tucker?
*  Jimmy Dore. Jimmy Dore is an amazing YouTube show.
*  It's fucking amazing. And the way he breaks down things, it's hilarious, but also accurate.
*  And from the far left too, which I disagree with him a lot politically, but like he's,
*  he actually entertains me.
*  Yes. He's an angry far left guy who's funny.
*  And he laughs like, wasn't Mutsi the dog that has the asthma laugh?
*  Oh, he's got a crazy laugh.
*  Yeah, exactly. I like people crazy laughs because their laugh just makes me laugh.
*  So I just watch for that purpose alone.
*  We need more discussions. You know, we need more people that, and the thing is, if you like,
*  people have gotten mad at me for having people on the podcast that are far right people,
*  particularly in the far past, like many years ago. And one of the things that's hilarious is
*  when they said his show has had this person, that person, this person, that person, all the,
*  all the negatives. And you're talking about 1500 plus episodes and you'll list like five or six
*  in a row as if that defines the show.
*  But like I said, this is the, another example of the political one drop rule.
*  Like you interviewed like one far right person. So you, the whole, ignore Jimmy door,
*  ignore that you have had Abby Martin, Edward Snowden, all these people on,
*  like you've done this far right person. Your whole show is far right. Therefore,
*  Rogan is a, you know, it's an alt right person.
*  Well, it's easy too, cause I look like one, like I look like I should be an alt right person.
*  No, you don't.
*  Yes, I do.
*  Why? Cause you work out?
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'm a bald cage fighting commentator. You know?
*  That, you know what? That, that's a terrible, I don't know why this correlation has really
*  started to exist, but, but it has, I saw, I saw an article, I think it was on the Guardian that said
*  something like, if you exercise too much, you're, there was an article about that. Like exercise is
*  kind of like a mask, like again, they're lumping all these concepts. Yeah. They're lumping all
*  these concepts together. I bet that article was written by a weak bitch.
*  Right. Right. It's just eating the fire. Sorry. No, it's, it's silly. There's a lot of like really
*  brilliant people who exercise all the time. Right. They just enjoy it. They enjoy having a body that
*  works really well. There's a lot of brilliant people that like racing cars too. Right. They're,
*  you know, they just enjoy the mechanical aspect of racing a car. It's kind of the same thing.
*  When you, you do something to your body to juice your body up, to make it stronger and faster and
*  work better. It doesn't mean you're dumb. Yeah. But there's no, you're toxic masculine,
*  but this stuff is insidious because it's bad enough to be in political silos. We're now in
*  cultural silos and they're mapping on each other. Right. So one of the things that happened when I
*  first moved here was that, you know, so I, cause I didn't grow up here. I, I wasn't, I didn't know
*  what I shouldn't like. So people would say like, Oh, you, you're Boston, like, you know, educated,
*  liberal coastal elite. Right. But then I was like, I love WWE. And so, so they're like, that's not
*  all people. Like, you know, I'm surprised you watched every WWE and I, you know, this was the
*  time of like Hardy boys and Lita. I grew up with that stuff. So people will be surprised and, and
*  they were pushed back on it. And it's, it's, it's increasingly become that way, like from a person's
*  consumption habits, what they like, hobbies, you're now able to map what, what politics they
*  will have or likely to have. And that's dangerous. Like we, we shouldn't be, we shouldn't be going
*  down this route. It's been very comforting for me to see how many left-wing intelligent, well-read,
*  educated people actually enjoy watching the UFC. So I've talked to so many of them, like you're a
*  fan, like, Oh, all right. And then they want to have these conversations with me about fights and
*  about this matchup and that match. I'm like, wow, this is really interesting. Like people that you
*  would never have associated with being like a fan, like Robert Downey Jr. UFC fan. And we're talking
*  to him about like, wow, Matt Damon, UFC fan. Yeah. Like, whoa.
*  Any, anybody breaking moles really should be elevated, you know, like, cause it's so right.
*  We just get more and more entrenched in these cluster. Right. And people are scared to like
*  things like WWE or like anything they like, you know, some, some people love fucking mosh pits.
*  You know, it's fake. I'm like, of course, but it's entertaining. Did you not see what Vince
*  did? Like it's just entertaining. Yeah, but they don't want you to like what they don't like,
*  which is, you know, it's thought bubbles, you know, it's what it is. It's like people love
*  when you are, we, people love when you're predictable, right? It's one of the reasons
*  why people love when people dress up in suits, you dress like a suit in a suit and you act like a
*  business person, you say words that are, you know, you, you speak in a very, a very similar
*  way to the other people that you work with. And it makes it easy to map out what you're probably
*  going to do and how you're going to react. There's a very narrow band that you're operating in.
*  When you're wearing a suit and a tie and you're in an office, there's a narrow band. You could be
*  the asshole suit and tie guy, or you can be the standard, you know, work language, human being,
*  gentlemen, you know, that, that kind of stuff is that's people like that because they know that
*  they can kind of predict you. They know where you, they know where you're going from. But when
*  you're eccentric and when you're outside the box, you're unpredictable and you have an eclectic taste,
*  they don't like it. You have interesting ideas that are, that are completely
*  irreverent and don't fit into these patterns. Like what is, what is she up to? What the fuck's
*  going on in her head? She's out there watching wrestling, pro wrestling. She actually likes it.
*  No, it's not. Yeah. It's pro fake wrestling, entertainment. Yeah. Entertainment wrestling.
*  Yeah. But some people don't like when you're unpredictable and they also don't like their
*  own ideas being challenged. It's one of the things that I think that people love about other people
*  that are deeply religious. If, if they, if you're deeply religious and they're deeply religious,
*  they know that they can talk to you in a certain way. Well, the Lord has a way of making things
*  work out. Yes, it does, Tom. Yes, it does. And they know that you're going to think, yeah. Amen.
*  You're going to think in this narrow bandwidth, you're not going to get outside that box. You're,
*  you're a good Christian. Well, I know Mike and Mike's a good Christian, you know, and all that
*  stuff I hear about him just doesn't make any sense to me. That's why it's a good control mechanism.
*  Yeah. Like it's easy to hurt people who, you know, like exists within this narrow band.
*  Well, that's why politicians almost always adopt some form of religious ideology. Even Trump,
*  Trump was basically never religious his entire life. Never. Exactly. He's got a religious,
*  that lady who has the Paula white or something. What are the, what the fuck her name is crazy,
*  but that lady is amazing. Like for she's so crazy that it's WWE. That's what it is. I mean,
*  Trump used to be in the WWE. I know. I totally remember those days. This lady is basically like
*  a wacky manager. She's like a wacky manager in the WWE that talks to God and helps Trump out.
*  That's how I look at it. I'm like, this is his wacky manager. He's got a character now. I mean,
*  he's got the fucking crazy hair. He's got this spray tan. It doesn't go all the way to the outside
*  edges. And he's got this wacky lady who I don't want to say he's banging her, but I wouldn't be
*  shocked. No, I'd be kind of hot. She kind of dirty old crazy religious lady way. I dirty,
*  milfy religious lady. I think she's fairly pretty. Isn't she? Give me, look at that. Not bad looking.
*  Listen, I like her. Yeah. The way she presents, but she's got the Karen hairstyle, which is not
*  attractive. The Karen hairstyle. LOL. Look at that. Look at him. He's not even, he's deeply in
*  thought. No, it's so obvious it's fake. Come on. How dare you? You don't know. He might be a changed
*  man. Yeah. Someone sounds school-minded. I don't like how you're thinking. You know what? I think
*  that's the thing that kind of ties all the threads of my life. It's just that I definitely oppose.
*  You know who I believe in that picture? Go back to that picture, please. You know who I believe in
*  that picture? Mike Pence. No, he's not there. No, that's not the picture. You fuck me, Jamie.
*  Wait, what picture? The picture that we were just looking at. It doesn't matter. See that lady in
*  the leopard skin? I believe her face. She's barely into this. That's a lot of contour. She's like,
*  what am I doing? What is this nonsense? And Trump is like, I can't believe I'm president.
*  I won. I'm going to win again. I'll have to do is listen to this crazy lady talk to me about Jesus
*  and people got to buy into it. I mean, it's a great move. You know, I mean, he didn't go secular
*  at all. Right? But if you look at his past and his history, like he's not a religious guy. And
*  all of a sudden he is. And nobody even questions it. It's just lip service, though. He's in the WWE.
*  She's his manager. Yeah. She's the wacky manager. I think Obama was similar. I think it was
*  performative. It's church going. I don't think he for a moment was. Is that her? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Okay. They get down. I guarantee you. They go back. They do Adderall together. They listen to the ACD
*  scene and they fuck like rabbits. She's got a crazy story. Does she? Yeah. Like addiction and
*  she came out of it. Yeah. She talked about how. Oh, she used to be addicted. Good. Even better.
*  That's the singer for Journey. No, the new singer. What do you mean? Which singer? Journey's
*  Jonathan Cain. No, not the singer. The singer is a Japanese gentleman. Have you, do you know that
*  Journey, like the, what was his name? Steven was the original guy's name. Steve, Steve Perry,
*  Steve Perry from Journey. Beautiful voice. You know that. Yeah. Well, now there's a Japanese guy
*  who does it and he was a Journey cover band guy and he's so good that when Steve Perry stepped
*  away, they hired him to sing the songs and he's fucking amazing. That guy. Which guy? That's the
*  guy that was the Paul, the spiritual advisors, the far right. That guy's the singer, the one in the
*  middle. Oh wow. He's amazing. He's very racially ambiguous. Um, in that picture. Is he, but he
*  said he's Japanese. I believe he's Japanese. Isn't he? Am I wrong? I don't know about Japanese.
*  I'll find out exactly that real quick. I thought I read he was Japanese. Anyway, he's a guy from a,
*  what's his name? Arnel. Hmm. Okay. Maybe that's Filipino. It sounds like. Oh, he can sing. So,
*  sorry, I'm wrong. Anyway, this guy sounds exactly like Steve Perry. Maybe even a touch better.
*  Wow. Maybe even a touch better. You want to hear a little? Yeah, play a little bit of it.
*  Give me a little bit. When did he? A few years back. Steve Perry. Yeah. Steve Perry wanted to
*  bail. He's like, I can't do this anymore, man. And this guy's like, I'll fucking do it. And they
*  listen to him like, damn dude, you can do it. He sounds exactly like Steve Perry. Okay. Give me some.
*  Come on. Brings me back to high school, baby. He's amazing. Wait, that, that was not. No,
*  that's him. That's this dude. Okay. How good? Yeah. I'm convinced. A little, maybe a little better.
*  Maybe a little better. I like the intensity. Just a touch. Just a touch better. Or maybe just sound
*  technology is improved. I'm not sure. That could be. You're being very generous. Yeah. Give me a
*  little more.
*  Come on. I had no idea. It's amazing. He's so good. I love that. That's a great story. That's a human story. You know, I love the story like that. Guys in a fucking cover band. All of a sudden he's a lead singer at Journey. I'm not surprised he's Filipino though. They're really good at singing. Oh, okay. They love character. They're really good at pool. Who? Filipinos. Okay. Some of the best pool players of all time. They see on my wall out there, I have two photos of signed photos of Filipino pool players.
*  Efren Reyes and Francisco. Fuck. What is this? God damn it. I can't remember his last name. Bata. Bata is Efren Reyes' and Dijango Francisco Bustamante. Francisco Bustamante. They're probably two of the top 10. Efren's probably number one ever. Efren Reyes. Most people agree with that. And Bustamante is probably top 10 of all time. I'm not sure we should be even positive racial stereotypes now or not. Those are positive. I know, but now they're not kosher anymore.
*  It's not that silly. The reason is what happened is in 1950s when American GIs were in the Philippines, they introduced pool to the Philippines and they started playing under really bad conditions because it's very moist outside, humidity, the tables roll really slowly.
*  And so they developed a lot of really good skills under bad conditions and then they would go to good conditions. And they also have a gambling culture. So there's a lot of gambling involved in pool. And so in pools everywhere, they have all these outside cafes with terrible pool tables. And these people just got really, really good at pool. And some of the to this day, some of the best players in the world come from the Philippines. Like when guys would see guys in tournaments and they would have to play a guy from the Philippines, they'd be like, oh fuck, here we go.
*  Wow. So it's like Chinese and ping pong.
*  Probably. I don't know about that though. I don't know too much about that.
*  That's actually true of even skiers, right? Like so people that kind of learned on like, I know the actually East Coast skiers that are highly represented in the Olympics because they trained on ice.
*  Oh, okay.
*  You got to get like, again, it's the tough conditions that kind of forges this like fortitude. Then you can adapt to any terrain. Versus like if you kind of, you know, grew up skiing the soft part of Colorado, you can't really switch that way.
*  I know. That's the thing. We're making things easier for people. We're making easier people.
*  That's why I have a, you know, one of the solutions I have for, you know, one of the questions of our time is how we fix journalism, right?
*  Yes.
*  One of the things I really think we need to do, because I'm not one of those people that thinks like the MSM or like the media is the problem. I mean, I'm kind of part of the media now. I write for Spectator USA, which is sort of Bridget and some of the other people that you've had on your show as well.
*  Bridget Phetasy. I love her.
*  Yeah, she's the one that actually pitched me.
*  She's hilarious.
*  She is really funny. I wish I had the freedom to be as inappropriate and hilarious as her.
*  You say that. I wanted to get back to that because you were talking about, well, go ahead with this thing about how to fix journalism.
*  Oh.
*  Get back to that.
*  So some of the best reporting that the New York Times really does is on the international stuff. So like they've sent people, they've sent journalists into like these areas in Xinjiang to like see what's up, you know, like, and they would be surveilled by government officials and things like that.
*  Or like even the ISIS files where, you know, this reporter in your Times reporter Rukmini had gone into Baghdad and like she just went in and like collected all these documents by herself.
*  And then, you know, they came back and they analyzed it and they reverse engineered how ISIS was running their entire operation.
*  This is really good journalism.
*  Yeah.
*  And when you kind of focus on the shit that's going on in other parts of the world gives you a lot of perspective.
*  You realize that like a lot of woke stuff is actually very America centric.
*  And if you had zoomed out, you would see that this wasn't a problem.
*  The thermostat issue of, you know, thermostats, office temperatures, you know, being sexist, for example, because they're too cold for women.
*  That's not a problem when you have seen how the women in Iran, what they have to deal with.
*  And if we just did a rotation in the newspapers where everybody from the lifestyle or culture desk has to do a stint in, you know, Saudi Arabia, something reporting from the...
*  Like maybe they'll just, maybe they'll have some perspective on this.
*  Sure.
*  Well, it is all perspective issue, right?
*  I mean, when in the absence of any real oppression, you find oppression everywhere.
*  Right.
*  Try to find it in pencils.
*  And...
*  Yeah, like progress is the victim of its own success in a way.
*  And, you know, that's one of the things that...
*  Because I had a big imposter syndrome when I first joined Spectator.
*  And what they told me was, I was like, you know, I'm not trained as a journalist.
*  And they're like, yeah, we know that.
*  But that's actually, you know, the chairman said like, that's why we want you.
*  It's because you didn't go to the same schools.
*  You didn't go to the same journalism school.
*  So you're not going to think like all the kids are graduating from, say, like Columbia, you know, for in journalism.
*  So we want different perspectives.
*  And it's like, in fact, it's a policy that we don't even ask for where you go to school.
*  We don't ask what you study.
*  We don't care.
*  So don't even tell us.
*  Wow.
*  And that's how I got like, you know, on board.
*  Just like that.
*  So do they just read your writing and say, we just like how you think?
*  Exactly.
*  Now, isn't that refreshing?
*  It is very refreshing.
*  It's wonderful.
*  Spectator USA.
*  Congrats to them.
*  Yeah.
*  Why do you think that you can't joke around about things?
*  And why do you think that that in some way is going to make people take you less seriously?
*  I think people put you in bins, right?
*  So professionally, like there's just, like you said, it's this like signal of like, how are you going to act?
*  Right.
*  How you dress, how you come across and in professional settings, that's there's an expectation of you as a certain behaving a certain way.
*  Now, when you're funny, the problem is that that people don't know, like you could say something, but like be totally ridiculous.
*  And it's a joke.
*  But then other people might take that seriously.
*  And now you're a racist or you.
*  Welcome to my world.
*  Right, right.
*  But you work for yourself.
*  You're Joe Rogan.
*  It's very different if you are, you know, if you are tethered to an organization that you have to represent.
*  At the end of the day, people can't separate that.
*  So, you know, part of my job is negotiating deals with many of the authors that you have on your show.
*  Right.
*  People like who write bestselling books, trying to ink deals with them.
*  I want your Arabic digital rights for free.
*  You know, I want to make videos of your books to video summaries and all these things.
*  We ink contracts with them, working with publishers, agents and then also fundraising.
*  I have to go to individuals to say, hey, you know what, it's going to cost us twenty thousand dollars to translate this book.
*  You know, would you want to sponsor it?
*  Like, you're a fan of this book.
*  Hey, can we get this in Arabic for free?
*  So when you're kind of like handling those things and going into offices and, you know, sometimes you go to Penguin Random House and it's it's it's a certain expectation set of you.
*  And I don't know if it's it's it's even more true of women, though, that like they don't expect you to be funny or like the funnier you are, the more they take you less seriously.
*  Versus then, I don't know, there seems to be a bit of a gender divide there.
*  I can see that.
*  I could see how that would be an issue, but I would like it to be their problem, not yours.
*  I like funny people.
*  So whenever someone says they're discouraged from being funny, and that's one of the things that I like about your Twitter page is it's funny.
*  You're very funny.
*  So like discouraging you from being funny to me is like, why would you do that?
*  You can't separate serious commentary.
*  Like, you know, no one's going to get you on.
*  I don't think that's true.
*  And how could how could that be true?
*  How is it true that someone who's just making jokes also can't be a serious person with a really well thought out perspective?
*  I know I agree with you, but it's it's it's just one of the feedbacks I've gotten.
*  Like you want to be taken seriously.
*  These people, people that are running things.
*  Maybe you need your own show.
*  Maybe you need to stop working for people.
*  No, I mean, I'm still believe in institutions.
*  That's why I'm not like super, you know, I don't want the revolution.
*  I still believe that the way we're going to change things is through right now.
*  There's just too much power.
*  And my heart would like a revolution, maybe.
*  What kind of revolution?
*  No, I'm just saying I'm not the kind of person that wants to tear down institutions.
*  Right.
*  I kind of want to work within it to change things because they have the best shot at changing things.
*  So in that sense, I'm not I'm not that much of an outsider.
*  I love this quote.
*  Actually, Elizabeth Warren said it.
*  She said in life, you have to choose.
*  Are you going to be an insider or an outsider?
*  An insider doesn't have the freedom of speech, but he has the power to change things.
*  An outsider can say whatever he or she wants.
*  You can bitch about the system.
*  You can be a whistleblower, but you have no power to change anything.
*  And you have to choose.
*  You do?
*  That's what that was her quote.
*  Is that an ancient Lakota quote?
*  No, actually, actually, no, I came from Larry Summers.
*  I don't know if that's accurate.
*  I don't know if you have to be an insider or an outsider.
*  I don't.
*  I think you have to have financial freedom so that you don't worry about someone taking away your ability to make a living.
*  So you suppress your own thoughts.
*  Correct.
*  That's the big one.
*  But it takes a very, you know, a lot of things have to be aligned circumstantially to have financial freedom in the first place.
*  And but a lot of that does come from even working within the institution.
*  A lot of people who have, you know, huge financial backing.
*  That's why somebody I think was Sarah Hayter, who tweeted something like the one thing that's not really talked about is the class's implications of cancel culture.
*  Because it's going to affect the lower class more drastically.
*  Right.
*  If you don't have the money, they're canceled.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  There's a huge class's implication to this.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  It's also just a frivolous way of treating human beings.
*  And there's no path for redemption.
*  It's like the thought process of it is so limited because you're not considering the fact that these these are humans and these are people and people learn and grow and they get better.
*  There's not offering any path to redemption and lumping all digressions and all mistakes into the same sort of pile.
*  Right.
*  It's just it's a childish way of treating human beings.
*  Right.
*  And it's also there's a fear to it that it's going to come back on you.
*  So you go after them.
*  Like some of the biggest creeps are also male feminists.
*  Right.
*  They're the ones who are like really.
*  Where do you say that?
*  You know, I mean, I already think that Andrew Doyle the other day.
*  That was funny.
*  Yes.
*  I love that guy.
*  He's amazing.
*  That book.
*  Well, it's a tiny.
*  I asked it to Tani McGrath.
*  So I love retweeting those to Tani posts because so many people like what the fuck is this?
*  Who is this bitch?
*  People get so mad.
*  They think she's real.
*  Oh, it's so wonderful.
*  But she could be in the sense that like sometimes she ends up predicting actual commentary.
*  She's so close to real.
*  This is like if you had a television show like one of them after midnight episodes.
*  Is that what it is?
*  What's that?
*  What's the David Spade show called?
*  Lights Out.
*  Lights Out.
*  I'm thinking of the other one, the one that Chris Hardwick used to host.
*  Anyway, you have a talk show.
*  Well, let's say Jimmy Kimmel.
*  If he had is this to Tani McGrath or is this a real activist?
*  And you and you had the quotes back to back.
*  A lot of them are close.
*  You know, be hard pressed.
*  You get a lot of it wrong.
*  We're at the point, though, in our history and culture that that we can't even write
*  better satire than reality.
*  Right.
*  And that's that's a problem.
*  It is a problem.
*  You know, when when our satirists are actually ended up end up writing better stories than or
*  even predicting, you know, what's happening.
*  Well, people are losing their fucking minds.
*  There was a video from the University of Phoenix, I think it was where there's this kid on
*  campus and there was some pro Trump group.
*  Did you see that video?
*  The kids screaming and saying, you're fucking fascist.
*  You're fucking Trump.
*  You're your throat's cut.
*  And he's screaming and he's walking away from them, screaming and making this.
*  You should all have your throats cut.
*  Just completely unhinged.
*  And I was watching this.
*  I was like, imagine if this was some kid yelling about Obama and the Obama administration
*  and the liberals, because he's not saying anything.
*  He's not saying the reason why I hate you is because you detain children at the border
*  and cages. Play this so I could hear it and play it and give me some.
*  OK, I saw that.
*  Listen, this.
*  OK, that poor kid needs a hug.
*  Yeah. But imagine if he was saying that about Democrats, every Republican or every Democrat
*  can suck my balls.
*  Every Republican slash every Democrat slash their throat.
*  That would be crazy.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  You mean he's doing that because there's this pro student Trump organization there.
*  And so he's screaming that unhinged.
*  That's one of the problems.
*  I think we should not give, you know, like we should not give the right legitimate reasons
*  to be complaining about disparate coverage.
*  Right. So one of the things that Trump tweeted yesterday was, which I didn't even know
*  happened, like apparently a van was was was driven into a GOP tent or something.
*  You know, one of the primaries and it got no coverage.
*  I didn't even see it until.
*  I don't I don't know.
*  But it's there was a story about this.
*  And you know, Eric Trump basically tweeted saying that imagine if the labels were turned
*  like it was just the other way around.
*  Right. We would hear nonstop.
*  There would be analysis of, you know, the far right problem in America.
*  And so we, you know, the responsibility is on the media to make sure that these people
*  don't have to argue.
*  Right. The media has to be open and they have to be unbiased in their depictions of these
*  things. And we don't really have that kind of media anymore.
*  We have left wing media and right wing media and everybody else is going, what's going on?
*  Is this who's right?
*  Who's telling the truth? You flip back and forth from CNN to Fox News.
*  It's like you're in a vortex of space and time.
*  You don't understand what's what.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  No, I agree.
*  It's weird. But that kid screaming, that poor kid, like what happened?
*  Where did you get this? Every Republican slashed their throat.
*  I know. Come on, man.
*  Who are you? What happened to you?
*  And you're in school.
*  So you're learning something.
*  I'm so I'm so weary of sort of dogpiling on this stuff.
*  I think I think when I first started on Twitter, too, I was always inflaming or like
*  retweeting something that was like, oh, look at this super world person that's on the
*  fringe. And I'm like, no, no, maybe I shouldn't amplify that signal.
*  Maybe maybe this really is a fringe in that.
*  And that, you know, I'm just kind of making it seem like it's a it's a bigger issue.
*  Because I notice I fall into that trap sometimes.
*  Like, that was this one story that came out, I think, when Apple released the new iPhone,
*  there was like New York Post was like, you know, iPhone 10 X or something was cited as
*  was criticized as being sexist.
*  And I was like, what? Why? How? How?
*  You know, and apparently because like the phone was kind of big, like they expanded the
*  dimensions. And so like it doesn't fit into women's hands as neatly as the old version
*  did. And then I was like, so I tweeted that angrily like, yeah, of course, like everything
*  sexist again, like checks notes, you know, iPhone sexist.
*  And then I realized I was kind of part of the problem, because when I looked into this
*  whole issue, it was literally just like two Twitter egg accounts.
*  And so like an article was written based on like what somebody who's anonymous said on
*  Twitter that was sexist.
*  And it could have been the Internet Research Agency in Russia just fucking with everybody.
*  Yeah, yeah. Or Titania.
*  Yeah. Or another version of Titania.
*  But that's it is it is so I kind of stopped doing that stuff.
*  I decided to become a bit more responsible on my own Twitter account.
*  And yeah, focus on different things.
*  I mean, we already have a lot of good commentators who are fighting this fight, right?
*  People like James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian.
*  Yeah, they're doing it very rigorously.
*  And they're doing it in Peter Boghossian's case.
*  They're doing it at great peril.
*  Like that university is trying to get rid of them.
*  Yeah. And his papers that they did, those grievance papers are hilarious.
*  I know the heteronormative and queer behavior and dog parks.
*  And I was cause whatever is called.
*  Yeah. Fucking brilliant.
*  Right. And then they got called up for apparently manufacturing data.
*  Yes. Which, of course, that's the whole point of a hoax.
*  Yes. And yeah, I know it's a political hijab.
*  Yeah. But it's they don't like that mirror of mockery.
*  They don't like that, you know, the spotlight being on them to realize how ridiculous what
*  you guys are supposed to be some higher Institute of higher education.
*  But that's what that you know, this this is mirroring what happened when like the atheist,
*  the new atheist started debating this, the religious Christians.
*  It's like the new atheists were kind of mocking, right?
*  Like people like Christopher Hitchens.
*  That was a bit of a mocking tone, like what you'll believe is kind of silly.
*  Yes. And but the way they reacted to it was that like you're not allowed to laugh about the
*  stuff. Right. It's always the question is which side can tolerate humor?
*  You're going to be on the right side.
*  Right. I agree. Yeah.
*  As soon as you can't be mocked and like no one hates being mocked more than the left
*  these days. No one more than woke people.
*  Right. I called my 2016 Netflix special triggered just calling it triggered.
*  Got so many people mad.
*  Right. I'm like, you fucking dummies.
*  Do you know? I just did it. I just did it to you.
*  But called it triggered and you were mad.
*  Yeah, that's funny.
*  No, it's just we're in a weird space right now where there's so many voices.
*  So many people have social media and so many people have access to complaining.
*  And so you get this bizarre signal.
*  It's like you've got to kind of let it die down a little figure out what how much of this is real.
*  And how much of it is that kid screaming slash their thoughts?
*  How many of those people are in Twitter?
*  We would never have seen that. Right.
*  So so I used to say the same thing because you know you would see medical journals reporting
*  cancer rates are going up and it's like cancer is is that really the case?
*  Are we having more and more, you know, incidences of cancer?
*  Or is it that our detection methods have gotten better, like diagnostics have gone better
*  and we're just able to catch it at a much earlier stage.
*  So it's kind of inflating the case number.
*  Yes. So it's hard.
*  It's really hard to tell.
*  And, you know, it seems it seems I'm so, you know, boyed by the fact that in the last few
*  months seems like mainstream culture, even comedy starting to push back.
*  You have more and more people who say, OK, enough of this stuff.
*  Well, come to the comedy store.
*  That's the front line.
*  The comic store is the least woke comedy club in the history of the universe.
*  Is it related to the seller?
*  No. OK.
*  Because the seller is really least woke to the one in New York.
*  Stand up is pretty un-woke.
*  And the thing is, the audiences want to hear this stuff.
*  They want to hear mocking all this shit.
*  They want to hear it and they enjoy it.
*  And, you know, you get pushed back.
*  Sometimes people get up and get mad because you said the wrong word.
*  No, they'll leave. But you're missing the point.
*  The point is to say the wrong word.
*  You know, like what stand up is supposed to be is mocking everything that can be
*  mocked. And if it can be mocked, it will be mocked.
*  And if it's funny, the audience will laugh.
*  And if you're like, you shouldn't mock that.
*  But it just did.
*  Or you shouldn't punch down.
*  Don't want like that's another thing you hear quite a bit.
*  That's a weird one, too, because you shouldn't punch down if it's not funny.
*  But if it's really funny and you're punching down their exceptions.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Sam Kinnison, one of his greatest bits ever, was making fun of
*  people starving in Africa.
*  What? Yep.
*  It was a bit about those television late night commercials where you're sitting at
*  home cooking your dinner.
*  You know, and well, Sam Kinnison's bit is a like a real classic.
*  You know, it's like, would you help?
*  Would you please help?
*  And he's like, why don't you help?
*  You're right next to him.
*  And he goes, why don't you instead of sending him money or sending him food,
*  he'll send him something like me.
*  Send him someone who's going to go down there.
*  Hey, we just drove five thousand miles with your food.
*  We realized we wouldn't have world hunger if you people would move where the food
*  is. You live in a fucking desert.
*  And it's like this long, crazy bit of Sam Kinnison mocking, starving people.
*  Right. But it's hilarious because it's done the right way.
*  It's it's he navigated that minefield where you don't feel bad.
*  He goes, you see that? See that? You know what it is?
*  That's fucking sand. You know, it's going to be 100 years from now.
*  Fucking sand. We've got deserts in America, too.
*  We just don't live in them, asshole.
*  And he's doing obviously that's not real.
*  These people are stuck. They don't have the ability.
*  They don't have the resources to get out. There's a real problem.
*  They've been there. The climate has changed.
*  There's all these real issues. Right.
*  There's all real issues. But it's horrible.
*  But you're dying laughing, particularly in 1986 when he did this.
*  But there's there's there's there has to be like a theory of humor,
*  like why that's funny versus another case where he's punching down and it's not.
*  Good luck with your theory. Here's the thing about theories.
*  Theories are like theories are pro.
*  You probably could.
*  In a like, so you could do a postmortem on a joke
*  and you could accurately dissect why it worked.
*  I don't think you could predict how a joke will work,
*  because too many jokes are dependent upon the personality,
*  the irreverence of the perspective, cultural context, time.
*  Yes, timing.
*  The personality, the person doing it is giant.
*  Kinnison always had this little smile and this devious smirk.
*  And he could get away with more fucked up shit because that was his
*  that was his brand.
*  You know, like that wouldn't work with Steven Wright.
*  Steven Wright was a sort of absurdist perspective and, you know,
*  non sequitur one liners.
*  If he had a joke like that, it wouldn't work.
*  But with Kinnison, with the yelling and the anger and, you know,
*  and he was fat and ugly and, you know, he's always angry.
*  That's like, you know, we talk about marriage and getting divorced.
*  You felt bad for him. Right.
*  If Brad Pitt was out there screaming about getting divorced,
*  you'd be like, that beautiful fuck. He should shut his mouth.
*  He's beautiful.
*  But Kinnison is like five feet tall and fat and balding.
*  And he's got a beret on. It's like, let him yell.
*  Yeah. I know this this analysis, like the anatomy of humor really fascinates me.
*  Like why somebody can get away with it, why somebody cannot.
*  And I think I remember when just recently,
*  because Ari Schaeffer did that joke about Kobe, like right after he passed away.
*  And yeah, he was that that wasn't necessarily a joke,
*  which is also part of the problem.
*  It was a mocking of someone.
*  And the joke is in his mocking.
*  If people knew Ari, they would know that he does that whenever anyone dies,
*  including people he loves.
*  That's Ari's thing.
*  And it's fucked up if you don't know Ari.
*  But even if you like, well, I read it, I was like, oh, Jesus, Ari.
*  But that's it's I've come to expect it.
*  Like he did it when Tom Petty died. He loved Tom Petty.
*  He mocked Tom Petty mercilessly when Tom Petty died, when Aretha Franklin died.
*  He mocked her mercilessly.
*  You know, it's what he does.
*  It's sort of his signature move.
*  And he takes pleasure in and his fans think it's hilarious.
*  But the best way to describe it is the way he looks at it.
*  He has a very niche audience when it comes to that.
*  And then that joke or that thing that he does that's funny
*  to him and his crazy fans hit a broad audience.
*  And that's when it became a problem.
*  No, it takes a lot of balls to do comedy.
*  I really respect that so much.
*  It's a strange way to make a living, especially today.
*  Well, Ari had a great point about that, too.
*  Ari's a brilliant guy.
*  I used to love his amazing racist stuff.
*  I know, but it's not supposed to say that.
*  It's like from 2013.
*  It's old. Yeah.
*  But the one with the Asian driving instructor thing was so funny.
*  I would. It drives me hysterical.
*  I show that to a lot of people.
*  He's a brilliant stand up, too.
*  He's a very, very funny guy.
*  I forget what I was going to say about him.
*  But oh, yeah, he had this point about comedy.
*  He's like, this is a great time for comedy right now because comedy is dangerous again.
*  Like, it's really dangerous again.
*  There's actually consequences.
*  Yeah, yeah, it was.
*  You could get away.
*  It wasn't there wasn't as many consequences.
*  People could not like it.
*  But now with social media and the cancel culture and everything,
*  like people get really angry at comedy now.
*  Like, whoa, you can feel it.
*  Oh, OK. He's a masochist.
*  No, it's not that he's a masochist.
*  It's just that he's an artist.
*  And he loves the fact that, you know, it's like it's very punk rock now.
*  It is, you know, wild comedies, very punk rock like you.
*  You're bucking a trend.
*  But you're also doing it to the light of audiences, you know?
*  Yeah. I mean, if anybody thinks that you shouldn't say some of the things I say,
*  come see me in an arena, come see 15000 people screaming, laughing at that.
*  I don't think you're right.
*  I think people understand what a joke is.
*  I think people understand that you're saying things that if you took them out
*  of context and put them in a blog, it looks horrible.
*  But if you're saying it in the context of comedy, when you know that someone's
*  just fucking around, it's really funny.
*  And it's funny for because people want to release from all this nonsense.
*  They want to release from this restrictive way of thinking and talking.
*  They want to release it from being told what to do.
*  They want to release from these fucking kids yelling,
*  Slash their fucking throats.
*  It's like, God damn it. What are we doing here?
*  And that's where comedy comes in.
*  Yeah. My release was just moving.
*  Yes. Oh, yeah.
*  Just moved to a place that all this stuff was possible and that we could laugh at
*  ourselves again.
*  And that's probably why you have this really interesting perspective,
*  is because of the fact you came from real suppression.
*  Yeah. You understand real suppression, real consequences.
*  You left that and then you're seeing these minor consequences and you're like,
*  okay, you guys, this is a problem.
*  Like you need to go to Afghanistan for a couple of weeks.
*  You need to see what it's like in like really suppressive cultures.
*  Exactly. How it changes your mind.
*  How it you end up self-censoring.
*  You don't even need the government to do it anymore after a while.
*  Because you're scared. Yeah.
*  Because you're scared. But does it matter if it's the government or the Twitter mob?
*  After a while, the result is going to be similar,
*  even though the consequences are different and we should definitely separate that.
*  I rather lose my job than lose my life.
*  Well, it's also it's in the with wokeness in particular,
*  like in the propagation of wokeness and in the promotion of wokeness
*  and the very strict adherence to this ideology and the aggressive
*  takedowns of people that don't comply.
*  You are you're essentially instigating a sort of totalitarian way of thinking.
*  But it's just in a way that you think is good.
*  But it's still a totalitarian way of thinking.
*  You're implementing this very rigid ideology and you're demanding compliance.
*  Purity. Yes.
*  And people don't comply. You're going after them.
*  That is everything that is against being a liberal progressive thinker.
*  Exactly. You're supposed to be a person who promotes discourse
*  and open minded communication.
*  And if you like, Darrell Davis is the best version of that ever.
*  He's the best version of it because all he is,
*  is a musician who is a very eloquent and articulate person
*  who had the patience to sit down with people that believed in a really fucking stupid thing.
*  And just through his mere existence and who he is as a person,
*  he changed the way they thought.
*  That is so powerful.
*  And that's been more powerful than all the punch and Nazi people.
*  Yes, the Nazi people. It's such a problem.
*  My friend Kurt was talking to this guy who's a very prominent
*  left wing thinker, a very powerful person.
*  And my friend Kurt was talking to him and he's like,
*  and the guy was like saying to him, what's wrong with punching a Nazi?
*  He goes, here's the problem. Who's going to decide who the Nazi is?
*  Like, we're not talking about real Nazis.
*  When you say punch a Nazi, you might be talking about your granny,
*  who's a Republican, because she likes Trump because Trump believes in God.
*  Isn't his granny a Nazi? Right.
*  Well, Antifa thinks that well, at least the New Jersey Antifa
*  thinks that Darrell Davis is a Nazi.
*  So, yeah, you're right.
*  So the concept creep.
*  But it works, works to your advantage.
*  If this is, you know, it there are people for whom the incentives
*  are are are there to to make it seem like the enemy is really that big,
*  because then you can implement all the solutions you want.
*  Exactly.
*  You know, the population gets cowered in a fear, basically.
*  It's it's a again, it's another totalitarian.
*  Yeah, it's almost like you're creating intellectual false flags.
*  You're propping up all the all any divergence from this rigid ideology.
*  Some some horrible fucking thing that needs to be attacked,
*  squashed and poisoned and lit on fire.
*  But ultimately, at the end of the day, what we really need to do
*  is just be nicer to each other.
*  And part of our problem is lack of communication.
*  And if you go to these things like when you see someone trying to close down
*  a Christina Hoffs summer's speech, what you're seeing is them yelling.
*  It's yelling. It's it's like screaming, setting off fire alarms,
*  screaming that people are fascist.
*  That's not communication.
*  That's just like if you're talking to someone like blah, blah, blah,
*  not listening to you, blah, blah, blah.
*  It's childish.
*  And the fact that this is all taking place at universities is so discouraging.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the fact that people think this it's supported.
*  And here's another problem.
*  The people on the left that aren't that way,
*  but think that these people like Antifa are probably good
*  because they're like the bulldogs, they're like the attack dogs of the left.
*  And they'll go after the right and they'll they'll they'll they'll
*  reinforce our ideas.
*  You don't understand the consequences of this.
*  You're just going to with with all the energy that goes in a negative way
*  from the left, you're getting more energy that goes in a negative way from the right.
*  It's a yin yang thing.
*  It's it's it's a Hegelian dialectic pendulum swings.
*  Pendulum swing. Yes.
*  And it's inevitable.
*  It's been a part of human interaction forever.
*  The best way to communicate with someone is never yelling at them
*  and screaming at them.
*  The best way is to listen, listen to their ideas and wear them out with logic.
*  Wear them out with long conversations like the best way
*  for two people who have.
*  A separate view of the world,
*  put those put those separate views of the world together, sit down.
*  You tell me your view of the world, tell me in particular,
*  if we can keep it in a narrow scope, we're both educated about what we're talking about.
*  And we're not talking about something when the other person has really no data
*  to draw from. Have a conversation.
*  Sit down, talk it through.
*  It's possible we can get back to doing that.
*  The problem is we're so accustomed over the last 10 years to communicating digitally.
*  We're so accustomed to blaring our ideas out and then checking to see who agrees
*  every five seconds, checking our likes and checking our our comments.
*  This is a non social way of interacting through social media.
*  Social revolves cues.
*  People sitting apart from each other, looking into each other's eyes,
*  being in the same space as each other.
*  That's how humans are designed to communicate.
*  That's how we evolved to communicate.
*  So we're basically spending the vast majority of our time
*  debating issues in an unnatural way.
*  I would say it's a bit of a luxury now because like it feels like it's very easy
*  and very popular to kind of shit on social media in general. Right.
*  Like great aspects for sure.
*  Oh, my. Well, and you know, without it,
*  I we couldn't be reaching part of the world that that censors things. Right.
*  Without you and I would have never talked. Exactly. Yeah.
*  We would never have this conversation.
*  It allows you.
*  I think Steven Pinker once wrote about this.
*  It was like the difference between common knowledge and shared knowledge.
*  Common knowledge is like we both know something to be true.
*  But shared knowledge is is that we know I know that you know that I know something.
*  So it's recursive and that creates a very different environment.
*  Like, you know, imagine if you are the one lone atheist in Saudi Arabia
*  and there was no way for you to reach other people, you would think you're
*  completely by yourself, that you're the only one that thinks different.
*  But in the world where you can reach out and you can read other perspectives,
*  all of a sudden you realize that, wait, I know that I'm not alone.
*  I know that you know that I know that I'm, you know, and it
*  it changes how you feel in terms of just ideologically, just just safety.
*  And it creates real change.
*  Yes. One of my favorite quotes of all time was was in this manifesto written.
*  I can't remember the name now, but it was about the, you know, a free Internet.
*  And so the problem is that we cannot separate the air that makes
*  wings beat from the air that chokes.
*  And I was like, it's so poetic because you remember these cases of
*  these girls that were escaping Saudi Arabia and then she got locked up in Thailand.
*  And she was saying, I'm trying to escape from my my my father.
*  He's I don't want to have a hijab anymore.
*  I want to break out.
*  My family would kill me if they find out I'm, you know,
*  I don't want this arranged marriage or whatever.
*  And and the only reason she can reach the outside world and that activists,
*  you know, lawyers heard her story and could help her.
*  And she got asylum in Canada.
*  It's because of social media.
*  So it's like the more we want to regulate these things,
*  the more we're making it hard for a lot of these people who live in still
*  close societies, because the only way to get in is through the Internet.
*  I think the Internet in general is like most things.
*  There's no it's it's not binary.
*  It's not one or zero.
*  It's not great or bad.
*  It's both those things altogether.
*  There's amazing aspects of social media.
*  I mean, just the distribution of information is so radically increased over the last 10 years.
*  But right now we're focusing so much on the bad.
*  Yes, you know, there was we're focusing too much on the way it's used negatively
*  and really not accounting for the things that it has brought.
*  Yeah, I think you're right.
*  Yeah, I mean, it's I think all of it is moving in a good direction.
*  This is one of the reasons why I don't completely hate this whole woke ideology.
*  No, I don't. I'm mock it like what I was saying.
*  Like when I say I'm in support of a lot of people like Bernie
*  and people that go with him because I think they want good things.
*  I think they want a society that's more kind and inclusive.
*  Oh, to be fair, Bernie did him like as a person like himself personally,
*  wasn't a big identity politics guy at all.
*  In fact, in 2016, not all, you know, times have a bit changed.
*  It's just easier to do it now.
*  So you slide right in, get more support.
*  It's just it's a weird it's a weird battlefield now.
*  Ideological battlefield.
*  And it's causing the Democratic Party to split.
*  Yeah, it's it's kind of hilarious.
*  It's just I love fake shit.
*  I love when people like obviously fake.
*  I love when they give fake speeches and they do fake
*  political things with their thumb in their hand like that.
*  I love that stuff.
*  I just love when they fall into those patterns.
*  Just but it makes it it's so obvious now.
*  It's obvious. Yeah.
*  But that's why I got Andrew Andrew Yang stands out in such stark contrast.
*  Like, who is that guy doing there?
*  Seems like a regular guy.
*  I'm just really upset that we'll never get the image of Andrew Yang
*  doing the whipped cream bukkake thing in the White House.
*  Did you see that?
*  What is he going to do?
*  You know, see the story?
*  No, he always his followers.
*  Yes.
*  No, he was christening his New Hampshire office. Right.
*  And then squirting whipped cream in people's mouths.
*  Exactly. His staffers mouth. Right.
*  And it's one of the funniest thing.
*  Like, nobody told him what the optics were.
*  Right. That looks like white cream and you're shooting in people's.
*  And he's on his knees.
*  Yes. That's all that's wrong.
*  But but I'm just upset that this is not going to happen.
*  The White House.
*  Like, I thought that that's it's probably happening right now with Trump
*  and his WWE manager.
*  They're probably in the White House right now doing that exact.
*  That was a really bad hit piece on Andrew Yang in the New York Times.
*  That was so bad that people started like they had to disable the comments.
*  Why did they do that? Why did they do those?
*  They were finding disgruntled ex-employees of his to basically shit on him.
*  And like one of the complaints was that he pressures people to do karaoke.
*  Well, what a monster.
*  I know. I'm like, that's the worst you could find, you know, in 20 years
*  of employment history, no one is going to pass your purity test.
*  No one. No one.
*  I totally agree.
*  Especially if you actually turn the light on them.
*  Everybody's flawed.
*  And especially if you only highlight those flaws outside
*  of the context of whatever the fuck they were talking about
*  and the conversations they were having and what was going on.
*  And you could make a very distorted perception of someone
*  by just snipping and piecing together.
*  That's so that's why it's so insidious.
*  Yeah. Well, it's also why it's weird when it's coming from journalists.
*  Like you should know what you're doing.
*  You should know that this is not an accurate or objective analysis
*  of who this person is.
*  But that's what I mean.
*  The person who wrote this article, who, you know, was like saying, oh,
*  he's uncomfortable with language.
*  And there was some there was some implication in the piece
*  that like he he's clumsy with how he deals with women staffers.
*  Right. And it's like, yeah, OK, this guy is a tech nerd.
*  You know, maybe he's got some social cue reading such issues.
*  I mean, I do, too.
*  And it's like to drag someone, you know, to basically like sling
*  mud at somebody like that. It's it's horrible.
*  The thing is, though, they're doing it because that's what sells.
*  You know, these magazines and newspapers have become
*  sort of slaves to clickbait.
*  They they kind of have to get clicks.
*  I mean, you talk to people that are actual journalists now
*  and the pressure that's on them to get a bunch of clicks for each article.
*  And, you know, they'll have editors that change the title of their articles
*  to make it more salacious.
*  But that's why they did the whole paywall thing. Right.
*  So then your time's transition to subscription.
*  Can we discuss it for that purpose?
*  It's that they won't be subject to the whims of what they still are.
*  They still are, because a lot of those things you get through
*  your Google News feed and, you know, you have to click through to the paywall.
*  If you want to read it.
*  But the initial titles would get you to click the link.
*  And then you realize it's paywall.
*  You don't just sign up without reading anything.
*  You go there because there's an article that's interesting to you.
*  Right. And then you are that confirms your worldview.
*  Yes. Yes. Or goes against it.
*  You get angry. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I don't know. I mean, I have to say in that regard, I'm lucky
*  that I don't have that pressure.
*  Yeah, they just let me write whatever.
*  You know, there's no. Yeah, there's no. That's awesome.
*  Listen, I got to wrap this up, but I appreciate what you're doing.
*  I think it's wonderful this idea that you're getting these books
*  to these people and converting it, converting the languages
*  so that they can understand some of these great works.
*  And yeah, I mean, it's a step in the right direction.
*  And again, your Twitter feeds awesome.
*  Tell people tell people
*  where they can get a hold of you on social media.
*  Twitter at Miss M.S.
*  Melchen, M.E.L. C.H.N.
*  My own website.
*  Do you do Facebook?
*  I do. But like, no, that's my rebellion.
*  My millennial rebellion.
*  No Instagram. OK. Yeah.
*  Well, thank you. I enjoy talking to you.
*  This is a lot of fun. A lot of fun. Thanks. OK. Bye, everybody.
