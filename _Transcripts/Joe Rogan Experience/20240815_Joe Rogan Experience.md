# Joe Rogan Experience #2189 - Dennis Quaid
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LItpn8ilHRg)
*  Joe Rogan podcast, checking in!
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Nice to meet you, man.
*  You too, man.
*  Really.
*  It's been a pleasure.
*  I've seen so many of your fucking movies.
*  It's always weird when you meet someone that you've seen so many times in movies.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, all right, there he is, a real person.
*  Yeah, there they are.
*  I didn't know you released a gospel album, though.
*  Yeah, last year.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah, it's called Fallen, a gospel record for sinners, because I wanted the biggest
*  possible audience I could get.
*  Gospel record for sinners?
*  Yeah.
*  How long have you been singing gospel?
*  Well, you know, basically I grew up in the Baptist church, and so it's five songs that
*  it's five songs that I wrote before and during the making of the record.
*  It's kind of like my spiritual journey, I guess.
*  That's the way it turned out in the end.
*  My wife, she put the order together, and that's what it seems to be, kind of my journey in
*  life.
*  Was this something that you had thought about for a while, or did it just kind of...?
*  Yeah.
*  I wrote this song called On My Way to Heaven, and I wrote it for my mom to let her know
*  that I was okay after I got out of rehab for cocaine in 1990.
*  And then I wrote Fallen, which is kind of like taken from, remember that movie Thunder
*  Road with Robert Mitchum?
*  It's kind of like in that vein or that kind of feel to it, and there's this highway called
*  the Devil's Backbone up near Bandera.
*  And so it's a ride with the devil, and you wind up getting left for dead on the side
*  of the road.
*  So this is just something that you felt like, like, fuck it, I've done everything else,
*  why not do a gospel album?
*  Yeah, you know, I've recorded, I've always been a songwriter.
*  I got a guitar when I was 12 years old, my grandfather bought me at Western Auto.
*  It's a great place to buy guitars.
*  And I realized I was never going to shred a guitar, so songwriting became like a defense,
*  something you could bring to a band.
*  And so I've always done it.
*  But I got this offer from Gaither, because they heard, Bill Gaither had heard this song
*  on my way to heaven, asked me to do a gospel record.
*  So I said yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, it was a great experience, really.
*  And on my way to heaven, in fact, Tanya Tucker heard it, and she called me up out of the
*  blue.
*  I hadn't seen her like in 30 years, and said she wanted to do it.
*  So I said okay, and then she called me 15 minutes later, and she said Chris Christopherson
*  wants to do it.
*  And wow.
*  Brandi Carlile's doing a backup singing on it, and it's in myself, and we're going to
*  put that out this year as a single.
*  Wow, that's awesome.
*  Chris is just the greatest.
*  I love that guy.
*  I love him.
*  One of the highway men.
*  Yeah.
*  Come on.
*  Yeah, no kidding.
*  Wow.
*  So you were telling me that you got to Hollywood in the 70s?
*  Yeah, I went out there.
*  I was born in Houston, you know, and grew up there, and I was in acting class.
*  Mr. Pickett, we always bring him up because so many people actually started working.
*  My brother was his student as well, and my brother was already out there in California,
*  and he had been nominated for the last atale and stuff.
*  So I kind of realized, hey, you can actually do this stuff, you know, and get paid for
*  it.
*  And I went out there in 75 and just driven and got an agent after about a year.
*  Wow.
*  Did you have any previous acting experience?
*  Yeah, in college.
*  I wasn't serious about it in high school.
*  I was going to be a veterinarian.
*  That's what I wanted to be.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  I was a vet's assistant up in East Texas.
*  I'd spent summers up in East Texas, you know, in Jacksonville, Frankston.
*  And I worked for a vet when I was, you know, 14, 15, and that's what I was going to do
*  until one day we did like a house call out to this guy's farm to castrate his horse.
*  And the farmer didn't want to sit out there in the field and wait for him to wake up from
*  a full anesthetic, so they only gave him half of it and cinched his legs up like this.
*  And that horse stood up on two legs and it was just, man, it was horrific.
*  And that kind of, I think that's what changed my mind.
*  Maybe I should be an actor.
*  And I'll play a veterinarian.
*  Yeah, I'm sure the horse was not enjoying that.
*  No.
*  Yeah, that's got to be a bad feeling.
*  Also, as a man, like I don't want to do that.
*  I didn't do that to my dog.
*  No.
*  I don't do that to any of my dogs.
*  No, you can get that done for free in California.
*  Right.
*  Even if you're a person.
*  What the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  Very different in the 70s, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  You went through, like, 70s in Hollywood must have been a weird experience, man.
*  Oh, it was fantastic.
*  It was amazing, man.
*  That whole era of the 70s, you know, which started with Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider.
*  Great films.
*  Yeah.
*  Great films are in that film.
*  But there was the French New Wave, you know, is what they called it, you know, kind of
*  more handheld, grittier.
*  And it was the return of the anti-hero and the rebel hero.
*  And because Hollywood had lost touch with their audience, you know, they were making
*  movies like Toby Tyler and, you know, these bloated musicals.
*  And so it became like the inmates had taken over the asylum.
*  There was really new, exciting stuff getting done, like, you know, Badlands and The Conversation,
*  you know, which led to The Godfather.
*  And it's, that was, I think, the golden age of filmmaking.
*  Well, certainly some amazing films came out of that era.
*  And it's just, just seeing Los Angeles today and imagining what it was like in the 70s.
*  It had to be because, I mean, really movies, if you really think about it, they were only
*  a few decades old back then.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a new thing, essentially.
*  Yeah.
*  They just like perfected it.
*  I mean, really, it was only like 10 years into where all the movies were color.
*  They were making black and white movies up to like 63, you know.
*  Right.
*  Like The Hustler was black and white.
*  Yeah.
*  That was 63.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was an exciting time.
*  Like I said, the inmates had taken over the asylum and it was a feeling like you could
*  do just about anything.
*  And music too was really happening in Los Angeles as well.
*  Record deals were getting signed left and right.
*  And it, you know, there was this, it's kind of turned upside down now because of all that
*  rebellious attitude of the 70s and everybody, that it sort of became the establishment,
*  I think.
*  Yeah.
*  Bizarre, right?
*  because it started to kind of really turn politically correct in the 90s.
*  And it became kind of a nobody stays at a party after 11 o'clock.
*  Is that when you went into rehab?
*  Yeah.
*  After that, no matter where you're going, you know, afterwards you had to pretend you
*  were going to bed.
*  Oh, look at the time.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, look at the time.
*  I guess everybody had kids too by that point.
*  But then it just, it got to where we are today that, you know, you're getting warned to keep
*  your mouth shut because of, it turned upside down.
*  Well, it's also one ideology dominates, especially in Hollywood, dominates the entire business.
*  You know, one of the things that I said that drove me crazy about Hollywood was there's
*  people that had differing opinions about things, but they would never speak out because it
*  could damage their career.
*  Right.
*  And it really can.
*  What's going on now?
*  They will fucking blackball you.
*  They will?
*  I mean, they tried, you know, there were a couple of attempts to cancel me while we were
*  making Reagan, in fact, you know, kind of half-hearted, I guess.
*  But it has become that, you know, and that ain't right.
*  I mean, back then, you know, few people really were, I guess, conservative.
*  Let's throw out parties and just call it conservative.
*  I mean, you had John Wayne.
*  John Voight.
*  Yeah.
*  But you didn't know if John Voight was conservative back then.
*  He wasn't vocal about it?
*  Not back in the 70s, no.
*  But it was basically John Wayne and Charlton Heston.
*  And that was pretty much about it.
*  Or anybody wearing a tie.
*  But how did the rebels become, like, what the fuck happened?
*  How did the rebels become the establishment?
*  That is, we went through an era where we're a member of tolerance.
*  That was what we were trying to do, like, back in the teens, I think, in the tens, where
*  you tolerate other groups and all that.
*  And that didn't last very long.
*  And it seems like one had it over the other.
*  But if you ask me where this great divide really started politically, I think, of course,
*  there was Watergate.
*  But you come up to, like, when the Republicans had their contract with America, I think it
*  was like 94 in the year that Clinton was going to be a lame duck president, had those midterms.
*  And then it started to become just along party lines where there was no, you know, you were
*  a traitor if you went to the other side.
*  Because we had conservative Democrats, we had liberal Republicans up until that point.
*  That's what I grew up with.
*  And that wasn't good enough anymore.
*  And so it started there and then continued.
*  And then the Democrats really took over.
*  And they really do it really well as far as that stuff of turning things on their head.
*  And I feel like today they were using the judicial system against Trump, which is really
*  off the reservation.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Well, they're using the judicial system against Trump.
*  The entire media establishment, other than Fox News, is completely against anything Republican.
*  Did you see on Colbert the other day, Kristen Collins said her name?
*  Yeah, I saw that.
*  She said, Colbert says, CNN just reports the facts.
*  The whole audience starts laughing.
*  Yeah, was that a laugh line?
*  Yeah, he goes, well, I guess it is.
*  Yeah, which is hilarious.
*  People get it.
*  Oh, they do get it.
*  That's what the bolsters mean, is that people do get it.
*  Sometimes I think everybody just swallowing this.
*  There's a lot of people that are still swallowing.
*  A lot of boomers, a lot of older folks that are just swallowing whatever's in the newspaper
*  and whatever's on television.
*  A lot of people aren't news wonkies like you and I.
*  Yeah.
*  They just get the sound bites.
*  Exactly.
*  That's what they do it for.
*  Well, it's disheartening.
*  The more you do a deep dive on the actual facts about a thing.
*  I've heard people repeat, I've had conversations with people, they go, well, Trump's a felon.
*  He's convicted of 34 felonies.
*  I go, okay, do you know what those things are?
*  Do you know that they are misdemeanors?
*  Misdemeanors.
*  Do you know that the statute of limitations had run out on this little misdemeanor?
*  Yeah, the whole thing is the same.
*  It wasn't a campaign contribution.
*  They just did all kinds of gymnastics to make it happen.
*  And then the third person in line in the Justice Department comes back to New York to oversee
*  this case.
*  And just-
*  It's just incredibly dangerous.
*  It's incredible.
*  It's incredibly dangerous.
*  Because it can also be turned around.
*  Yes.
*  And there has to come a point where we go, stop.
*  We have to stop this or we're losing our country.
*  Yeah, I think they're more concerned with being in power than they are with preserving
*  the idea of democracy.
*  I totally agree with that.
*  And I think some of that was certainly they were emboldened by the fact they're essentially
*  running the country without a president for the last three years.
*  Yes.
*  Because he's not there.
*  Not there really.
*  And since he's decided that he's not going to run again, he's gone.
*  He's vanished.
*  Who's running it now?
*  Exactly.
*  And then the crazy thing is Kamala Harris.
*  And then who will be running it then because they really can't see her being in charge.
*  No, it's a figurehead.
*  That's all it is.
*  And what's really wild is the Babylon Bee had a hilarious little caption.
*  They said, when I get in office, I'm going to change things says the woman who's in office
*  right now.
*  She's in office.
*  She's talking about fixing all these things like, hey, you're literally the vice president.
*  From day one, I'm going to really do something about the border.
*  Essentially the president right now.
*  This is so fucking crazy.
*  You'll be the president for five more months.
*  This is so nuts.
*  But yeah, she's flipped on everything except for plastic straws.
*  She still wants to get rid of those.
*  Did you see the thing where Trump came out and said that he was going to stop taxes for tips
*  of hospitality workers and you wouldn't tax them on tips anymore?
*  That was like a month and a half ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And then she came out and said, she's going to do it.
*  She's going to stop tips.
*  And everybody cheered as if it was her idea.
*  But here's the problem.
*  In 2022, she was one of the deciding votes to go after people that were not reporting their tips.
*  Was that on the Inflation Reduction Act or the Green New Deal?
*  Well, I think it was one of the same.
*  She was the tiebreaker.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So they're going to tax the business instead, which in turn taxes the workers that are there.
*  But it's hilarious that two years later, she's acting like this is her idea now.
*  You had a chance.
*  You could have swung it the other way two years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  Could have been right in there.
*  Or that she was the last person in the room when it came to the withdrawal in Afghanistan.
*  We left $87 billion of military equipment there.
*  13 soldiers that were killed.
*  There's still people over there in hiding.
*  Yeah.
*  And also the people that work with us.
*  All the people that work with us.
*  All the translators, all the Afghanis that helped us.
*  They're all fucked.
*  Well, Trump had all that stuff.
*  He was doing it right.
*  He had that meeting that he had with the Taliban leadership.
*  And we're going to leave, but if one soldier's head is touched, we're going to be back.
*  And just to show you how we can do it, here's your address.
*  They had a photograph of his house.
*  Yeah.
*  Gave him to him.
*  And that's when they went, okay.
*  Really, the only thing I liked about Trump was everything that he did.
*  I would cringe at so much stuff that he said.
*  Right.
*  But I think his heart was really in the right place.
*  And not only that, we need a really strong leader like that to deal with these assholes
*  that run the third world, the other world.
*  There's some bad actors out there.
*  Yeah, unquestionably.
*  The wildest thing is that people are pretending that if he gets in the office,
*  he's going to become a dictator, as if he wasn't in office for four years and was never a dictator.
*  The whole thing is like, we're just being gaslit and lied to on a scale that I've never seen in
*  my life to the point where it's CNN on television saying that they support the news becomes a huge
*  laugh or that they just speak the news objectively.
*  Yeah.
*  It's incredible.
*  Like I said, the Democrats are really good at doing it because they say it's so boldface.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they have so much money.
*  The thing, have you ever seen the difference between Democrat donors versus Republican donors?
*  There was a chart that someone made about the amount of people that donate to the Democratic
*  Party versus the amount of people that donate to the Republican Party.
*  It's shocking.
*  Big donors.
*  Big donors.
*  Shocking.
*  That's where it's completely turned upside down.
*  Because it used to be Republicans were known as the fat cats and big oil and big business
*  and all that would be the big supporters and donors of the Republicans.
*  And it was like those five and $10 donations of the Democratic Party because they're really
*  a coalition of groups.
*  But then I think starting with Obama, especially, it started with social media.
*  It really started to get into more of a corporate type of tech oligarchy.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, tech oligarchy.
*  It's a great way to put it.
*  That's really what it is, right?
*  It's a tech oligarchy.
*  The tech thing's nuts because nobody anticipated that these corporations were going to have
*  this insane amount of influence and power over people.
*  I've had this guy Robert Epstein on my podcast before him.
*  I don't know if you've ever seen his work, but he basically does
*  statistical analysis of Google search results and what Google does to change people's opinions
*  and how much of an effect it can have on swaying an election.
*  Because if you go look for Trump rally, you'll see a bunch of Kamala Harris things.
*  If you try to find something negative about Kamala, you'll find all these positive things
*  about Kamala.
*  So these quick searches, which most people do, most people aren't doing deep dives for
*  hours where they're going and reading and finding other alternative sources of information.
*  They get their information from a Google search.
*  And that Google search, if you can curate it and make sure that all the positive stuff
*  about the people that you want is upfront and all the negative stuff about the people
*  you don't want is upfront, you could shift people's opinions by 20, 30%.
*  Of course you can.
*  And it's with the algorithms that they have, they already know your preferences and basically
*  who you are to begin with.
*  And they can maneuver that way.
*  And it should be illegal.
*  It's not just the Russians.
*  We should have search results, which search results should be completely unbiased.
*  Like that should be a law.
*  Because if you can curate searches, if you can curate people's access to information
*  and hide things, that should be illegal.
*  There should be nothing that has anything to do with political ideology when it comes
*  to searching for information.
*  It should just be whatever the information is.
*  I completely agree with you.
*  Well, for one thing, Ronald Reagan said democracy can handle it.
*  And yeah, he testified before the House subcommittee back of the day, House of Un-American
*  Activities, and it said basically just let the communists go ahead and state their causes.
*  It's okay to have a communist party in this country because the exchange of ideas.
*  Everything will play out and democracy can handle it.
*  We're kind of going through with Reagan right now, the movie.
*  We're being, censorship is happening to us through Facebook.
*  They have Facebook banned advertising and a lot of the podcasts.
*  This one will probably be banned on Facebook.
*  As well, over the last couple of months.
*  Really?
*  Just because it's a positive film about Reagan?
*  Is that what the idea is that's bothering them?
*  I see it as it's a biopic is really what it is.
*  It follows him from when he was a boy in Dixon all the way through when he said goodbye to
*  the American people when he was diagnosed for Alzheimer's after he was president.
*  And it's a fight against communism, which he fought all of his life.
*  But the reason being was that the content in it was an attempt to sway an election.
*  A movie.
*  The last time I heard Reagan was on the ballot 40 years ago was the last time.
*  Do you think if you made a positive Obama movie it would be to sway an election?
*  There was an Obama movie that came out during an election year in 2020.
*  Nothing about that.
*  To me, just the act of banning or censoring that material you were talking about is an
*  attempt to sway an election.
*  Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican, by the way.
*  As was Trump.
*  Yeah.
*  Facebook has said they made a mistake.
*  They said that yesterday because we put out a letter to it in an article on Newsweek.
*  They said they made a mistake.
*  It was their automatic systems had detected it.
*  How convenient.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what those automatic systems are, but there was a mistake in that.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't understand it.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know what's going on over there if it's rogue employees.
*  The problem is so many of those people are so ideologically captured.
*  So many of the people that are working for any tech company,
*  they're kids coming out of universities, they're all left-wing.
*  There's very few right-wing people involved.
*  It's a tiny, tiny percentage.
*  They all feel like it's their duty.
*  They feel like they're activists before they're even anything else.
*  To save America.
*  Yeah.
*  From what?
*  Totally drank the Kool-Aid, if you ask me.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's unfortunate about the way Trump talks.
*  Because the way Trump talks, it's easy to make him the enemy
*  because he seems like a mean old rich man.
*  And so in their eyes, that's everything that's wrong in the world.
*  Yes.
*  They'll go after, make fun of you personally or whatever.
*  Yeah, but he didn't prosecute Hillary.
*  You see, he feels like a schoolyard bully or whatever.
*  But all the things they did to Trump, I do believe that when he,
*  as far as revenge and all that stuff, that the success in the election would be his revenge.
*  And I really believe that if it was Biden who was impeached or going to jail or whatever,
*  I think Trump would pardon him.
*  Tell you the truth, I don't think he wants anybody to see a president in jail
*  because that really changes our country.
*  Well, he has said that openly about Hillary.
*  Yeah.
*  When he got into office, there was a lot of people that were pressing him to prosecute her,
*  to go after her for the email thing, for a lot of different things.
*  And he said, no, that'd be a terrible look.
*  It'd be terrible for our country.
*  The wife of the former president of the United States, no way.
*  Yeah.
*  And he didn't do it.
*  So all these things that people think he's going to do,
*  he had the opportunity to do those things four years ago.
*  And they're thinking now they've done so many egregious things to him now
*  with all the prosecutions and then the years and years of Russiagate.
*  Every fucking news network saying something.
*  Yeah.
*  It started a day even before he got into office.
*  But I wasn't, I myself, I wasn't going to vote for Trump this time around.
*  I was wanting them to find another candidate that would kind of calm things down a bit.
*  Right.
*  That's because I thought that's what we needed.
*  We needed to calm things down.
*  But then when they went after him with the judicial system, these stupid charges.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  But that's when things changed for me because then you're messing with the Constitution.
*  Right.
*  And we can't go back from that.
*  Right.
*  After something like that happens.
*  Right.
*  And so that's why I'm jumping in all for Trump.
*  And the other thing is people need to understand that even if you hate Trump,
*  if you normalize weaponizing the judicial system against a political candidate,
*  that can be used against your party too.
*  Exactly.
*  If someone gets in, like if the vague Ramoswami gets in or if Ron DeSantis gets in and he starts
*  doing the same things that they did to Trump, then we have chaos.
*  Yeah.
*  Then we're a fucking banana republic.
*  We're Venezuela where you can go down the line on how that works.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah, it's terrifying.
*  We're like the last hope for this whole idea of this experiment in self-government.
*  Ronald Reagan said that these freedoms that we take for granted, they can be lost in a generation.
*  And I always thought, well, it's kind of really high talk and all that stuff.
*  But it's true.
*  It's true.
*  It's true.
*  These are the craziest times.
*  The craziest.
*  And fascinating, by the way, that I've ever lived in.
*  It makes the 60s look like a sandbox play.
*  Yeah.
*  They're really dead.
*  Well, it's because tech's involved and AI and deepfakes and just so much.
*  So many shenanigans are going on simultaneously.
*  It's just such a bizarre.
*  It's a great time for comedy.
*  So much shit to make fun of because it's almost like the things that are real,
*  they're so funny, they write themselves.
*  It's true.
*  You can't make this stuff up.
*  It's so nuts.
*  The whole thing is so nuts.
*  And the fact that these people are so ideologically captured, they can't recognize the danger of doing
*  the things that they're doing in order to win and that you can't fix that stuff once you put it in motion.
*  And I just don't know how this is going to turn out, but if this was a show,
*  I'd be like, holy shit, what a great show.
*  Like the writing on this show is fucking incredible.
*  No kidding.
*  It's a cliffhanger, this for sure.
*  Yeah, assassination attempt, him going fight, fight, fight,
*  putting his fist out like, what the fuck?
*  Is this real?
*  This is crazy.
*  The whole thing's crazy.
*  And then not a press conference about the shooter.
*  No.
*  Not a press conference.
*  It's like not a month later.
*  How do they do it?
*  Nobody remembers it.
*  Right.
*  Well, they memory hold it.
*  Yeah.
*  Memory hold it.
*  It's like as if it never happened.
*  Well, there was so little reporting on how it happened, how it could have happened,
*  who the shooter was.
*  They get to the kid's house and it's completely scrubbed.
*  He doesn't have any silverware in his home.
*  Like someone was there.
*  Yeah.
*  His phone, it takes him what, a week and a half even to like open it?
*  Oh, we can't get into his phone.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, how about the fact...
*  It's so strange.
*  My son, a 17-year-old son, can get into your phone, but they can't get into your phone.
*  Also the fact that this kid, someone from outside the FBI's office in DC had been visiting.
*  They track the...
*  You know what?
*  They have phone, they have an ad.
*  Oh, right.
*  They can track your phone off that triangulate on the...
*  So there was a phone that was going from outside of DC to this kid multiple times.
*  So what's going on?
*  This kid's training for quite a while, for over a year, it seems like.
*  He was involved in like shooting training and preparing for...
*  He was being briefed.
*  He was there at least like 40 times, they said.
*  I don't know how many times.
*  It was quite a few.
*  It was quite a few.
*  Yeah, but the whole thing is very strange.
*  It's like how is this not like a deep investigation that's on the front page of every newspaper
*  where people are trying to figure out...
*  Outrage from...
*  Was this a government conspiracy to kill the presidential candidate?
*  Yeah.
*  What happened?
*  Right. Was it?
*  Go back to the Kennedy...
*  No, go ahead.
*  I thought the moment he got shot and lived and he goes fight, fight, fight, I'm like,
*  it's over.
*  He's going to win this.
*  Me too.
*  He's going to win this.
*  That's it.
*  Put up his fist like that is like...
*  And then next thing you know, Kamala Harris has one good speech and everybody's cheering.
*  You're like, wow, it's just completely flip-flop.
*  All the talk shows, everyone's with her.
*  A person who just a month prior was being hidden because she would say so many dumb things.
*  Every time she had a talk openly with no script, she would blunder and fuck things up.
*  Now all of a sudden she's the perfect candidate.
*  It's kind of wild.
*  It's super wild.
*  And disenfranchised all those voters who had voted for Biden.
*  If you're talking about democracy, then all of a sudden they have no say about it.
*  No primary.
*  There's no one else gets to choose and they use the FEC filing for Biden's money.
*  So like she gets to access that war chest.
*  So the whole thing's crazy.
*  And the fact that no one's freaking out about the dangers of this.
*  And the fact that this is the first time ever that someone who nobody voted for,
*  nobody voted for in the primaries had zero delegates is now being the person who is at the front.
*  There's a point of head in the polls.
*  Yeah.
*  Allegedly.
*  I always say with the polls, like says who?
*  Here's the thing about polls.
*  Who the fuck are you asking?
*  And who's talking to you?
*  The people that have the least amount to do, the people that are willing to answer polls,
*  the people that when you call them up say,
*  do you have a few minutes of my time?
*  They're like, well, yes, I do.
*  Most people say, get the fuck out of here.
*  And they hang up the phone.
*  The vast majority of people don't answer polls.
*  So you have one point ahead of the people dumb enough to answer polls.
*  Everybody else, it's like we don't know.
*  And so that's why the gaslighting continues.
*  Well, let's put it this way, though.
*  They've done a very good job because they do have the Republicans back on their heels.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And I didn't think it was going to happen.
*  I didn't think so either.
*  I thought, well, leading up to it, I thought he was going to steamroll Biden.
*  The administration has done a terrible job over the last three years.
*  The border is wide open.
*  Everyone's freaking out.
*  There's two wars going on simultaneously that could lead us into World War Three at any moment.
*  Everybody's freaking out.
*  I'm like, when Trump was in office, there was no wars.
*  There was no new wars.
*  There was nothing new that he was doing that was putting people in jeopardy.
*  And then all of a sudden, it was this fucking complete total turnaround orchestrated by the media.
*  And it happened right in front of our eyes.
*  And now Kamala is this darling of everybody.
*  It's like, this is wild.
*  The least popular vice president of all time is now one of the most popular presidential candidates
*  of all time like that.
*  Incredible.
*  And you know, they're going to what we're talking about right now,
*  we're going to sound like conspiracy theorists.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm used to that.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm just getting used to it.
*  I'm super comfortable with it.
*  Super comfortable with it.
*  One of Reagan's greatest phrases, in my opinion, is the nine most terrifying words.
*  I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
*  I'm here to help.
*  It's like it's so true.
*  These people are just like any other person in any position of power.
*  They want to maintain power and they want to make as much money as possible.
*  It's in every corporation.
*  When corporations get in trouble for lying about their products, it's the same thing.
*  It's the same thing in every business.
*  You got to risk management.
*  They show up at the door.
*  It's amazing how the times today are so much like when Reagan was elected.
*  We had inflation out there.
*  We had 20% interest rates.
*  I remember that because I bought a house actually during that time.
*  There was a feeling of malaise in the country that Carter even spoke of.
*  We had hostages in Iran.
*  We have hostages over there in Israel and the Gaza Strip that nobody's even speaking about.
*  How is that possible?
*  Where's the outrage on that?
*  It's so much like that time.
*  Reagan came along and said, we're going this way, that we're not a nation in decline,
*  like we've been told that we are today.
*  And America came back from that.
*  I still have really great faith in the American people when it comes down where the rubber
*  meets the road.
*  I have a great faith in a certain percentage of the American people.
*  There's a certain percentage of the American people.
*  Those are the people who vote.
*  Yeah, I hope so.
*  I think there's a certain percentage of the American people that are living in a movie.
*  They have no real understanding of all the mechanisms that are involved that make this
*  world work and why it's working in the way it's working and what the dangers are of it.
*  There's so many people that are only fed by the mainstream media, which is completely
*  corporate controlled.
*  They don't know what's going on.
*  In a sound bite.
*  That's all it is.
*  Sound bite and headlines.
*  I've been an independent all my life, really.
*  I voted for Carter.
*  I voted for Reagan twice.
*  I voted for Ross Perot.
*  I voted for Clinton once.
*  I voted for Bush once.
*  I voted for Ross Perot too.
*  Yeah, I voted for Obama once.
*  And the second election of that one, I sat out because I just didn't have a choice.
*  But I voted for Trump the first time because they went in there and it was Hillary or Trump.
*  It was Hillary or Trump.
*  And I voted for Trump and voted for him again.
*  I've always believed in the pendulum of politics and culture and the world about what is it
*  that we need right now.
*  And in fact, Republicans and Democrats need each other.
*  They keep each other from going too far one way or the other.
*  And our nation is based on compromise, which winds up being kind of the best way forward.
*  Not everybody gets what they want, but the important stuff, it shakes out in the end.
*  That doesn't seem to be the way things are working right now.
*  Or maybe it is in the overall picture, but I just can't see it.
*  Well, I think what happened was, I don't think in 2016 they ever anticipated that Trump was
*  going to win.
*  All the projections were that Hillary was going to win by a landslide.
*  That was all the polls.
*  That was all the things he saw on television.
*  And then when Trump started winning on television, you could see it in the look of the faces of
*  the pundits, the people that were on TV that were calling the election.
*  They were baffled.
*  They couldn't believe it.
*  And then when it was over, there's that famous video of the lady with the sock hat and the
*  glasses in the street on her knees going, no!
*  You see that?
*  Like when it's announced.
*  Yeah, the glass ceiling still existed.
*  It had not been broken.
*  Oh, it was crazy times.
*  And then what's really funny is right after that, Jim Brewer had a great joke about this,
*  that there was those women march, those marches, because Trump had said that grab him by the
*  pussy thing and be like, he's anti-woman.
*  So there's these women marches.
*  And Jim Brewer goes, isn't it funny?
*  They knew what a woman was then.
*  Which is crazy, because that was only 2016.
*  In 2016, there was no trans women.
*  That kind of conversation was not on the table at all.
*  The Me Too movement.
*  All of that just completely gone out the window in favor of what, 0.000, 0. whatever of the
*  population.
*  I know, it's nuts.
*  And it's also, it's like now women's sports are in peril.
*  Because now you're having biological men with mental disease, mental disorders,
*  competing as women, saying that they're women.
*  Women winning weightlifting events, women winning cycling events.
*  That boxer, the Italian boxer.
*  The boxers are complicated.
*  It's going to be really dangerous.
*  I have nothing against trans people.
*  The boxers are not trans.
*  I was in the drama department.
*  I was a drama mama.
*  Most of the drama department was gay and stuff.
*  It grew up in that way.
*  I used to play golf with Caitlin.
*  When it was Caitlin or Bruce?
*  When he back when he was Bruce.
*  It would just be us, because Sherwood, it was very, there weren't many people around.
*  Just, you know, I love the guy.
*  And I, when he came out like that, I was really happy for him, to tell you the truth.
*  Because to have to like carry that around with what you feel inside, that's really important.
*  But that doesn't mean that the entire nation has to like,
*  flip over and change to accommodate that.
*  Yes, there could be a mall for you.
*  In fact, our system already accommodates everybody.
*  Yes.
*  It does.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  But I just don't like being beat over the head and told what to think and what to feel and
*  to pretend this and pretend that.
*  No, no, it's terrible.
*  It's terrible for everybody.
*  And it's just this very loud vocal minority that's very invested in pushing this agenda.
*  And everybody else is just scratching their heads and going, what the fuck?
*  And if you have a daughter that has to do some sort of a sport,
*  and there's trans athletes on that team, like, Jesus Christ, like,
*  this is the reason why Title Dime was created in the first place,
*  like to give women an opportunity to compete with women.
*  Exactly.
*  Let's say you can't say I feel like a woman, so I'm a woman,
*  and I'm going to compete with women with all the male biological advantages.
*  Like we're, you want to talk about science denying.
*  There's your science denying.
*  Right there.
*  You're denying biological science.
*  Yeah, a man just by his body mass can hit three times harder than a woman.
*  What is...
*  In that Olympic match, I mean, she's, the girl stopped after like 45 seconds.
*  See, that's a different story.
*  That person has a disease.
*  That male boxer who was allegedly male, who's allegedly has XY chromosomes.
*  There's a complicated issue with that.
*  This is like a genetic disorder that this person has,
*  where they have very high testosterone and allegedly have XY chromosome.
*  They should do chromosome.
*  I mean, this is one of the things, do you know what the enhanced games is?
*  I think I know what you're getting at.
*  The enhanced games, they're putting together this new form of athletic competition.
*  It's going to be this enormous event where they're going to let people take
*  performance enhancing drugs.
*  And so I asked them, I had them on the podcast, I said,
*  what are you going to do about trans athletes?
*  They said, I think we're going to go along chromosomes.
*  So if you have XY chromosome, no matter what,
*  you're competing with other people that have XY chromosomes, males,
*  people who grew, went through male puberty.
*  That's it.
*  End of discussion.
*  Now, socially, I'll call you a woman.
*  I'll call you whatever your name you want to be called.
*  I don't care at all.
*  But if you want to compete athletically, we're going to pretend that the shape of the hips,
*  the density of the bones, size of the lungs, size of the heart,
*  the ability to react quicker, all these different advantages that we know exist.
*  This is stupid.
*  And this is now you're putting ideology instead of a head of facts
*  and a head of science and a head of the biological reality
*  we know about the advantages that men have.
*  Yeah.
*  Ideology.
*  It's like, don't look behind the curtain.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like Oz.
*  Don't look over there.
*  It's people that don't have religion is what it is.
*  And they have a new religion.
*  And that religion is this woke ideology.
*  That is they're acting that way the same way a religious zealot would act.
*  Yeah.
*  Complete with the doctrine and everything that goes with it to spout.
*  And there is no argument.
*  Excommunication, everything.
*  There is no exchange of ideas.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, they can't debate because if you debate about it, then the facts outweigh their ideology.
*  You look at the biological facts of this stuff.
*  It outweighs the ideology.
*  And then you look at the transitioning children.
*  Have you ever seen these interviews where people go up to people and they say,
*  do you think that a child of 12 years old is old enough to get a tattoo?
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Do you think they're old enough to know their gender?
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Oh, that.
*  Oh, that.
*  Yeah, okay.
*  Puberty blockers are fine.
*  Literally chemical castration drugs that were used on pedophiles in the past, those are fine.
*  Those are fine to give to kids that are fucking confused.
*  And without telling the parents, too.
*  The whole thing is bananas.
*  Parents having no say about it.
*  I think people in a way do know their gender when they're young.
*  In a way, maybe later they look back and realize that they were that way when they were either
*  gay or from a place of hindsight in a way.
*  But to let someone who was under at least 18 really, I mean even in 18,
*  how much do we really know ourselves?
*  Well, how much are you easily influenced?
*  You can't go back from that.
*  And people are very easily influenced.
*  Very.
*  And if they're taught by the people around them that they get positive reinforcement,
*  if they go in a particular direction, people do that.
*  I mean, how many fucking Hollywood kids, how many people in Hollywood have trans kids?
*  And how is that possible?
*  All of a sudden there's an epidemic of it.
*  How is that possible?
*  Yeah.
*  How is it possible?
*  Is it just the openness that's always been there?
*  Or is it that this is some sort of a fucking mind virus
*  and these people are being influenced by the positive reaction they get
*  from saying that they're LBGTQ2 plus AI, whatever the fuck it is now.
*  It's like there's a social contagion going on.
*  And there's an aspect of that that's real.
*  Yeah.
*  These are educated people.
*  Yeah.
*  We're talking about.
*  Well, that's what's nuts, right?
*  But educated people that are not paying attention to this thing called gender dysphoria
*  that has always existed.
*  How do you think we get back?
*  How do you think we get back to being able to have an exchange of ideas
*  and not just try to put the other one in jail or try to dismiss them from society?
*  It sounds ridiculous, but I think the only way is to do what we're doing right now
*  and to continue talking about it as reasonable people and have people listen to it.
*  And it shapes people's opinions and things.
*  They go, yeah, they're making sense.
*  It is reasonable.
*  And to pretend that these psychological conditions,
*  there's a psychological condition called autogonophilia,
*  where men get sexually aroused dressing up as women.
*  But they're usually attracted to women.
*  So now these men are pretending that they're lesbians.
*  So they're calling themselves lesbians.
*  They're getting on lesbian apps and lesbians are fucked now
*  because now there's these men that are pretending to be lesbian
*  that are occupying these lesbian apps.
*  They've ascended their agenda.
*  And if you don't want to date them, then you're transphobic and they'll attack you.
*  And this is like, holy shit.
*  These are the people that were perverts in the past.
*  And now all of a sudden, they're part of a protected class.
*  It's very strange.
*  It's very strange and it's not good and it's not sustainable.
*  And I don't know when people are going to fully recognize
*  the harm that they've done to all these children
*  that they've had mastectomies and forced these fucking drugs on
*  that killed their body's ability to produce testosterone.
*  And they try to say that they're reversible.
*  There's no fucking reversing damaging someone's puberty.
*  That's not true.
*  If you put puberty blockers in a boy, that is not reversible.
*  It's not true.
*  Not only is it not true,
*  there's a tremendous amount of evidence that shows
*  that there's significant danger to taking those drugs.
*  There's blood clots and strokes and all sorts of other.
*  And then there's the fact that-
*  It's not natural.
*  It's not natural.
*  None of it's natural, right?
*  Even injecting them with estrogen, like to so they could be their true self.
*  If you're your fucking true self, chemicals are not involved.
*  It's not injecting chemicals are not involved in maintaining your true self.
*  That's nonsense.
*  It's a crazy sort of a leap, a mental leap that you have to have to make that.
*  Well, we've got to get back to a place.
*  I mean, looking back at the 60s, and we've always been kind of a nation,
*  at least in this century of experiments that go on as a society as a whole.
*  You had the flower children back then and that whole counterculture.
*  Sure, the weather underground, all that shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Back then, you knew who the leaders were.
*  It seems to be leaderless today.
*  You had either you had Abbie Hoffman, you had the Black Panthers, we had Malcolm X,
*  you knew who Martin Luther King, you had leaders of all these movements
*  that you could have this dialogue with or this debate with.
*  And now it's who are the leaders of Black Lives Matter?
*  Who are the leaders and spokesmen for this whole trans movement that's going on?
*  And some of it is it is political, but where are the leaders for that?
*  Well, I think the leaders are the tech businesses.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's what it is.
*  I think the tech businesses have become a de facto form of government.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  To me, that the only motivation of that could be control.
*  100%.
*  First to control the bottom line of the money, but then the more people that you get
*  have kind of acquiesced control over, the more your bottom line is going to go on.
*  And then it's about power.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think we've been shown in this, getting back to what we were talking about before,
*  that really is what is going on.
*  And what was going on in 2020, if you ask me, with the tech companies deciding to,
*  you know, what we were going to see and what we were going to hear.
*  And it's pretty much exposed.
*  And dangerous.
*  It is dangerous.
*  And we're not prepared for that influence.
*  We didn't know it was going to exist before.
*  There's no laws in place to keep it in check, which is why Google is allowed to curate the
*  search results and why they're allowed to censor conservative voices on social media.
*  And in fact, one of the things we found out, like, thank God for Elon Musk,
*  because if Elon Musk had not bought Twitter, we would not have known the extent
*  of the government's meddling into information distribution.
*  No.
*  Wouldn't have known that they were literally trying to get them to ban legitimate news
*  stories, and they were successful with the Hunter Byron laptop story, but other legitimate
*  conservative perspectives and points of view and people that were legitimate doctors and
*  scientists that had questions about the way we were handling the pandemic.
*  Which also turns out to be true.
*  Yeah, which also 100% turned out to be true.
*  And then when it gets, there is no kind of, okay, we were wrong about this and this, you know,
*  they just kind of dismiss it.
*  I got in a conversation with a guy who was like, well, you know, what about you?
*  These are not ideological issues that you're talking about when it comes to medicine,
*  especially, because everything gets turned into a political.
*  That's what's crazy that vaccines and pharmaceutical drug companies became a
*  democratic liberal perspective, supporting that, like these corporations that have the biggest
*  criminal fines in the history of medicine.
*  It's all these companies, these pharmaceutical drug companies for doing things that were
*  illegal.
*  They were fine billions of dollars, and people still wholesale bought everything they said.
*  And if you disagreed, you were some sort of a fringe conspiracy theorist who was a danger
*  to everyone around you.
*  And right.
*  I know a little bit about that because from when my twins were overdosed when they were
*  12 days old with heparin in a hospital that turned their blood to the consistency of water.
*  And they were off the measurable scale, in fact, for coagulation of their blood for more
*  than 48 hours.
*  And it was the scariest moment of our lives.
*  But really about what I learned about, we did not sue the hospital.
*  It was a, you know, a human error in that.
*  But it was the drug company also, which was kind of liable in that the 10-milligram unit,
*  the 10-unit bottle that the kids were supposed to get was light blue and that the adult was
*  dark blue and that was 10,000.
*  So they got 10,000 three times.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Yeah, it was horrific.
*  But after that, you know, I testified before Congress, the oversight committee there,
*  you know, about what had happened.
*  And as far as the drug companies, it's impossible to sue the drug companies just about.
*  It's very difficult to get them to change anything.
*  They're all located, for the most part, in Illinois.
*  And they have that system wrapped up.
*  But it's, you know, everybody at the FDA, I'm going to say everybody, but there are so many people
*  at the FDA in positions that are either former employees of drug companies or future employees.
*  Future is more likely, right?
*  Because they know there's a golden basket waiting for them at the end of this journey.
*  Exactly.
*  So to get any kind of, you know, that's wrong in itself.
*  And to get anything real done is clouded, you know, by self-interest.
*  Yeah.
*  So what happened during COVID was that there's still these boys that are dropping dead.
*  Seventeen of heart attacks.
*  People don't trust their government anymore.
*  And that's not the same it was back in the late 70s before that election.
*  People didn't, since Watergate hadn't trusted their government.
*  What's bizarre to me is that even with all the evidence of these people dropping dead,
*  the people that are around the people dropping dead are in denial about it.
*  Because they all advocated for a very specific thing.
*  And when that very specific thing may be causing a bunch of deaths,
*  they don't want to take credit for it.
*  They don't want to be in trouble for it.
*  They don't want to be beholden to this idea that they had, the pharmaceutical drug companies
*  were telling you the truth and that this is the only way out of this.
*  And if you didn't do it, we're all going to die.
*  And everybody went into this with this terrible fear.
*  And because they stated that early, now they're committed to it.
*  And they're defending it because it's a part of themselves.
*  Their ideas are a part of themselves.
*  And so you're seeing like the, if you look at the, just if you look at what insurance companies
*  are dealing with now with excess deaths, that's some of the best data that we have.
*  There's excess mortality.
*  Right.
*  And the excess mortality is extraordinary.
*  At any other time in history, if there was a thing that was rolled out
*  where all of a sudden everybody's taking it and all of a sudden you have
*  this amazing increase in excess deaths and cancers that are what they're calling turbo cancer.
*  And if you listen to Peter McCullough, he explains how this could be causing that,
*  that the mRNA vaccines could be causing these turbo-cancer.
*  Because it actually changes our molecular structure down to the chromosomes and the DNA.
*  It's a man-made thing, which is affecting our body in a bad way.
*  And it's killing people that took it, that were advocating for it, that were tech people.
*  There's tech people that are dropping dead left and right.
*  And they're still on this bandwagon.
*  And they're still letting the CDC saying you should vaccinate anyone under 12.
*  Like what the fuck are you talking about?
*  Right.
*  What are you talking about?
*  This is insane.
*  It was never dangerous for kids.
*  My kids got it and they were over it in a couple of days.
*  It was nothing.
*  Yeah, I got the vaccine twice.
*  I had to when we were doing Reagan.
*  We were shooting the movie.
*  So it was still at that point and it was required in order to work.
*  Did you have any side effects?
*  No, but you know, I do know and I actually got COVID when we were shooting Reagan.
*  During the assassination scene actually.
*  Oh really?
*  Yeah.
*  No way.
*  We were working in a basement and we had like 50 extras, you know, and it was just,
*  of course it did.
*  Just about everybody got it.
*  But I had a bad, I was lucky it hit me in the guts instead of the lungs.
*  And I had 104 temperature for a couple of nights.
*  But you know, I was over it in a couple of weeks.
*  And then, you know, getting the vaccine, I did have kind of a reaction to that.
*  Like a little mini version.
*  But I've noticed that when I get a cold now, it's harder to get over.
*  Everything is a little bit harder to get over now.
*  And I don't think it's just me.
*  I have friends, you know, we talk about it and the same thing is going on.
*  And you know, it coming from China and all that, you know, what could have happened
*  is could have been an exchange, a real exchange of how it had really happened.
*  And what the process was of how it happened to make sure that it doesn't happen again
*  or during the research of the vaccine to put that out where it could have helped there as well.
*  There's no, it just winds up being, you know, everybody lines up on the
*  side of ideology.
*  Exactly.
*  I mean, I wonder, you know, if Trump does come into office, are they going to say,
*  oh, I won't take Trump's vaccine again?
*  Well, that's how it was.
*  That's why I was.
*  Even Kamala Harris is saying that.
*  Yeah, she was saying, I'm not going to take his vaccine when it comes out.
*  Then as soon as they got into office, the very same vaccine, they said, yes,
*  we should take our vaccine.
*  Yeah, it's nuts.
*  Yeah, very bizarre.
*  That's one of the things that's so interesting because we have more access to information now
*  than we've ever had in all of human history.
*  And yet people are more divided by ideology than they are by facts than any other time in history.
*  A lot of it has to do, I think, with cable news, too.
*  People have, you know, separated themselves.
*  I myself, I watch all of them.
*  You know, on on DirecTV, there's Channel 200 where you got like six boxes.
*  You can watch all the news and it flipped back and forth.
*  And it's like watching a different story.
*  Right.
*  A completely different story.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't know where you're going.
*  Somewhere in the middle there is the real thing.
*  One of my favorite moments was when Joy Reid was comparing Biden getting COVID and
*  to Trump getting shot.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, yeah, he got over COVID.
*  Right.
*  He got over COVID.
*  No, he got over 20, 24 COVID, which is basically a fucking cough.
*  Yeah.
*  And Reagan, I mean, excuse me, Trump got shot in the fucking head.
*  Yeah.
*  It only grazed his ear.
*  But that was just a miraculous turn of the head.
*  Yeah.
*  The exact right moment.
*  Incredible.
*  Which is another thing.
*  Maybe shrapnel, actually.
*  Is that what they think?
*  Maybe it kicks up and dust up.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just starting something new.
*  Well, it was a literal photo of the bullet passing by his head.
*  Yeah.
*  But there were a lot of people that denied that he even got shot.
*  They were saying, oh.
*  Actually, there was three that came very close to him.
*  Yes.
*  There's a second one on the left side of his head.
*  One was just an inch away from that one, too.
*  Yeah.
*  And man, if his head had blown up there in front of everybody, what would be the situation?
*  Civil War.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It could have very well been Civil War.
*  I'm afraid it could have been.
*  Yeah.
*  Those Trump people would have fucking loaded up their pickup trucks.
*  Do you think they would have done a more thorough investigation now?
*  If he had?
*  No, because that's, listen, this is Lee Harvey Oswald all over again, but less complicated,
*  or actually more complicated, right?
*  Because this is a very young kid.
*  How did they get to him?
*  We don't know anything about him.
*  We don't know why he was willing to do this.
*  We don't know.
*  We also know he's a registered Republican, which is crazy.
*  Well, you know, one could be swayed from that, too.
*  Sure.
*  Sure.
*  Especially at 20.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like who fucking knows what happened?
*  And they're going to have to get another Republican in there.
*  Just, you know, but yeah, I've been reading this unspoken.
*  I've forgotten the author's name, but it was endorsed by RFK Jr.
*  about the assassination of his uncle, the President John Kennedy.
*  And it takes every piece of information that is known and puts it in a book and tells a story
*  from it.
*  And it was our government, I think, that killed Kennedy.
*  And through the CIA, the dark forces within our government.
*  And if that can happen, then how about today?
*  Of course.
*  Yeah.
*  Sure.
*  Who's running things?
*  The only thing you can draw is, conclusion you can draw is it's got to be something like that.
*  Only I can't understand why the CIA would want us out of Afghanistan that way or, you know,
*  why all the other stuff is going on.
*  But I guess, again, that's for control.
*  Yeah, it's for control.
*  But it's also so multi-layered and so hard to figure out what's going on.
*  I mean, we know that they had MKUltra in the 1960s.
*  They did mind control experiments on people.
*  And the idea that they just stopped that is silly.
*  That's silly.
*  They went further.
*  That's how we got all those other drugs that were turned up at parties, right?
*  Well, it's part of it.
*  What was that, this guy, Norman Oehler, he wrote about drugs during the Third Reich
*  and about how they experimented with LSD on concentration camp prisoners.
*  Yeah.
*  And all the stuff that they were giving Hitler, like while he was in the middle,
*  and all the stuff they were giving the Nazis.
*  They were giving the Nazis meth.
*  Yeah.
*  They were all on meth.
*  It was crystal meth, in fact, that they were so fanatical and going out there and staying up
*  for days.
*  Yeah.
*  That was essential to the blitzkrieg.
*  Yes.
*  You can't stop and take a nap over that.
*  Yeah, three days on meth.
*  You've got to keep on rolling down the road like a trucker.
*  Wild, out of their fucking minds.
*  And Norman was explaining that they had different levels of meth that they would give to the people
*  at the front lines.
*  Like the guys that ran the tanks had the most meth.
*  So they were just jacked out of their fucking minds, just storming through the night.
*  And then the French were drinking wine.
*  They're just like hanging out drinking.
*  They got like a liter of wine, a three quarters of a liter of wine a day as a ration.
*  So they're drunk in the streets.
*  And then the Nazis come through on meth, which is a way better drug for war.
*  Yeah.
*  They just went right past that Maginot Line like nothing flat.
*  Fucking nuts.
*  Really crazy.
*  Nuts.
*  Three days through Poland.
*  The whole thing is insane.
*  But that they took that knowledge from the Nazis and they started applying it.
*  And then they started using some of those drugs and using these MK Ultra experiments.
*  And the idea that they stopped that and they don't do that now.
*  Well, what happened with this kid?
*  Did they do an autopsy?
*  Did they find there's any chemicals in this kid's body?
*  We don't know.
*  We haven't heard a fucking peep.
*  We have not heard a single press conference.
*  The first thing that I would have done, but besides like try to figure out how the fuck
*  this kid was on the roof for 30 minutes without anybody doing anything.
*  How he got a rifle there, how he got a ladder there, how the snipers didn't shoot him,
*  how they didn't go up there and take him out before this happened.
*  Secret Service was supposed to be in those windows.
*  I mean, they had a fantastic look at him.
*  Yeah.
*  But they were downstairs drinking coffee or whatever the hell they were doing.
*  Not only that, a lot of those people were Department of Homeland Security.
*  They weren't even Secret Service agents.
*  They weren't even lined up.
*  And who runs the Department of Homeland Security?
*  Don't think that's...
*  The Biorcus.
*  It's nuts because I would have wanted to know what that kid was on.
*  I guarantee there was some sort of psychotropic medicine involved.
*  There was something involved.
*  I do not think if you're going to...
*  Let's assume that someone trained him, told him how to do this.
*  Let's assume this wasn't a young 20-year-old kid with very sophisticated detonators and remote
*  controls and all these different things that we know that he possessed.
*  He had this rifle, brought the rifle onto the roof.
*  Also, why did he have iron sights?
*  That's baffling to me.
*  Who was his gun instructor?
*  There were a lot of federal officers over there who went to training.
*  I'm not saying that any of them were like the ones...
*  They probably had no idea what he was going to do.
*  Anybody in this country, we have the Second Amendment.
*  Anyone can go and learn how to shoot a gun.
*  There's courses you can take.
*  I've taken them.
*  You can go and learn how to shoot guns.
*  Exactly.
*  You wind up having a mentor with things like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Probably.
*  You learn how to fight box.
*  You wind up having somebody who becomes your mentor.
*  Yes.
*  And that's how you get indoctrinated into...
*  Right. Where's that guy?
*  Where is that guy?
*  Yeah.
*  The kid was really smart.
*  He won all the science fairs, from what I understand.
*  So he was very adept at all that.
*  But to get into the...
*  There's still some stuff, supposedly, that's encrypted that they can't touch.
*  Sources over to Europe or whatever they're saying.
*  And I don't know what I'm talking about with that because it's only been inferred.
*  What are they doing?
*  Why are they not...
*  Why is it just inferred?
*  Why are they not still on it like a daily thing with nightline daily reports about it?
*  Why didn't they test his blood?
*  Why didn't they tell us whether or not he was on any kind of medication?
*  Were they ties to Iran or to China or to Russia or to Venezuela?
*  How is it just memory hold?
*  It's crazy.
*  The whole thing is crazy.
*  And then there's allegations of second gunmen,
*  which is always the case with any kind of assassination.
*  The thing that would have been horrific if he had successfully shot Trump,
*  if he killed him and then they killed him, that would have been it.
*  It would have no idea what happened and they probably would have memory hold it all the
*  exact same way they did it now.
*  And then they would have said, the country has to heal and move on.
*  Right.
*  There are long national nightmares over language like that.
*  What if the kid had just been wounded?
*  I don't think he would have made it to jail alive.
*  They weren't going to move.
*  They had a clear shot on that.
*  I'm just amazed that they let him get off those shots.
*  That's just the craziest thing to me that they knew he was there.
*  I'm going to see him running across the roof while Trump is speaking.
*  He had a fucking range finder.
*  Yeah, like using golf.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  They were quite good.
*  He was an archery.
*  He wanted to know what the yardage was so he could hold for a particular height.
*  But I don't understand the iron sights thing.
*  The only thing that makes me…
*  What are iron sights?
*  Okay, so rifles either have a scope, which is a magnification scope,
*  which is extremely accurate, but you have to adjust it.
*  Or they can have iron sights and iron sights are like, oh, you have a pistol.
*  You have a pistol, there's two forks in the back.
*  Exactly.
*  Those are called iron sights.
*  Yes.
*  I thought he did have a scope.
*  He didn't have a scope.
*  I don't believe he did.
*  See if that's been proven because there's a photograph of the gun
*  and the gun, it looks very clear from the photograph that it does not have a scope on it.
*  Scope is, you know, it's a large tube that sits on the top of the rifle
*  and you have to adjust that scope.
*  It takes a little doing to even attach that.
*  Does it not?
*  I mean, some can click in, but I would imagine you really have to…
*  It's not that complicated.
*  You could do it and then you would need to go to a range and sight it in.
*  The problem with a scope would be that if things are getting jostled around and knocked around,
*  if you bang the scope on something, it can get moved just a fraction of a millimeter
*  to the left or to the right and then your zero point at whatever he's got it zeroed at,
*  if it's a hundred yards or 150 yards, it's going to be off.
*  The distance will get further away.
*  Yes.
*  So you have to probably redo it.
*  I've had personal experience with that.
*  I was on a deer hunt.
*  I fell with a rifle and I fell going up a snowy slope
*  and the rifle got banged and my scope was off by like six inches at a hundred yards.
*  But that was because my scope wasn't tightened.
*  Somebody had not tightened it down properly.
*  I could see how maybe you would say iron sights because it's not that far of a shot.
*  Because I've practiced with the iron sights.
*  I know the iron sights.
*  It's one factor you can take out that is not going to be a variable.
*  Exactly.
*  With some competition shooters, the old school guys, they don't like red dots because they want
*  to use iron sights because it's so reliable.
*  As long as you can line it up correctly, as long as you have proper technique and you're
*  accustomed to it, it's not going to move.
*  It's not going to go left or right.
*  And you can actually see everything around you even better than looking through a scope.
*  If you're looking through a scope, you get magnification.
*  So you can put that crosshair right on his face.
*  And then 150 yards with a magnification and a scope that's on, that's an easy shot.
*  It's very easy, especially in a prone position like he was on top of a roof.
*  But there's so many questions.
*  How the fuck did they let him do that?
*  How did they let him get up there?
*  What kind of security breach is involved?
*  And how about the lady who was in charge of Secret Service?
*  She didn't want to step down.
*  Yeah.
*  They're questioning her.
*  The whole thing is insane.
*  She didn't even go to the site.
*  Even a week later, she went before Congress to explain some things and she hadn't even
*  been to the site.
*  It's bonkers.
*  The guy, the head agent not being fired, it's like he wasn't available for comment because
*  he's still running the investigation.
*  This is the guy who's responsible for all this happening and he's the one that's running
*  the investigation.
*  Are you out of your mind?
*  The whole thing's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  And it's going to be a footnote in history that people are going to be baffled by.
*  Just like they're baffled by the JFK assassination.
*  Well, because he wasn't killed and his head didn't blow up in front of on national television,
*  it's just that.
*  It's just a footnote.
*  It's not like they got him missed.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all I could say.
*  I know.
*  They got him missed.
*  Who knows what would have happened to the country?
*  So there's the gun.
*  So I'm looking at that gun right now and that gun to me looks like it has iron sights.
*  This is why I say that.
*  You see the handle at the bottom, you see the magazine.
*  So the handle is in the front.
*  That's the magazine where you're at.
*  Further one forward and the one behind it, that's the handle.
*  And then you see above, those are iron sights.
*  So there's no scope on it.
*  And last, that thing.
*  Kind of as far as regular sight scope, those are a little bigger than the regular sighting on a rifle.
*  It's an AR.
*  Okay.
*  It's an AR rifle.
*  So maybe that's a red dot.
*  Maybe it's a very miniature red dot.
*  You mean they're in the middle above the magazine?
*  But it doesn't look like it.
*  It looks like...
*  That's not a scope.
*  Someone on that picture said that the iron sights were set up at a 90 degree angle so
*  like it could be shot from prone, so like sideways.
*  You know, it was amazing.
*  Well, it's hard to say.
*  I mean, you had the cops carrying the rifle down the hallway so everybody,
*  the whole public could see it.
*  The murder weapon.
*  Right.
*  And, you know, this is what Americans have gotten used to.
*  They've gotten used to the idea that we're not allowed to see information
*  that we have a right to see as a public.
*  This country is supposedly, we're the boss, the people are.
*  And we deserve information so that we can make a decision about it.
*  Yeah.
*  Or we can have the people that we've elected make a decision about it by giving them
*  the power to do so, given to them by us.
*  Right.
*  And now we get information that's either distorted or it's fake or it's just withheld.
*  And, you know, withheld and like that's just the way things are.
*  People have gotten used to that idea.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's how we lose our country and our republic.
*  Right.
*  That's how we lose it.
*  Yeah.
*  See, Google whether or not there's a definitive answer as to whether or not he had iron sights.
*  I can't.
*  I can't.
*  I found nothing.
*  That's so crazy that we don't know.
*  I don't know where to look either, but I didn't find any updates.
*  Just Google this.
*  Did the Trump shooter have a scope on his rifle?
*  100%.
*  Did Thomas Crook's rifle have a scope?
*  And what does it say?
*  There's no, I mean, I have nothing.
*  I would have found the answer and didn't wait.
*  From people that I've talked to.
*  They always kind of portray it, you know, in the coverage after it was kind of,
*  at least at first, portrayed as like a rifle with a scope in a couple of places.
*  I thought it did have a scope, but.
*  It's possible that it is a very small miniature scope, but like a red dot,
*  like on a pistol, generally doesn't have magnification.
*  It's just the dot.
*  What was he doing with the, here's another question.
*  Those explosive devices, I think, which were in the car.
*  Yeah.
*  What were they for?
*  Right.
*  And how did he learn how to do that?
*  Like, where do you get those when you're 20 years old?
*  When you're 20 years old, you know, like I said, he won science fairs.
*  I think he was quite adept at getting that info.
*  Well, wouldn't we know that this kid had Google search how to use explosive devices
*  and figured out how to get the detonators, figured out how to wire it, how he learned.
*  We don't know anything.
*  Sure.
*  We don't know anything about this kid.
*  Fertilizer bomb and all that.
*  What were they for?
*  Right.
*  What were they for?
*  He had to have an intent for that.
*  Right.
*  And you can figure it out even though he's not here.
*  You could figure out an intent.
*  You know, certainly he wouldn't get away.
*  Otherwise, he would have had him on him.
*  Right.
*  Do you think he thought he was going to survive?
*  I mean, was it a suicide run for this kid?
*  That's why I want to know what drugs was he on.
*  We don't have any toxicology report on this kid.
*  Right.
*  Which is crazy.
*  That is crazy.
*  They have it for every school shooter.
*  Yeah. The people are entitled to go.
*  Jim Belushi died and they told everybody his toxicology report within three weeks for it to come back.
*  It's because he died of it, right?
*  Yeah, but still.
*  I'm still.
*  I'm talking about the right to privacy versus the public's right to know.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, in this particular situation, the right to know is imperative.
*  Is there something that was given to this kid that made him do something that insane?
*  Because there are things that they can give you that will
*  completely distort your understanding of reality, which is why they gave the Nazis meth.
*  This is the whole reason for it, because you would do wild shit when you're hopped up on amphetamines.
*  Yeah. You can give somebody clomapin and start this anxiety and you don't know whether you're
*  you could make one decision one minute and angst about it the next and be very influenced.
*  Also, the idea that we know all the psychotropic drugs that the government is experimenting on,
*  that's ridiculous too.
*  I experimented with them a couple of times.
*  What would you think?
*  Not all of them. Since 1990, they got some stuff coming out now.
*  Well, you got off the cocaine train at the exact right time,
*  because now you're literally rolling the dice with fentanyl.
*  Yeah, fentanyl.
*  It hasn't always been like this, the way you and I are talking.
*  And it's been a very, very long time since it seems that common sense
*  prevailed in the end in this country.
*  And I so want it back.
*  I'm not even talking about having everything go the way I want it to go.
*  To get back to a time when whoever was in the White House, and at least we were a people
*  that could at least agree 70% of the time.
*  And I think we are a people that agree 70% of the time as a whole.
*  But that's impossible now.
*  Right. We're being manipulated too much.
*  And most people are just not savvy enough to understand the effect of this manipulation,
*  which is I think that's a big factor we're experiencing.
*  There's just a lot of people that aren't even aware of all the things that we're talking about.
*  There's a lot of people out there that think, oh, Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
*  Lone gunman, crazy guy.
*  Well, I thought that for a very long time myself.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. After about 12, 15 years, it started to sound like conspiracy theories to me and stuff.
*  And then I completely switched over again, because of evidence really that's coming out.
*  I really want to see the rest of the files.
*  And why are they not releasing the files?
*  I know Trump released a bunch of them, but I guess there's people living that.
*  Well, there's also the complete erosion of faith in the intelligence agencies.
*  If it turns out that the CIA did kill JFK, or that they were involved in the killing of JFK,
*  and it could be proven, which is what Tucker Carlson's been saying.
*  If that is the truth, that would throw the whole country into a tailspin.
*  We wouldn't know what the fuck to do.
*  Because if you really found out that in 1963, they organized an assassination on the president,
*  pulled it off, killed him, lied to the public, published this bullshit Warren Commission report,
*  tried to pass off this nonsense of the magic bullet, all that stuff.
*  John Foster Dulles, who ran the CIA, they just pulled off one a month before with DM in South
*  Vietnam. He was assassinated, and Kennedy was shot. And then the Warren report,
*  the head of the CIA was the head of the...
*  Yeah, Alan Dulles.
*  Alan Dulles of the... I said John Foster. Alan Dulles was the head of the Warren Commission.
*  Which is nuts, because Kennedy had fired him.
*  Yeah, had fired him because he was doing things behind his back.
*  And so then that guy becomes the head of the Warren Commission report,
*  and then Gerald Ford, also on the Warren Commission report, then takes over when
*  Nixon gets kicked out of office. And then you find out through... I mean, Tucker Carlson explained
*  it to us that the whole Nixon thing was essentially an FBI, CIA op to get Nixon out of office. And
*  Nixon was apparently very interested in finding out who had shot JFK.
*  Yeah. And also the Vietnam War that was going on. The CIA was very... In fact, that's kind of where
*  it started, along with the Bay of Pigs, which Kennedy inherited that was an operation going on.
*  But the Cuban Missile Crisis was another one. Kennedy having actually a secret dialogue with
*  Khrushchev that was going on that I guess today they would call collusion. I don't know. But
*  they were making great progress in that. But Vietnam, he had gotten the Russians to agree to
*  make Laos a neutral country in that. And we had American GIs even before it was an actual war,
*  which it never was, but getting killed over there. And Kennedy was wanting to
*  do the same thing with Vietnam, have it be a neutral country, and was making progress with
*  Khrushchev in a way towards that. But the CIA's involvement over there, they openly, and
*  with the Joint Chiefs in meetings, Kennedy had lost control of the Joint Chiefs and
*  in decisions that were being made there. They were totally going against him. And I
*  believe too that it was the CIA that took him out because of their agenda and the mood that was in
*  the country. It's crazy. The whole thing's crazy. It's crazy to look back on it and think about it.
*  And even the fact that we know now for a fact that the Golftankan incident was a false flag,
*  which is what got us into Vietnam in the first place, and that no one went to jail for that.
*  Yeah. When Johnson came in, I don't think Johnson was involved in the assassination of Kennedy,
*  but when Johnson did come in, he had a different kind of bend on that and said,
*  you guys will get your war right after the election, is what he told the Joint Chiefs,
*  because they really wanted it. And lo and behold, after he was elected, then the
*  Golftankan incident happens and away you go. Yeah, it's wild. And then we're dealing with
*  a more sophisticated, much better concealed version of that apparatus right now.
*  Yes. That's what this book really got me to thinking. Okay, if all this was going on then,
*  how much more sophisticated is it now? Right. Especially after 9-11, when we just handed them
*  the keys to be able... The CIA was created by Truman. They haven't just been around,
*  it was created by Truman and they were supposed to be, do you act as foreign agents in other
*  countries? And they were basically given, like James Bond, license to kill and do what... Also,
*  the license to lie before Congress, they were given to keep things secret as they could.
*  And Truman came to, like not even a year after he'd created it, came to regret it,
*  that he'd even created that office because of... It turns into a government, within a government,
*  that is deciding, that has its fingers in every pie, especially the military.
*  Dangerous place. Kennedy himself was, wanted to get rid of the CIA, in fact. And so,
*  later after 9-11, we just really gave them the keys to the kingdom because they were,
*  you're allowed in the homeland to do the same thing.
*  And then the Patriot Act and NDAA, all those different things that gave them the ability
*  to spy on people and then what we found from Edward Snowden about the NSA and all of it.
*  It's just wild stuff, man. And most people aren't even aware of it. That's really crazy.
*  Yeah, I mean, go to what we were told about with Iraq before we went in there and the weapons of
*  mass destruction and the like, which everybody believed, no matter what side you were on.
*  It's pretty crazy. And it's literally what Truman was warning everybody about when he left office.
*  Yeah.
*  That famous speech about the military industrial.
*  Well, that was Eisenhower.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Yeah, Eisenhower came in and gave that same speech and had a meeting with Kennedy about
*  beware the military industrial establishment.
*  Especially Eisenhower because he was such a respected person. So for him to say that,
*  but it was one of those things that you say it on television, people hear it, and then you never
*  saw it again because it wasn't the time where there was the internet. It wasn't, there was no
*  one watching that clip on YouTube saying, what the fuck is he saying?
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah. Well, Kennedy's speech at the American university, which was about peace and about
*  the Soviet Union and the United States, learning to live together. In fact, the test ban treaty
*  came out of that, which was hardly covered in the news actually back then, because everybody
*  was so pro-war. I mean, I grew up, we were getting under our school desk.
*  Yep.
*  Like at least once every two weeks in case of a nuclear war, it was going to happen.
*  I lived within the circle of zone in Houston there that the Cubans were going to send
*  the missiles. I got kept home from school. It was happening.
*  We lived with that until Reagan, the Pope, and like Valenza, along with Margaret Thatcher,
*  ended the Cold War. But I digress.
*  I remember those days. I remember those days in school where they would make you do drills
*  and they would play videos showing you how to get under your desk.
*  Yeah.
*  That's going to protect you from a nuclear bomb.
*  Yeah.
*  A desk?
*  Yeah.
*  We were terrified. We grew up with an existential fear of a nuclear war with Russia.
*  Yeah. It was real. There was about a 90% chance that it was going to happen,
*  especially during the 60s. Then again, with the Carter administration,
*  into Reagan because we'd appeased them. We'd given away so much and they were building
*  their military up. It really was like a chess game, but there was a hawk, the pro-war,
*  survivability after a nuclear attack was a big topic.
*  Yeah.
*  Sure. Let's talk to Strangelove.
*  Like Curtis LeMay, one of the Joint Chiefs, who was a big admiral during World War II and
*  ran the Pacific campaign basically. He was saying, well, we could survive this. 50 million people,
*  yes, will be killed, but we will survive. Survive to what? That was the mentality.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  That's how much they wanted to defeat communism.
*  Right. It's literally a comedy in Dr. Strangelove, him explaining that.
*  Yes.
*  It's literally a comedy because people are like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  I encourage anybody to watch that movie.
*  Florida-dation Mandrake.
*  Yeah. It's crazy. They were like, well, we might lose 50 million people. We'll be okay. We'll still
*  have 100. We might lose a third of the country because back then that was probably the population,
*  right? It was probably 150 million.
*  It was about 150 million back then. We saw a third.
*  A third? No big deal.
*  Yeah. Strangelove is such a great movie to still watch. They had the tunnels they had
*  built ahead of time. I think it was like eight females to one male.
*  So we could continue to make babies, repopulate the earth.
*  So we could repopulate very quickly.
*  What the fuck? How about no war, guys? How about that? Is that possible? Is it possible
*  to just fucking make friends with everybody? Jesus Christ, can't we all get along? It's a big ass
*  world. Is there a way to do this without killing hundreds of millions of people, you fucking idiots?
*  Rodney King actually, he was right. Can't we all just get along? That's the first thing that comes
*  up in my mind these days.
*  Yeah. Can't we all just get along? Yeah.
*  Isn't that nuts? Rodney King, Voice of Reason.
*  Yeah.
*  Voice of Reason.
*  And Ronald Reagan.
*  Well, yeah.
*  Ronald Reagan, if you listen to his speeches today, he's incredibly reasonable. I mean, we
*  were told, like I grew up in a very liberal household and Reagan was the bad guy. Like
*  everybody hated Reagan, trickle down economics, it's bad for the country, it's a bunch of greedy
*  people. War monger.
*  Yeah. Let them control the country. You listen to him talk now. One of the great speeches he gave
*  in front of the UN, it really got all the crazy UFO conspiracy theories. Those guys went nuts
*  because he said how quickly we would put aside our differences if we were faced from an alien
*  threat from outside this world. It's a great perspective because it's so true.
*  It's so true. We can come together like that.
*  Yeah. And we should be a community on a planet. And it is possible in an alternative universe with
*  different circumstances that we could have evolved into a community. And it's possible,
*  I think, in the future. If big tech and these ideologies don't get ahold of us, we can
*  communicate as individuals and realize that most of our differences are bullshit. And most of what's
*  going on is the battle of control over resources. And if instead human beings had the ability to
*  communicate with each other and have real true access to information and know exactly what's
*  going on and be able to relay what their concerns and needs are, most people just want to be happy.
*  Instead of keeping secrets. Yes.
*  It's the keeping of secrets from them. It's us and them. I mean, Kennedy himself was,
*  he wanted for the Russians, the Soviets, to join our space program and do a joint venture to send
*  a man to the moon. That's where he'd come to. This was during the test ban treaty because,
*  you know, it's the rocket secrets and all the rest of that stuff. Can you imagine putting
*  their minds and our minds together and doing this as a joint venture? There'd have to be
*  relinquishing of secrets because it's military. That's why, of course, they wouldn't allow that
*  to happen. But once you start doing that and having that shared technology without keeping
*  secrets from each other, that's where people and nations do come together because
*  we don't mistrust each other because we're armed. We're armed because we mistrust each other.
*  Right. Right.
*  And that's what Reagan said to Gorbachev in Vienna, which got the conversation going.
*  Well, now there's the same conversations going on right now with AI
*  because AI weaponry and the ability to have weapons that don't rely at all on human interaction.
*  No people making decisions or pressing buttons completely powered by AI. If that happens,
*  this is a very, very dangerous situation. Again, Dr. Stringslove down there. No morals, no ethics.
*  And this mad race is, again, this is the height of tech, right? Because you have tech people that are
*  communicating about things to Congress where the people that are asking the questions really have
*  no understanding of what these guys are doing or what's really possible and what's capable.
*  There's problems because they lose information. Information gets stolen
*  and they're dealing with that right now. They think that China has access to the top level AI
*  that we're producing right now. There's a real concern about that.
*  And where do those attacks really come from sometimes? Are you even concerned about that?
*  Is it Korea? Is it China or whatever? Because you can mask all that. But yeah, AI does scare me.
*  But then, you know, it's called progress and there is no going back from progress.
*  No, it's what we do.
*  We just got to keep up. We really got to keep up now.
*  How do you keep up with that though? That's the question.
*  Everything happened so much faster that they had a little, they had a kind of a running start with
*  the nuclear bombs, you know, and that because it took a while to develop over time. And now
*  things come along so quickly. And, you know, the more we know, the more we can know.
*  And it's a scary world.
*  So is the reluctance that people have to allow, like the resistance against this Reagan film,
*  do you think it's resistance about conservatism in general? Or is it the idea that you're going to
*  change people's perceptions about history? Because there's a lot of people, again,
*  that have this very peripheral, low information view of who Reagan was. And so they want to have
*  this negative spin on Reagan in history because he's a conservative.
*  I think, you know, Reagan was a great president. And I think it gets perceived compared to Trump,
*  because there are comparisons to Trump and the things that if you get down to policy,
*  there's a really good comparison to Trump. And maybe they see this as influencing an election
*  by, you know, by that comparison or whatever. But, you know, it's the free society here. It's
*  about ideas we're able to express and we're able to like, make up your own mind about it,
*  rather than deciding for people about what it was. And the Reagan movie is, it's not about ideology
*  at all. I mean, Reagan was a Democrat for 40 years until the last 40 years of his life, or 35,
*  he was a Republican. And it's about the Cold War and about his fight against communism. And,
*  you know, we won the Cold War under Reagan. And it was before that appeasement had been practiced
*  in this country. Jimmy Carter, God bless him, you know, he did really well with the Egyptians
*  and Israel in making peace in the Middle East. It was great about that. He wasn't so great with
*  the Iran hostage thing. You remember the foiled disastrous rescue attempt back then. It seemed like
*  everything failed. But with the Soviets, he had appeased it like, you know, gave away the B-1 bomber,
*  he gave away a lot of things without getting anything in return from the Soviets as far as
*  reducing the threat of war. And they took that, of course, as weakness and started to really build up
*  their military to and their missile strength to an unprecedented level. Americans were,
*  there's a lot about Americans that it's kind of sweet in a way. And that, you know, the Kumbaya
*  thing, you know, why can't all, why can't we be friends and just get out of that humanity?
*  That's the good hearted, fantastic thing about America. But that's not the way the world works.
*  We're all a product of the way that we grew up. We've basically grown up in this country with
*  relative safety. And we have, you know, a nation that has had laws that, you know, form of law.
*  And you do things the right way and the wrong way, which you consider. But, you know, can you imagine
*  what it was like for Saddam to grow up in Iraq or Chi or Putin and the way they grew up that makes
*  them the way they are? And the Russians people had grown up the same way. So you start to get a sense
*  of how the rest of the world doesn't operate on the same rules that we are. They actually have a
*  more realistic way of looking at things, the way man has actually been from the tribal stage on.
*  You know, you got the water and we want the water. We don't want to share it. We want it ours.
*  Because you'll piss in it and it'll destroy it. So we want it for ourselves. And, but Reagan
*  came along and, you know, he had the idea to bankrupt them, to make them spin. Star Wars,
*  he came out with Star Wars. He really got that name from the movie, the whole Star Wars thing,
*  which is now the Patriot defense system over in Israel. It didn't exist at that time. It was
*  decades away from it. But he made the Russians think at least 10% that it might be real.
*  Reagan even offered to share it with them, you know, in exchange for a let's take our missiles
*  down to zero. And, you know, I got mad at him in Iceland when I think he, I thought he was acting
*  like an old codger because they came up and said, we're offering you this, you know, half the missiles
*  or this or that. And he said, no, he would, because they wanted us to get rid of Star Wars,
*  which didn't exist. And he said, well, you know, you have to get rid of Star Wars.
*  And if we'd done that, the Soviets would have just gone on their merry way and been doing what they
*  would have had been doing. But Reagan said no. And the Soviet Union came toppling down, but it was,
*  it was great progress that he made. And it took a cold warrior, hard assed cold warrior
*  to be able to negotiate with them. And that's what we don't have today.
*  Right. Yeah. Did you, how much research did you have to do on Reagan before you did this film?
*  Did you, did you do a deep dive?
*  Yeah. Well, for one thing, I lived through it. I remember every single thing, because even back
*  then I was, I was a big news walk, even though I had three channels, three news channels. And,
*  and also when I was offered the part, I, he was my favorite president. Okay. And
*  I didn't say yes, I didn't say no. He's like Muhammad Ali. He's known, you know, all over the
*  world. People know what he looks like, sounds like and the like. And I didn't want to do an impression
*  impersonation like Saturday Night Live, because when I play a real person, I want to play it from
*  their point of view. And sometimes that means that means warts and all, you know, what are,
*  not just like what you did, but what are your insecurities? What are your, what do you really
*  care about? How do you, how'd you feel when you got jilted, you know, or whatever that make us up
*  who we are in the end? And it took me a long time to say yes, but I went to, I got invited to the
*  Reagan ranch, which was the Western White House back then. And when he, when Reagan died, some
*  friends bought it and left it exactly as it is. He and Nancy's clothes are in the closet.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah. He expected them to come back. They didn't change a thing. And the only guy that was up there
*  was John Bartlett, who was Reagan's Secret Service guy he rode with, rode horses with every day.
*  So it would go up five miles of the worst road in California and get to the top of the mountain,
*  come through the gate and I could feel him. I could just feel him in every square inch of that place,
*  you know, and I could feel he was a humble guy. His library with every book, is that a big book
*  case? With every book going back to like nine years old, the printer of Udell is there and
*  they had a king-size bed, but it was two single beds zip-tied together.
*  Huh. The house is 1,100 square feet, you know, maybe two rooms of this and very simple. And
*  you know, this is the Western White House. All the appliances are GE, because he was a spokesman for
*  GE back then and he bought that place after he was governor. But either he didn't have much money or
*  it was really cheap. But-
*  Or he wanted to live simple.
*  Yeah. He knew how to live simply. It was this person and I felt him. And then, you know, in the
*  research, he was an actor and he had a sunny- we both have sunny dispositions too, I think,
*  naturally. But I don't think- one of the things about Reagan is I don't think he ever got to where
*  he wanted to get as an actor, I think was one of the disappointments for him. And, you know, his
*  career was going towards at the end when he married Jane Wyman, who, you know, who won an
*  Academy Award the next year. And I think his self-esteem was actually pretty low at that point,
*  because he was looking for a purpose in his life that he never found until he got the- he ran for
*  and was elected vice president of the Screen Actors Guild and then president of the Screen
*  Actors Guild. And that's not a job that anybody who's an actor, you aspire to be, right?
*  Right.
*  But it's like when God shuts a door, he opens a window somewhere and this was his entry into
*  politics. And, you know, that's where that road started. And at the time that he was- that he was
*  president, the Soviet Union- they found the files after they fell, by the way, in the Soviet Union.
*  They were trying to infiltrate the media, of course, into movies and through the unions
*  to- for control of that. And that was his, in earnest, I mean, there were fistfights in
*  Union Halls over it that he was involved in. And he did a lot of great- the reason we actors have
*  great health insurance is because of Ronald Reagan, by the way.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  No kidding.
*  He was- in fact, that happened in, I think it was 60 or 61, and he wasn't even president
*  of the Screen Actors Guild then. He had been, I think, like six years later, his term had run out,
*  but he came back and got that ran through because that was the right thing to do.
*  That was when he was a Democrat.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. He got us- I mean, we have the best health insurance of any union I can think of,
*  and that was because of Ronald Reagan.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  The whole film industry is in deep trouble with AI. That's going to be a real problem.
*  Mm-hmm.
*  That's going to decimate jobs.
*  Or it could be a future source of revenue for my kids and grandkids, and after that,
*  well, they want Dennis Quaid to do a movie they could just create.
*  Oh, that's true. That is true. Well, didn't Bruce Willis sign off on something like that?
*  I think he signed off on allowing them to use it because Bruce obviously has a horrible condition,
*  aphasia, and he can't act anymore. I think he signed off on digital rights for something,
*  some limited aspect of that.
*  Mm-hmm. I was- Cash was- what is the name of that? The boy band thing that's a dirty-
*  it's a documentary about the guy, Peterson, I think, that started the boy bands.
*  They had a- in sync and they had a documentary on him.
*  No, Bruce Willis didn't sell his likeness to a deep fake company.
*  That's a deep fake.
*  Initial reports. So what did he do?
*  They did something like that, but the company didn't own his likeness or anything.
*  He did a commercial or something where they used his likeness.
*  So he only signed off on this one thing?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, so they're saying that he signed off.
*  Sure. Interesting.
*  Well, anyway, this documentary, they take this guy and they take old footage of him
*  and they put other words in his mouth, talking to the camera.
*  And you believe it. I mean, it's seamless.
*  So yeah, it is scary in that way. It's also good me use for great things as well.
*  We can- for computing ability, that would take years and years to take a couple of minutes.
*  Or if you're making a movie and you want to- you can go out in an empty stadium and just create
*  a crowd that doesn't look like cutout pictures.
*  Which was- I think, of course, it takes away extra ability to earn a living,
*  but it also means that you can make like a $4 billion movie instead of a $40 billion movie,
*  and get smaller movies and more people have access to making movies.
*  That's true.
*  That's one way of looking at it.
*  So it's-
*  Also, it might eliminate actors. That's possible too.
*  Well, that wouldn't be such a bad idea.
*  As long as I can play golf and somebody else comes to the set digitally, okay.
*  Do you think that expressing your conservative viewpoints and doing this film on Reagan,
*  do you think this ultimately has the potential to hurt your career?
*  I don't care anymore. There was a time that I was kind of concerned to kind of speak my mind
*  up, but in this, really in the last couple of years that I feel it's really important
*  that we do, all of us, speak up. In this election, everybody's got to choose a side,
*  and we have to, in order to have this exchange of ideas and dialogue, we have to speak up.
*  And so, like I said, what I was doing Reagan, there was a story that came out that I was taking
*  money from the CDC, $400,000, the Trump administration had arranged so I could do a
*  commercial for the vaccine that was coming out, but none of which was true. But it was like
*  my son even called me like freaking out, because it was like I was going to get canceled over this
*  stuff because I was taking, I guess, taxpayer money from the CDC, making money off this.
*  None of it was true.
*  Where did it come from? Did they find a source?
*  I really have no idea. It's something that's circulated in social media. So, I really don't
*  know. But that, and I remember when Trump, when COVID first started, I think it was Politico that
*  I did a phone conversation with, because I was involved with this podcast company that we were
*  promoting. And it just happened to be COVID. And the guy asked me what I thought about the way
*  Trump was handling the COVID. And I said, well, at least he's there every day. He's there every day
*  trying to do something. And I think when it comes to things like this, we need to get behind our
*  president as a whole to come together to fight this thing, just like Franklin Roosevelt getting
*  behind during World War, at the start of World War II in order to, well, anyway, that became that I
*  was a right-wing Trumpster and that supposedly in danger of getting canceled over that. And then I
*  also gave a speech about Reagan to the group in Florida after we'd made the movie. And I think
*  there were two people that were January 6th. People just happened to be there. And by association,
*  you know, that was going to be, my agents called me like freaking out over that. Like it was going
*  to be canceled. It's like being told to just be quiet and let things go by, you know? And
*  no, I just can't. I'm not a very good rule follower to begin with, you know? It's just
*  one of those faults I've had. But- Good for you.
*  Yeah. But- I think that kind of makes you a good actor too.
*  Well, I just- It's a rebellious nature.
*  Well, maybe that's debatable, but there's a lot of rebellious people I know who are really bad actors.
*  Touché, yeah. There's a lot of that.
*  I don't know. I think we all have kind of an obligation, you want to call it, or a duty,
*  or whatever. We're citizens of America. We're citizens of the United States. We, the country
*  is ours. It's the people of the United States who are supposed to run things. And so we have to
*  speak out. I hated when actors spoke out about politics. I remember the days like Richard Dreyfus
*  or whoever would talk shows. It always just sounded like so stupid because, of course,
*  they didn't know anything. So what little I know, I do have to speak out about, and I'm sorry,
*  Richard, I first said that about you. He's very vocal now.
*  He always has been. But if they have the right to go on TV and talk about how,
*  I've seen several actors go on there and talk about how Biden is like, I saw him, he was in great
*  shape. But I have the right to go on and talk about that I'm voting for Trump because people
*  might call him an asshole, but he's my asshole. Yeah. Well, we don't have the best choices today.
*  It's interesting that we put so much weight on famous people. We put so much weight on their
*  opinion and perspectives on things. We want a guy like George Clooney to be out there endorsing
*  Kamala Harris and talking about the threat to democracy that is Donald Trump and all that.
*  Right. Because he does it so well in the movies. You notice Tom Hanks has been very silent.
*  Yeah. I don't blame him.
*  I also think that presidents are a reflection of who we are as a people and what our culture has
*  become. You can go back like Reagan reflected his times. He probably couldn't get elected today
*  because it came off like camp. They're just kind of solid. But along comes Trump swears. It's okay
*  to say shit, fuck, piss, whatever you want on TV before that with cable news. Now you can say it,
*  but it took somebody like Trump to actually say it. Yeah. He was really the first one that opened
*  up that door. Remember that speech that he gave about how you deal with China? You don't say we're
*  going to tax you 20% and you say, listen motherfuckers. Yeah. And everybody's like, whoa.
*  Oh, yeah. I loved it. I was like, all right. Plain speaking, just like you said it before.
*  Like an actual human being. Because that's how actual human beings talk about something.
*  The emotions it brings up in you. I guess Obama was the first one to really truly use social media
*  in a way because he understood it. And so did Trump. I mean, he was tweeting.
*  It's probably why the polls didn't really reflect what was going on because people
*  are just reading his tweets. Well, the tweets are so ridiculous. He can't help himself. He's got to
*  insult people and go after people. And that's how he made his career. I mean, that was him
*  in the public eye. Yeah. Starting with Rosie O'Donnell. Yeah. I remember in that feud that
*  got him. That was so ridiculous back then. Leave that poor lady alone. I do cringe sometimes and
*  stuff, but I know where he is at the bottom of it, that he really does care about the American
*  people and he really loves this country. And he's really smart, really smart. And he knows how to
*  deal with foreign policy-wise, which is a huge thing with me because it has an effect on everything
*  else in our culture, our economy, just the way we feel inside. And I think he's so much, he's best
*  for that. I'd like to say focus more on the issues. Yes. And be very disciplined
*  about doing that because when he goes off that, they love that. Yeah. Any chance they can make it
*  personal, they love that. I also think that he gets sucked into some things that I think are traps.
*  I think one of the traps that's been set recently is the use of computer-generated imagery with
*  Kamala Harris's campaign. I think he got sucked into a trap because he made a post about how the
*  crowds that were at the airport to meet her were fake, that it was CGI. And a lot of people thought
*  they were CGI. And there was a lot of people tweeting about it, that it was CGI. And I was
*  looking at it, I was like, this is interesting because it's so obvious. Why would they do that?
*  Well, one of the ways they would do that is to put out fake images or put out the idea that there
*  were fake images so that he makes this post. He would bite on it. He bites on it. And then they go,
*  actually, there's video of it. And then they can go back and really see when the crowds were there.
*  And prove that it was... Exactly. Because they're so used to Biden doing a rally and you never see
*  the size of the crowd and you can feel that there's nobody there. And there's tepid applause.
*  Also, you can hire people to go to those things. It's not difficult to hire a crowd. You can get a
*  crowd to go to a comedy show if you wanted to. You can get a crowd to do almost anything. Also,
*  they did this very wise thing, the Harris campaign, where they would have famous singers.
*  They would have famous singers and entertainers perform there and then she would be there as well.
*  So people would essentially get a free concert. So they were basically at a concert.
*  Exactly. Not hard to get. Not hard to do. Especially if you have a big urban environment.
*  You want to get 10,000 people to go to a place. Not that hard. And granted, you know what? It did
*  energize the Democrats when Joe stepped down. Oh, yeah. Because there was... They knew they were
*  fucked if he stayed in there. Yeah, they knew it. Every time we talked, it was getting worse. It was
*  a ray of hope. And somebody young. And so all the people that... They got volunteers and they...
*  They're going all in. Supposedly, unless they really abscond the Republican agenda,
*  which it seems like she's trying to do. Clinton did that actually in 94. He was going to be a
*  lame duck president. He was going down. And his response was in the State of Union's address,
*  he said, the age of welfare is over. And he basically took over the Republican agenda.
*  And we had like six years of just incredible... The economy was amazing. It was a force. And
*  she started with Kamala now is taking over the whole no tax on tips. Try to take that over.
*  Trying to say that she's never was the border czar and that from day one, she's going to do
*  something about it. I think there's like, what? Four or five months left in the administration
*  right now. Yeah. Why don't you do something about it now? Also the denying she was the border czar
*  when there's hundreds of people talking on television calling her the border czar. Oh,
*  yeah. It's nuts. Yeah. That's the craziest gaslight. Including Joe Biden himself said border czar. Yeah.
*  They said it on CNN and then CNN later saying she was never the border czar. Yeah. Oh, she wasn't.
*  Yeah. Well, why'd you say it back then? You guys are misinformation. Yeah. So,
*  she didn't go to the border. She went to the border of Nicaragua and then in the
*  bordering country or whatever, talking about the root cause and all that stuff. Well, yeah,
*  root cause. It's... Well, it seems very coordinated, doesn't it? The border thing.
*  Yeah. That one I really want to know, like, what are they trying to do? What's the end goal here?
*  I mean, it seemed the obvious thing would be for the old idea that that's for voters, that people
*  coming into this country are naturally Democrats, but that's not really true. You know, I have so
*  many Latino friends and the people that came here the right way, they can't stand what's going on
*  because they really can't. And they have a tendency to really kind of get families and
*  churches and stuff to become conservative and believe in the American dream. And
*  so that's not true. I mean, the only other thing would be the power, I guess, and you create...
*  You have definitely less Republican votes, I guess they think, with that. And you create chaos,
*  and you... Which is kind of another kind of Soviet tactic that, you know, if you want to
*  foment revolution, that's what you do, create chaos. So, you know, that's... We're really
*  getting into a conspiracy theory for that, but I just, I don't see the sense of it. And then I
*  have people like my housekeeper, Josie, who was over here illegally for so long in her life, but
*  then, finally, I said, when Trump was going to get elected in 2016, she was like really,
*  really afraid. And I said, you know what, we have to do this the right way. I'm
*  going to apply for citizenship and I'm going to sponsor you. And so we started the process then,
*  you know, got her green card and everything to do it. And she went through her citizenship test
*  with me, which she was doing. She's failed twice, but I went through the citizenship test with her.
*  She got everything perfect, but she goes over there and she gets treated like dirt, you know.
*  Right. Really. Which is crazy that people trying to do it the right way get treated like shit.
*  And she gets treated like she's doing something wrong or whatever. And I know she can pass it
*  because I went through the whole thing with her randomly. And yet if you come into this country
*  illegally, they're going to pay for your hotel. They're going to give you a thousand dollars to
*  spend. They're going to... That's so insane. What state do you want to go to? And, you know,
*  we don't get those rights. Well, it's just insane when we have so many poor people in this country
*  that are US citizens that aren't being taken care of. And you're just letting people come here.
*  Veterans. Yeah, veterans. Letting people come here illegally and giving them all this money.
*  Like, what's the end game? Yeah. What is the end game? And also, Kamala Harris... Because even the
*  mayor of New York is complaining about it. Yeah. Well, he fucked up. He called it a sanctuary city.
*  We welcome anybody. And they're like, great. Come on down. Well, also Kamala Harris has said that
*  terrorists aren't coming in through the border. That's not true. They've arrested terrorists.
*  That's been going on for a very long time. I mean, even back to the Bush administration,
*  where they would send floods of like kids. The cartel would come down to, you know, people way
*  down in Mexico said, we're taking your kids. And that's it. Couldn't say a single thing about it.
*  The cartel runs Mexico, I believe. You know, that's a fact. And just bringing them to the border and
*  a flood of sending in a flood of kids or whoever across the border in embedded in that are terrorists.
*  You send, you know, send in a thousand with four terrorists and the odds are a lot better of getting
*  in here. Yeah. And that's been going on for a very long time. And... But it's just never been as porous
*  as it is now, right? Because now it's not just porous. It's like an open invitation. Yeah. Which
*  is just insane. And then if you want to come here from Europe, like say if you're a mathematician or
*  something like that, or even a friend of mine from Estonia, he's a comedian. He's trying very hard
*  to get his green card. It's very, it's a difficult process. Yeah. If you want to come here illegally,
*  all you have to do is walk. Right. They'll let you in, they give you a cell phone, they give you money.
*  They'll put you up at a hotel, they give you free food. It's crazy. They throw away their
*  IDs and everything. Yep. You know, before they come across the border, you can say you're anybody.
*  From any country. Yeah. No genetics testing. No questions asked. Just, oh hey, come to a future
*  court date maybe. Yeah. Seven years. What state would you like to go to? Right. And then the
*  court dates are years ahead. So you get to live in this country illegally subsidized for years.
*  And you would assume that those people are going to vote for the people that did that for them.
*  And I think that's part of the issue. And you know, a lot of... There's deals made with the
*  cartel. The cartel is like, the cartel is charging, it was $5,000 a head.
*  To get people across? $5,000 a head times 15 million. What does that come to? That's a lot of money.
*  Jesus Christ. You know, that I think basically our government has been paying for a lot,
*  you know, subsidizing them over there and dealing with the cartel. And it's,
*  the world has turned upside down. It really is from, at least from the world, I want to. But,
*  you know, I'm old and so, maybe not so relevant. But I don't think that common sense, I think it's
*  always relevant, if you ask me. It's relevant. It's very relevant. Everything's relevant. It's
*  also like everybody recognizes that this is not the best course for everybody, for the whole
*  country. Regardless of if you're a left-wing person, you do not want terrorists sneaking into this
*  country and blowing up cities. You don't. Of course you don't. So if there's an option where
*  they can get here easily and quickly, you would want to seal that up for everybody. Even if you're
*  a kind person that thinks we should make some sort of a path to citizenship, which I agree,
*  like your housekeeper. I agree. Yeah, absolutely. There should be some sort of a path where people
*  who are here, look, I'm the grandchild of immigrants. People came across because they
*  wanted a better life, but it was easier to do back then, the 20s. Yeah. Not hard. Get over here.
*  Once you're here, you can settle down. Yeah. I mean, there should be a path. And that's one of
*  the things that made America so interesting, because it's a melting pot of all these ambitious
*  people that came here from a place that sucked and they carved out a life. Yeah. Yeah. There
*  should be a path. I'm all for immigrants. It should be a legal path. Yeah. Yeah. From everywhere.
*  Just to do it the right way. Right. It's better for everybody. Yes. Better for everybody. You know,
*  that's just the way it is. I mean, as it is now, it's just at Venezuelan gangs are,
*  you know, all are all moving into the same neighborhood. It's very much like the fine
*  points, you know, back in New York days. What? The Aurora Colorado apartment building. Do you
*  know that issue? No. Okay. There's an apartment building in Aurora, Colorado that has been taken
*  over by Venezuelan gangs. Yeah. And so they essentially, no one can collect rent anymore.
*  The gangs collecting rent. They're evicting everyone out of the building and they're controlling this
*  building and everyone's aware of it. Yeah. And it's been- Basically squatting or the laws,
*  using the laws of the United- Exactly. Yeah. Because Colorado is incredibly liberal. Right.
*  That area is incredibly liberal. Yeah. So see if you can find that story on the Venezuelan gangs
*  taking over the apartment building in Colorado. There was, I was watching a news piece on it today
*  where they were, you know, expressing this real confusion and frustration that there was nothing
*  that they could be doing about this and that they have different doors have Xs on them.
*  The red Xs are when people have been evacuated from the apartment. They shut it down. They shut
*  down Slumlord Apartments. Wait a minute. Slumlord. Are they saying anything about the gangs? That's
*  what I Googled it. Are they calling them Slumlords now? Aurora evictions draw attention to owners
*  neglect at other apartments. Yeah, maybe that's true. But what about the gangs? That's what I
*  Googled and this is what pops up. Yeah. See, that's the problem with Google. There's some stories.
*  Okay. Special task force. Check that out. Okay, here we go. Special task force investigating
*  Venezuelan gangs alleged ties to Aurora. Aurora City Council officials say that apartment complex
*  on Gnome Street is closing to decode violations, but some council members alleged there's more
*  to the story. So this is what I've been reading. What I've been reading is that these Venezuelan
*  gangs have occupied this thing. The gang known as Trendy Aragua started out as a prison gang
*  in Venezuela, has expanded throughout the Western Hemisphere. Last month, the Biden administration
*  designated the gang as a transnational criminal organization, accusing it of engaging in human
*  smuggling and trafficking, gender-based violence, money laundering, and illicit drug trafficking.
*  Aurora Police Department, in partnership with the Raven Task Force, has assigned four detectives
*  to a special task force that includes additional local, state, and federal partners to investigate
*  the violent crime impacting our migrant community, said Aurora PD spokesperson late Thursday.
*  Yeah. Well, they take it over to the apartment complex. The city is closing near Cold Facts and
*  Peoria. Interesting. So they just basically take over an apartment complex and there's
*  ain't nothing you can do about it type of situation. Yeah. You can go through the courts all you want.
*  Well, especially if our laws are so lax. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's not good. And if they're all
*  flooding in through the border and these are the type of people that are flooding and those guys
*  aren't coming over legally, the Venezuelan gang members. So that is an effect of what this-
*  Basically, especially Venezuela. I mean, that's been going on for a while. People trying to
*  leave the country and then they empty the jails, like Castro did. Empty the jails and let them
*  come out. Because the gangs are their political force. At some point, they become a political
*  force. Yeah. Because how many that takes, but that's what they're doing. Especially when you
*  have- You have things like defunding the police and this lack of appreciation for law enforcement.
*  Yeah. No cash bail. It's just a slap on the wrist. All of it is crazy. You can beat up cops and it's
*  okay. You can beat up cops as an illegal immigrant on film and you just get let out of jail and the
*  kids give them the Tupac double fingers to the- Yeah. Oh man. Crazy. What is the end game of
*  this type of behavior and how is there no course correction? That's what's scary to people and what
*  should be scary to people. Because this seems like if I wanted to throw the country into complete
*  chaos, that's how I would do it. Of course. I'd have gangs come in through the border. That's the
*  way Stalin did it. They were involved in bank- Stalin in his earlier his career, they robbed banks.
*  Wow. That's what they did. They were a gang and basically mayhem, but they robbed banks to finance
*  the cause. Crazy. What a weird time. Yeah. Well, listen Dennis, I appreciate you very much. I've
*  always loved your movies. Same on you, man. I really enjoyed talking to you. Yeah, really. It's a
*  lot of fun. Couple of conspiracy theorists just getting together talking it over. Couple of loons.
*  Getting that adrenaline rush. When does Reagan come out? Reagan comes out August the 30th. All
*  right. I'll be watching. Quite a few theaters actually. There it is. And I'm very proud of it.
*  I love the movie and number one, I hope people are entertained. And also if you were born before
*  1985, you can go to remember how great this country used to be. And if you're after 1985,
*  you can see it and you can realize how great this country still could be.
*  All right. Thank you very much, brother. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye everybody.
*  you
