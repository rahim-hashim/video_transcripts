# Joe Rogan Experience #1385 - Paul Stamets
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 15, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ6Ym719urg)
*  3, 2, 1, and we're live. Hello, Paul.
*  Hey there.
*  What's happening? How are you, sir?
*  Very well. How are you?
*  And you have newfangled mushroom hats. These are surprisingly durable. So think about these
*  mushroom hats. You would think, oh, it's going to fall apart in your fingers, but no, it's quite
*  pliable.
*  It's quite pliable and it's known as German felt. And this allowed the iceman, Otzi, to be able to
*  travel into the Alps. It was a fire starter mushroom.
*  Really?
*  And this actually revolutionized warfare because it helped Flint spark guns, ignite the gun powder.
*  Really?
*  So it's Amadou. And it comes from a birch polypore mushroom, which is a subject of much of our
*  research these days.
*  Now, when this grows in the wild, what does it look like? Because this is, you've fashioned it
*  into this hat or had someone fashion it. That's what it looks like?
*  Yeah, some ladies in Transylvania.
*  I see that.
*  Yeah. It's called Fomis fomentarius. It allowed for the portability of fire. There's no doubt we
*  all came from Africa. We went north and we discovered winter. This allowed for fire to be
*  carried for days. And so your clan was absolutely dependent upon fire starting in order to survive
*  the winter. And this mushroom allowed and enabled people to survive.
*  Wow. It's very light. Is it edible?
*  Excellent question. Hippocrates first described it in 400 BCE as an anti-inflammatory. So in teas,
*  yes, but that's very, very tough. When you put it in ash and water, it delaminates into mycelium.
*  And so some ladies in Transylvania still make these. And as a fabric that you pull, that mushroom
*  there will become one hat or maybe more because it just keeps on elongating. And it's made of
*  mycelium. So explain the process. How would you take this slab of mushroom that I have that looks
*  like sort of like an enormous Hershey's kiss? And then you would put that in water with ash
*  from a fire. Why ash? What is that? Because it's highly alkaline. And then it helps it separate.
*  It begins to delaminate. And literally you start pulling us. And it's a fabric that you keep on
*  felting. And so it was called German felt. And it's been used for literally thousands of years.
*  And beekeepers actually use this for smoking hives. We could, but it would be kind of bizarre.
*  We could flick a beak and you'd burn up one of these things. It's just amazing how much
*  this is a fuse. And one spark on this can ignite this entire thing over 15, 20 minutes.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And so beekeepers use it for smoking hives.
*  So if I lit this right now with this lighter?
*  Not that. If you lit this.
*  No, that. The powder. So this, the ash, the powdered ash, and then the water,
*  and then how does it flatten out and become what the-
*  Because it soaks up and mycelium makes mushrooms, mushrooms make mycelium. And so
*  when you soak this and then it gets soggy and then it tenderizes and then you start
*  breaking it and pulling it apart. This was actually probably the first discovery because
*  our ancestors noticed when insects were born to this mushroom.
*  Is that like the unprocessed version of it? So this is what it's like on one side?
*  Well, it's just made into a little table thing, but it's the same thing basically.
*  So is this stitched together? How do they make it like this?
*  Actually, it says using a wood glue, but that's all the natural colors. Nothing's been added to it.
*  And so they just pull it apart.
*  Pull it apart and make it into a fabric.
*  Yeah. I really want to make a coat. That's my goal is to have somebody make a coat for me.
*  Would it tear easily?
*  It's an amazingly strong tinsel fabric. It absorbs water, but you have to be careful.
*  Someone smoking a joint or near a fire or smoking a cigarette. It happened to me. I got a big hole
*  in one of mine and I was smelling the smoke and my head was on fire. More than once.
*  How many folks are out there wearing mushroom hats these days?
*  Just a few hundred. And we've been trying to actually keep the industry alive by just
*  inundating the... There was like 25 or 30 of these hat makers in Transylvania 10, 15 years ago.
*  Then it shrunk down to four or five. And a friend of mine, David Summerlin, visited and said,
*  Paul, this hat making technology is on the verge of extinction. And so we just sort of inundated
*  them with orders in order to build the industry and keep it alive.
*  How could someone contribute to that if they wanted to? If people are listening to this,
*  how could they buy one of these hats?
*  Well, if you go to my Facebook.com slash Paul Stamets, I think his name is Mako, actually
*  squatted on my page to sell the hats and more power to them.
*  Interesting.
*  But this mushroom is figuring to be very prominently important for saving bees. And that's
*  where our research has been astonishingly interesting lately.
*  And where is that thing that you brought in? What is that?
*  So to get some context to this, I think shamanistically, mushrooms, plants, animals
*  become important because of plurality, a multiplicity of benefits. This is one example,
*  not only revolutionized warfare, not only allowed for the portability of fire for us to save
*  ourselves from the coldness. And we migrated into Europe from Africa. Not only did beekeepers use
*  it for smoking, but fly fishermen use it also for drying flies. But we have found that this
*  mushroom is extremely powerful for reducing viruses that harm bees. And we are, it's been
*  described today in CNN, a bee insect apocalypse, 40% of insects are under threat. This just came
*  out. And this is really an all hands on deck moment. But I'm optimistic because I think we
*  can find solutions in nature. So with my colleagues, and when I was here before, I talked about work
*  with the BioShield BioDefense Program, and these wood conks are very strong in antiviral properties
*  against flu viruses and herpes, etc. I use these ideas, and actually had a waking dream.
*  And I realized that the bees were being infected by mites with viruses, and the deformed wing virus
*  in particular is the worst virus. And so I contacted Washington State University, we started
*  doing some research, and I'm really, really happy because I love skeptics who become my supporters.
*  We published in Nature. Only 7% of the articles submitted in Nature get published in the Nature
*  publication ecosystem. To this day, our articles are in the top 1% of all articles ever published
*  in the Nature publication ecosystem. Now that's phenomenal because that's the most credible
*  scientific journal in the world. Here it is right there. Extracts of polypore mushroom, mycelia,
*  reduce viruses in honey bees. And this mushroom, the amadou, reduces the deformed wing virus 800
*  times to one with one treatment, and then the reishi mushroom mycelium reduces the
*  lake cyanide virus more than 45,000 to one. Now these are wood conks that grow in trees,
*  and we all grew up with Winnie the Pooh, but no one made the connection before me apparently,
*  that bees are attracted to rotted wood because of immunological benefit. So amadou and reishi
*  mushrooms we found and we published in this article that high significance, and I think the
*  reason why this article is in the top 1% of all Nature articles is that I've been able to present
*  the theory with proof now that a natural product can have a broader bioshield of benefits than a
*  pure pharmaceutical. Up to this time, there's been no agents to reduce viruses in bees. Now the deformed
*  wing virus is being vectored by the varroa mite, came in 1984, and it injects viruses into bees,
*  and so it's like a dirty syringe, and these viruses debilitate the bees and shorten their
*  ability to fly. Look at that poor bumblebee. Oh wow, that's crazy. I mean that is so sad because
*  that bumblebee can't fly. Now bees can pollinate up to a thousand flowers a day, and the average
*  flight time of like honey bees was used to be nine days, a thousand flowers a day. Every almond
*  you eat was visited by a bee, so one bee can pollinate a thousand flowers a day. Nine days was
*  our pollination flight time, now it's been reshortened to four days, so we lost by 50%.
*  In the CNN article that we just showed in China now, they're hand pollinating flowers.
*  Yeah, with paint brushes.
*  A paint of apples. So apples, cherries, almonds, strawberries, tomatoes.
*  Because of the lack of bees.
*  Because of the absence of bees. So it's really, it's all hands on deck. I'm really optimistic
*  about the future because we have solutions in nature that we can now amplify and be able to
*  deploy. So one of my inventions, and I'm giving these away, 10,000 of these for free, I've come
*  up with a citizen scientist bee feeder that puts these extracts into sugar water, and we have a
*  sign up sheet, it's for free, it says fungi.com slash bees, and we're going to give away the
*  first 10,000 of these, and this basically allows citizen scientists to help wild bees,
*  because wild bees are given about 80% of the benefits. And if you scroll down, there's a
*  really, we just got the CGI done. If you go all the way down and then click on that video,
*  and we just, so here's the bee feeder.
*  This is available on YouTube, folks. It says bee mushroomed feeder,
*  bee mushroomed all one word, and then feeder.
*  Yeah, and now watch, that's the bees visiting, and they're taking the sugar water.
*  Look how much they're sucking out of it, those little greedy bastards.
*  That's crazy how it goes away so quickly.
*  And this is a maze, and bees are better at navigating mazes, and so you can see the bees
*  going in and out. My grandson was afraid of bees, was really fascinated by this, so I got him to do
*  this. And so these are something that we're going to make these available all over, and then I'm
*  going to create vertical gardens in apartment buildings, so the bees fly up 200 feet. You
*  create ladders then, ecological ladders, and then this is the way the citizen scientists all over
*  the world can take action to be able to help bees from collapsing, and then you station these
*  in neighborhoods for bumblebees, for other types of bees, and then we have it with a wi-fi enabled
*  device with solar panels, and then we upload into the cloud all this data about bee pollination
*  visits. So we can create a metric on the baseline of bee pollination services. So if you see bees
*  that are declining and suddenly below a baseline, in Oklahoma two years ago, 84% of the beehives
*  died. Now think if you're a cattle rancher and you lost 84% of your cattle. So the idea is to
*  help bees' immune system, and if we create baselines with these bee feeders, upload the data,
*  and this becomes a new form of internet because they have wi-fi ability, so it's a distributed
*  network as well. Where is the wi-fi on that? Well we don't have this in development right now. We're
*  working with a very very large computer company who's making all the instrumentation and they're
*  into big data. So we have a solar panel going in here, we have blue LED lights, because bees are
*  attracted to blue light, and they'll count the number of bees going in and out, and since bees
*  are only flying that daytime, we don't need a battery. And so the solar power will then upload
*  the data into the cloud, and then we'll create mega data sets. And then we can look in Africa,
*  Indonesia. How is it going to upload into the cloud? What is it using? It's using an LTE.
*  Oh so it's using like a cellular system. A cellular system or low frequency long range
*  communication systems. Can we help? Can we contribute? Is there a way that this podcast
*  can help? A lot. I want to enable people with solutions that they can teach their children
*  the importance of natural systems and they can take action. This seems like a great one. I mean
*  I love this idea. I think it's awesome. I can afford to give away 10,000. I talked to this
*  computer company that everybody knows, but they asked me not to use their name, and they asked
*  how many do we need? I said about 10 billion. The billion. Billion. And because this, but
*  I will do up to my capacity, and then I'm hoping that you know we're going to give these away for
*  free and then eventually we'll create networks of hubs where I have now 40 patents on this
*  and helping bees survive from these extracts, but not in Indonesia, not in India, not in Africa,
*  not in China, not in Japan. I've open sourced it for most of the world. I'm basically commercial,
*  I'm going to commercialize it so the haves can help the have nots. And I think a lot of people
*  want to help and if you, and we're thinking about different ways of doing this, I'm open to all
*  ideas, but the idea is to get maybe one person to sponsor 10 other people. They have a distributed
*  network, their own social media community where they end up with getting schools. We will open
*  source the code for 3D printers. So that's really important for schools. So the code's going to be
*  open sourced. But then if somebody wanted to make millions of these and sell them, of course, you
*  know, I wouldn't be happy with that. They have to work with me. But individually, we can empower
*  individuals in schools to have the open source 3D printing codes.
*  Pete Slauson We just have to make it trendy to have one of these in your house. Like, look,
*  I'm helping. I'm helping the bees. If we just did that, it would really make a big difference.
*  I know that's a gross way to look at it, but that works.
*  Pete Slauson My grandson Kai is a perfect example. He was
*  shuddering in fear coming near to this. And my friend, Dr. Steve Shepard, entomologist,
*  taught me something about bees I didn't know. Bees are moving so fast. And we look like we're
*  moving slow. But if you move really slow, the bees think you're a statue. And so, the idea,
*  and so, my grandson and Kai said, look at this and you can see underneath, you can see the bees
*  going in and out. I said, they move really slow. And then he got fascinated watching the bees.
*  So, he overcame his fear of bees. He was excited that he's helping bees survive.
*  Now, we've created something intergenerationally. And saving the bees is the number one bridge
*  concept between conservatives and liberals. Everyone wants to save the bees.
*  Pete Slauson That's number one?
*  Dr. Steve Shepard It's the number one bridge issue
*  between mending the fence, so to speak, crossing the political and social divide.
*  Everybody wants to save the bees. So, this is something, this is an actionable solution.
*  And the, you know, the scientific data out there is pretty disturbing, you know,
*  75% of flying insects in the past 27 years and report from Germany that just came out
*  have disappeared. Now, many of your listeners are out in the country, you know, I grew up in the
*  country. Remember all the bug splatter you used to have against your windshield? You don't see that
*  anymore because the insects are dying because of exposure to pesticides, monoculture. When you
*  have monoculture, you have what's called pollination deserts. When you have lots of biodiversity,
*  lots of plants and diversity, the plants are pollinating at different times of the season.
*  When you do to a monoculture, all the plants like almonds, they'll all produce flowers all at once.
*  And then there's no pollen available. So, the immune system of the bees,
*  due to factory farming, loss of habitat, deforestation, glyphosate, you know, heavy
*  metals, pollution, all those things are cofactors. But the nail in the coffin is by far these viruses.
*  And so, immunologically empowering and supporting the immune system of bees,
*  then it gives the bees the opportunity or the ability to be able to survive longer,
*  do more pollination. Is there a specific source of these viruses that they can isolate?
*  Are these a new thing? Well, actually, there's a slide that shows the pandemic spread of these
*  viruses throughout the world that came from Asia. And it's now a global pandemic. All bees in the
*  world are now infected with these viruses because when they infected honeybee, for instance,
*  visits the flower, it leaves viral particles in the flower and the flower and then a wild bumblebee
*  comes and visits it and it becomes infected. So, there is a unfortunate, I don't want to use the
*  word perfect storm, it's a terrible storm of cofactors. And because, you know, 80% of the
*  benefit the farmers receive is from wild bees. We can't count them. And, you know, I have
*  beehives and what happened to colony collapse, you go out on Monday, the bees are happy,
*  you go down Thursday, they're all gone. I mean, it's that quick. And it's not like there's hundreds
*  of dead bees around your beehive, they're just gone. And there can be hundreds of pounds of honey
*  and the bees, you know, they're gone. So, they go off somewhere to the die? What happens is because
*  the newly hatched bees are called nurse bees and the nurse bees take care of the baby bees.
*  But when the colony senses there's not enough pollen and food to support the brood in the colony,
*  the nurse bees are prematurely recruited to go out and find pollen. So, they abandon the babies
*  and then the varroa mites are, they just go uncontrolled and they start injecting viruses.
*  And so, there are other co-factors just like when you get an infection from a
*  viral infection, you can get bacterial infections. And so, there's a cascade of
*  opportunistic infections as immunologies decreased because of these viruses.
*  So, isn't there a contributing factor that had to do with cell phones as well?
*  I actually, I'm really glad you brought that up. This is a contributing factor. I have not seen
*  convincing evidence as a hypothesis that's not fully fleshed out. There are some people
*  quite adamant in their belief in this, but I'm driven by science and data. I can, the rhythms,
*  the frequency of the high of cell phones is an argument that's made. It's not in the same cosine
*  wave of the wavelengths that we experience in nature. And so, this is disruptive. I understand
*  that I'm still on the fence. I'd like to see really strong data and scientific evidence of that,
*  but it's a hypothesis that needs to be tested. That's why we're looking also at
*  low frequency, long range communication systems. I think I told you this story. If I didn't,
*  I apologize. When we were on fear factor, we had a bee stunt. We had to cover these people in bees
*  and a local bee colony flew in to check out what was going on. And those bees and the bees that
*  were brought there met in the sky and worked it out. And the beekeeper told us, okay, we have to
*  shut down and everybody's got to back out of here. So we had to shut down everything and back out for
*  like about an hour, at least a half hour while these bees communicated with each other. So they're
*  flying a giant swarm of them flying in the eye, in the air, trying to figure out why, hey, what
*  are you guys here for? What are you doing? Why are you in our neighborhood? Like, oh, we're not
*  moving in. We're just filming a TV show. Like they had to work it out. That is so unusual.
*  It was really weird. That's extraordinary. So when a new queen splits from a hive, a colony,
*  they then take a big group of them with them. So it's all about protecting the queen. I still
*  understand how they worked it out. There was no fight to the death. There was no nothing. They
*  just sort of worked it out. And the other bees took off and the bees that were there came back
*  to their hive, their little colony. Yeah, that's, there's a lot of this. This is also, well, that's,
*  I'm glad you mentioned that because there's also speaks to what's called bee drift. And so when we
*  publish our article in Nature Scientific Reports, actually, I think the data is understated because
*  10 to up to 20% of bees will drift from one colony to another. So we had treatment colonies,
*  and we had treated colonies. Well, because 10 to 20% of the bees in the treated colonies went to
*  the control colonies, we actually diluted the differential because we had cross movement of
*  control bees and beehive versus treated bees. And so when we actually, I think another, some of my
*  other co-authors thinks we actually have understated the data. But when you look at the P values of
*  significance, you know, they're extraordinary. P is less than 0.009. And that for scientists is
*  an extraordinarily significant data set that is clearly showing the evidence that these extracts
*  help the immunity of bees and help them be able to survive and do a better job. That's awesome.
*  And it's crazy that it's just a natural mushroom, but it makes sense what you're saying that they
*  built their beehives in these rotting trees, knowing that these fungi were there, or somehow
*  or another being attracted to it. You know, I like to say the first five seconds that I got the first
*  patent award, my ego did swell. And then 10 seconds later, I said, Are you frigging kidding?
*  We're neanderthals with nuclear weapons. How could it be the first one to have discovered that bees
*  benefit from mycelium immunologically? But there's no what's called prior art. There's no evidence.
*  And I mean, think of that. We have the intelligence of nature underneath our feet. And this is
*  something we need to tap into. And the fact that we can show a natural product, you know, if you had
*  HPV, HIV, and you went to a doctor 12 days after having one treatment of these extracts, and your
*  viruses dropped 45,000 to one, any physician would say, Wow, you're doing really well. And this is
*  what we'll be able to see. Now, we've been trying to find what's called the mode of action. How are
*  these viruses actually being reduced? Pugetively, our strongest hypothesis now is as providing
*  essential nutrients that are important for the immune system to activate gene sequences that
*  attack the viruses and give more host defensive immunity of protection of a further infection.
*  Now, does this work with humans as well? Like chaga is supposed to be good for your immune system,
*  right? Well, it says this is a great convergence. So traditional Chinese medicine and European
*  medicine and medicine from indigenous peoples all over the world have been using these mushrooms is
*  that now we're finding scientific evidence that folklorically the reputation of chaga of reishi
*  of these mushrooms helping the immunity of humans. This is translational medicine. So, but bees
*  is an animal clinical study. These have been stated as being besides for softala, the second
*  most well studied animal in the world. This is a animal clinical study past digestion, past was
*  called the cytokine P450 pathway, which is your detoxification pathway, mostly in our liver,
*  all animals use the cytokine P450 pathway to break down toxins and it's passed the microbiome
*  into the blood. So this is actually, this is an animal clinical study. And I think it's a gateway
*  for us to take this as credible evidence that natural products can be more useful and offer
*  a broader bio shield of benefits than pure pharmaceuticals that go after one molecule with
*  one target, one set of receptors. There are immunological fields that developed in the
*  complexity of nature. This is what our foods are. This is we are in constant biomolecular
*  communication with the ecosystem. We've evolved in this complex molecular environment. And so
*  our immune systems are upregulated through multiple stimuli. And that's why I think these
*  extracts because of their complexity, they build upon the complexity of natural systems that help
*  our immune system. So you have hope that this is something that we could eventually see being like
*  a peer reviewed proven thing for human beings as well. Absolutely. I do believe that's on the near
*  event horizon. There's a lot of researchers now. I believe it's on the near event horizon is
*  something that we're going to see more and more. There's lots of clinical studies. I thought for
*  physicians, it's not no branding, no selling of anything. It's a popular website called
*  mushroom references.com. I populate specifically for physician physicians. I just spoke at
*  Singularity University, Stanford Medical School in front of a thousand physicians.
*  I try to make the bridge of the credibility of the science for physicians who are just not educated
*  yet because they don't have the resources or the time. So mushroom references.com, you can go to
*  that website. It's got hundreds of references that then you can put in any symptom or species,
*  et cetera, and you'll be able to find the peer reviewed references. There's about 30 references,
*  for instance, on psilocybin right now, which is an area of research that I'm particularly focused on.
*  Now, there was for a long time a stigma associated with anything that had anything to do with
*  mushrooms, particularly because of psychedelic mushrooms. Is that alleviated? I know the John
*  Hopkins study on psilocybin has shown some pretty incredible benefits and there's a lot of people
*  now that are starting to look to it for treatment for people with PTSD or addiction issues. Has that
*  become more mainstream in your experience? No, there's a vast title change in medical science.
*  These are just a few of the universities right now that have been approved by the FDA
*  and other agencies for human clinical studies on psilocybin. Wow. So we're looking at Harvard,
*  Stanford. Yeah. Purdue, Penn, Toronto, University of Toronto. That's amazing. So that's only a few
*  of them. I actually could put a- Department of Veterans Affairs. That's very interesting as well,
*  right? I could put up 20 more, but you couldn't read them because I had to be able to adjust to
*  be able. So this is a huge shift and the clinical studies are coming out for, as you know, PTSD in
*  particular has been extremely useful, but one of them that came out, Johns Hopkins for breaking
*  tobacco addiction, 15 patients, small clinical studies, statistically significant, 10 out of 15
*  people after one or two heroic doses of psilocybin 12 months later had not smoked a cigarette. Wow.
*  So I mean, to break tobacco addiction, which is one of the most addictive substances on this planet,
*  is phenomenal. That's incredible. And the other research for PTSD, depression, I'm really excited
*  about cognition and creativity. I think we can, there's a lot of smart people out there,
*  a lot of smart people listening to your podcast. I think the idea of microdosing and being able to
*  increase our ability of cognition and creativity to come up with the solutions that can get us out
*  of this mess. Just think of that. If we had hundreds of millions of people thinking about
*  solutions like I've come up with to solve some of the environmental challenges we have today for
*  food biosecurity, the loss of bees is a threat to our national security. Just think about the
*  threat to our economy. So this microdosing, I think has enormous potential as well. And when you think
*  about the, one of the issues I see right now with the clinical studies is like almost is too good to
*  be true. The statistically significant, great universities, great science, published in peer
*  reviewed journals, the top of their game. But these mushrooms have so many benefits
*  for fighting dementia, potentially Alzheimer's. Johns Hopkins has an Alzheimer clinical study
*  ongoing currently for a dose of psilocybin to see if it helps pre-Alzheimer's patients and not go
*  into full-blown Alzheimer's. There's so many different benefits potentially. It's almost like
*  a chaos of data. How it's almost too good to be true. So my team and Pam Chrisco is an MD from
*  British Columbia. We've been working with people and we have just launched today an app that's at
*  microdose.me, the montandre. microdose.me is available on the Apple store. It's available on
*  Droid. And this is a quick little- Wait a minute, a microdosing study on Mo- and Apple allowed this
*  on the app store? Yep. That's a big shift. And it's up today. Because this is a schedule one drug
*  that they're talking about taking on microdose levels. I mean, I'm just saying what it is,
*  right? I mean, obviously, you know what camp I'm in. I want everybody to do it. But this is really
*  significant. It measures your ability to hear, vision, the tap test, you know, and how quickly
*  you can tap your fingers. It's whether you're stacking it with, but it's also good for non
*  psychoactive substance use. What is your baseline? So you're getting older, I'm getting older.
*  I'm getting younger dude. I have a new thing. Okay.
*  I vote for you. I figured it out. But the idea is to create baselines, you know, and then you
*  create a baseline over time. So you find out how far you deteriorated. Or what your trendline is,
*  versus the general population. So the idea with the microdose.me is that we'll create a massive
*  data set, massive amount of data. And then we'll offer this to clinicians for them to see signal
*  from the noise. I suspect hypothetically, I don't have the evidence, but several doctors have
*  collected case studies of tinnitus or tinnitus, though the pronunciations are correct, of the
*  buzzing in your ears and being able, and people have resolved that from doing microdosing.
*  Really?
*  And 30% of Americans have hearing loss or more is progressive over time. How much hearing loss
*  leads to depression because you can't hear your loved one say things and you get in arguments and
*  I didn't hear you and you didn't say that. And I mean, it just ramifies out. So the ability of
*  being able to have better cognition, a better neurological development, and helping hearing,
*  vision, depression. The interesting thing about the microdosing that we've been collecting
*  is that people tend to be happier and they're happier when they're more creative,
*  and when they're more creative, they're happier. You're learning a new cotta,
*  you are excited the next day, you nailed it, you're up and going to do it again,
*  you're writing a new book, you're doing an artist's work. So creativity breeds happiness,
*  happiness breeds creativity. And then the opposite is true. Malaysian depression,
*  you're not as creative, you're not enjoying life, you're not looking forward to the next day.
*  So I think it's almost a binary choice and the idea of using microdosing.
*  And then the definition of microdosing has sort of variable interpretations. So
*  the use of the psilocybe cubensis scale, which is the most common psilocybe mushroom in the world,
*  one gram is liftoff. Five grams is what Terrence would say was a hero's journey.
*  And when I was on last, I did with you, I did 20 grams. You know, that was a little bit much,
*  you might say. But when you do one tenth of a one gram, you don't feel it. One 20th, for sure,
*  you don't feel it. So the idea is you do microdosing below the threshold of intoxication,
*  but then it benefits neurogenesis. Now there's an extraordinarily interesting study that came out
*  with mice, but I think it's translational medicine. And they were doing microdosing
*  versus macrodosing. So these are some numbers, but basically one gram is almost equivalent to
*  one milligram per kilogram of body weight. 70 kilos is 152 pounds. And so at one milligram
*  per kilogram of these mice, that's like one gram of cubensis. That's a dose. It's not a super high
*  dose, but it's a dose. So what they did with these mice is they had them in an arena with a metal
*  floor and they gave a tone. Then 40 seconds later, they were shocked. So they had the tone again,
*  a few minutes later. 40 seconds later, they got shocked. After 10 rotations, the mice realized,
*  like Pavlov's dog, when there is a tone, there's going to be a negative consequence, a shock
*  happening, so the mice would cower in fear. So then they dosed them with a microdose,
*  0.1 milligrams per kilogram versus one milligram per kilogram, one tenth of a dose versus a full
*  dose. Interestingly, the full dose, it took 10 rotations of no shock, the tone, no shock before
*  they forgot or became reacclimated not to have the fear condition response. With the microdose,
*  one tenth of that, it only took two rotations, two rotations with a microdose, and they dissociated
*  potentially PTSD. Why do you think it's less? Well, that's a really good question. And the
*  evidence we have so far, and again, this is very early evidence, lots of research is going on in
*  this, it looks like the neurogenic benefits of microdosing are greater than the neurogenic
*  benefits of macrodosing. You flood the receptors, you're having this incredible trip, it's fantastic,
*  it's colorful, it's life-changing. Yes, that is all beneficial for changing your life. But
*  doing microdosing over the long term, because the nerves don't regrow in six hours,
*  but over weeks of regeneration of nerves with microdosing, it seems to me that the microdosing,
*  instead of flooding and overwhelming all the receptors, are feeding these receptors,
*  allowing for neurogenesis. Now, this is, again, a hypothesis. There's so many great people studying
*  this right now, but I'm advocating to all of the clinicians at Johns Hopkins, at Stanford, UCLA,
*  at Harvard, please do testing of the patients for hearing and vision and other behavioral tests
*  that are not just about emotion and mood and PTSD, but let's actually get some physical
*  measurements. So then you can track prior, during is too complicated, it's too much intervention,
*  you're tripping your brains out, you don't have time to be tested for vision and audit. But then
*  post-wise, and then looking at the residual effects. Now, Dr. James Fadiman, he has the
*  Fadiman protocol, my protocol, the Stamets protocol. James Fadiman's protocol was microdosing
*  one day on, two days off, one day's on. My protocol that I'm suggesting is four days on,
*  three days off. And James and I are good friends, we talk about this, we laugh, and we're just,
*  basically, these are hypothetical potential treatments.
*  Are you comparing data between the two of you?
*  This is what microdose.me will do. We wanted to say, are you following the Stamets protocol,
*  the Fadiman protocol, your own protocol? Are you using it with niacin? Are you using it with
*  Lion's Mane? What are you using it with? Lion's Mane is phenomenally powerful neurogenically.
*  And there's two clinical studies out of Japan with mild cognitive decline and dementia,
*  showing very positive results, taking two to four grams of Lion's Mane per day, the mycelium.
*  Interesting, not the fruit bite, the mycelium is much more powerful. And we just have been
*  contracting with a neurological testing laboratory in France, and we just got some amazing results
*  back, showing that when we had Lion's Mane extracts of the mycelium exposed to neurons,
*  and the positive control was the brain-derived nerve growth factor, nerve factor, and it was
*  as used as a baseline for measuring neurogenic compounds comparatively. And the neurogenesis
*  benefits from, this is where pluripotent stem cells, stem cells that then differentiate in the
*  neurons, and the BDNF clearly shows that, it's a standard protocol. With Lion's Mane, it also
*  increased the number of neurons. And then we started looking at analogs of psilocybin,
*  and the analogs, when we added the Lion's Mane mycelium with the psilocybin analogs,
*  which are perfectly legal, they're not schedule one substances.
*  Psilocybin analogs are not? What is exactly a psilocybin analog?
*  There's a number of them that have been reported in the literature. There's Baocystin
*  and norebaocystin are two of the more prominent ones. Now, I'm a psychonaut, and in 1960, Baocystin,
*  a report of a child died outside of Kelso, Washington, from eating mushrooms in his yard.
*  The family ingested the mushrooms. They went to the hospital. The child developed a fever,
*  eventually had renal failure, and died. A chemist by the name of Lung, and then Benedict and Tyler
*  picked up on this. They analyzed the mushrooms looking for a new toxin. The mushrooms were
*  identified as being psilocybe baocystis. It is a mushroom that goes in Washington State and Oregon,
*  sometimes in British Columbia, but not in Northern California. It's a very rare species,
*  but grows in yards. When they analyzed the mushroom looking for new potential toxins,
*  they found this alkaloid. It's a dimethyltrypimine-based compound, and they named it Baocystin
*  after psilocybe baocystis. So, Baocystin had the reputation of potentially being a deadly
*  poisonous toxin. It's present in cubensis, it's present in many psilocybe mushrooms, and my book,
*  Silscibe Mushrooms of the World, has charts that show how much Baocystin is in these things.
*  But no one had ever consumed Baocystin because of this reputation. Baocystin is legal. I obtained
*  some pure Baocystin from a laboratory, legally. I have no psilocybin. Nature provides, I don't,
*  people. I'm making this very clear. But I can possess these psilocybin analogues.
*  Since there was no reports in the scientific literature of whether this was truly toxic or
*  not, I, with a doctor friend of mine, an MD, that measured my vitals and hooked me up to blood
*  pressure, ECG, did all the biometrics that are needed. And so we did an N of 1 study. I decided
*  that even though it had a history of potentially killing this child, I think that's a false positive.
*  I think it was bad science. I couldn't find no one who ever ingested this, so I decided I would
*  ingest it. Now, my friend Pam, she's an MD that goes into Antarctica. She's the only doctor on
*  a research vessel. And so she goes down there and she gets to bring a roommate. That was me.
*  And so Pam and I were working really hard. We had all of our plane tickets. We're ready to go to
*  Antarctica. We had been planning this for months. And then we decided, well, just before we go,
*  Paul, let's do the Baocystin test. We'd talked about this for months. We finally got the time
*  to do this, but the next day we're going to Antarctica. So Pam looks at her cell phone,
*  this Russian research vessel crashed into a reef, tore a hole in it. And it's like, now the trip is
*  canceled. I mean, American Express, plane tickets, hotels, I got 24 hours to try to recapture all this
*  money because we can't go. The trips are canceled. So I had super high anxiety. And I told my doctor
*  friend, I have too much anxiety. I can't go. This is too crazy. And then she kind of looked at me,
*  gone, listen, we've been planning this for months. Please. And I listened to her. And so I did 10
*  milligrams of Baocystin. She measured my heartbeat, blood pressure, all those metrics. My eyes did
*  dilate. She said that was good. So she had a drug-like effect. And then she checked in with me every
*  10, 15 minutes. 20 minutes, you usually have liftoff, one hour, you're full blown into it.
*  And she checked with me and she checked with me. And she asked, and I didn't get high. I'm not a
*  law. She goes, how do you feel? And I said, I feel great. I have no anxiety. Everything with this
*  trip is going to be fine. So here we found a analog of psilocybin that does not get you high.
*  That's legal. That reduced anxiety. I think this is the tip of the proverbial iceberg,
*  because all the clinical studies are approved right now for pure psilocybin. What about the
*  analogs? They activate other receptor sites in your neurological field. And that's why I think
*  this is why looking at the natural form of these mushrooms standardized to the psilocybin, a certain
*  concentration versus the pure molecule, I think that is the way of the future because pure psilocybin
*  is up to $6,000, $7,000 a gram. And you can translate that into growing psilocybin mushrooms
*  for $2 a gram. Now there are people out there listening saying, well, the price is coming down.
*  Indeed, it is. It's down maybe to $1,000 to $500 a gram. But how many people in the urban,
*  lower income, impoverished population suffering from PTSD who can't afford to go to Johns Hopkins
*  to spend tens of thousands of dollars to have a clinical treatment? I think this democratizes
*  the use of psilocybin and microdosing that could be a benefit across our society. And then my
*  proposal is you stack it with niacin. And the reason why you stack it with niacin is you take
*  one tenth of a gram of psilocybin-cubensis, microdose, you add 100 to 200 milligrams of niacin.
*  Now, if someone tries to get high by taking 10 times as much, they'll have like two grams of
*  niacin. This is flushing niacin, vitamin B3. And that flushing niacin will give you such an
*  irritable reaction of skin itching of people who've taken vitamin B3. They know this. So it becomes
*  the antibuse for microdosing. But moreover, it excites the nerves at the end of the peripheral
*  nervous system. And neuropathies oftentimes present themselves as a deadening of the nerves
*  of the fingertips and toes. And it's also a vasodilator. So there's three attributes of
*  stacking niacin with psilocybin mushrooms. It prevents abuse, becomes the antibuse. It
*  dilates the blood vessels to deliver the neurogenic benefits of psilocybin to the endpoints of the
*  peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. And it then also excites the nerve
*  endings. So I think those three reasons, I hope to see in the future psilocybin mushrooms being
*  over-the-counter vitamins approved by the FDA, stacked with niacin that allows for the universality
*  of use for the benefit of our culture. What we were talking last time... Can I pause here for a second?
*  Is there any other evidence of people taking these analogs and having this anti-anxiety effect other
*  than you? I mean, this seems a very small sample size, right? It's just one person.
*  Yes, there are. As an antidepressant, as far as anxiety and depression are interrelated,
*  there are reports. James Fadiman, in his studies, his population study, which is admittedly small,
*  did not see an anti-anxiety component. But other clinical studies at Johns Hopkins also,
*  the anxiety of dying from cancer.
*  Right, but that was actually psilocybin.
*  That was actually psilocybin.
*  What I'm saying with you is also you had a very profoundly stressful situation happening,
*  something you had prepared for for a long time, then all of a sudden it was gone,
*  and all this money's gone. You've got to try to figure out how to get it back. It's immediate.
*  Maybe with these other people, they didn't have such an immediate anxiety moment,
*  and maybe their anxiety was harder to measure whether it was coming or going.
*  Well, absolutely. It's the end of one study. This is just...
*  How many people?
*  Me.
*  No, the other one with the other people that have experienced it but didn't experience any
*  anti-anxiety.
*  There's no one else that we know in the scientific literature.
*  Johann Garz mentions, I published philosophy as a residence with him,
*  the most potent psilocybin mushroom in the world. Johann Garz says in one thing that he was asked,
*  and he said that the Bayes system was equal to that of psilocybin. I don't have high confidence
*  in that statement. I can say the Bayes system, I was ready for liftoff. I was hoping for liftoff.
*  I know what liftoff feels like, and I didn't get it. So what happens in science so much is
*  the scientists, when you can't do a clinical study, we bioassay. This is very common. This
*  is how Albert Hofmann discovered LSD. He bioassayed it.
*  Didn't he do it accidentally though?
*  He did it accidentally, right. He got in and went for this famous bike ride, but then he did it
*  purposely after that. But nevertheless, this is what our scientific, you know,
*  psychonauts must do sometimes.
*  Sascha Schultz.
*  Yeah, Sascha Schultz.
*  Famous for it.
*  The most famous of all and the most revered. And he bioassayed based on his knowledge of chemistry.
*  He wasn't going to try to commit suicide. So this is really an area that I think has enormous
*  value. Several meta studies have come out. One that I had mentioned before is a population of
*  several hundred thousand prisoners. And there was an 18% reduction in violent crime and 22% or so
*  a reduction in larceny and theft in a population where they reported they had one psilocybin
*  mushroom experience. And statistically significant. Now, association may not be causation,
*  but it can be. But a more recent study from British Columbia, which I find to be so fascinating,
*  is that they did a large population set and partner to partner violence. If your male partner
*  had done one psilocybin trip to statistically significant reduction of the probability
*  of that partner being violent towards their other partner. Statistically significant.
*  So I always thought that there's a dating app. Maybe you should have the dating app. Have you
*  tripped on psilocybin? Yes. Well, that may be a better candidate for dating. So I think psilocybin
*  makes nicer people. And I think we get a lot more nicer people that are more creative,
*  that are dedicated to helping the community. And I think this is a potential paradigm shifting
*  drug. Unquestionably. And here's the other thing. This could be profit.
*  These companies that are seeking to profit off of pharmaceutical drugs, you can profit off this
*  stuff, particularly with the protocol that you just described with adding niacin to it to ensure
*  that people are doing only microdosing. Look, man, this could be a very profitable enterprise
*  for some company. And the benefits, if people can mirror the benefits that you had of this
*  alleviation of anxiety. My God, that's like most of what people struggle with. So many people out
*  there listening to this right now are like, fuck, I wish there was something that didn't get me high,
*  but just alleviated this fucking angst that so many people are struggling with every day.
*  I'd say it's a massive disease complex that swept our societies. And facing all these problems,
*  how could you not become depressed? Well, you cannot become depressed by becoming creative.
*  And I think that psilocybin and microdosing enables the creative pathways for ingenuity,
*  for us to feel that we have meaning. We can make a meaningful difference. And it's really important.
*  And we've entered into 6X, the sixth greatest extinction event known in the history of life
*  on this planet. We've had two other extinction events from asteroid impacts 250 million years
*  ago, 65 million years ago, but we're now involved in a massive extinction event.
*  And the research that came out today and the other research has come out with 75% of the
*  insect population, 40% in immediate jeopardy. The research article came out in Europe and North
*  America, they have good data collection. Amazon, they don't. So we don't even have a measure of
*  the insect loss in the Amazon. But if you're a trout, if you're a bird, if you like drinking
*  coffee and you like chocolate and you like almonds, I mean, these are all dependent upon pollinators.
*  So if we lose these flying insects, we lose the pollination services and it threatens worldwide
*  food biosecurity. This is one of the biggest threats to our ecosystem now. I think we can
*  invent our ways out of this if we creatively expand our ability to come up with novel solutions.
*  And I think the solutions are literally underfoot and all around us today. We just have to wake up
*  like I woke up to helping the bees. There are so many smart people out there. If they just started
*  realizing that nature is a deep well of evolutionary knowledge and that we have evolved
*  within this complexity, then to delve into that library of knowledge and pulling out
*  applicable solutions vetted by science, controlled studies, but not looking at these pharmaceutical
*  pure molecules as the way of the future, but looking at upon the complexity of the microbiome,
*  the complex interrelationships and selecting out microbiomes that then create guilds of solutions
*  that are applicable to the problems that we face today.
*  Pete Slauson All right. I like that idea.
*  Kevin O'Rourke All of it. It's just, it's beautiful that there are these natural solutions
*  that, you know, maybe if we could just shift people's ideas about how we view psilocybin,
*  how we view the analogs, how we view the interaction with people in nature, that you can,
*  you know, we can make a real change, make a change that's tangible inside of our lifetime.
*  And again, selling this stuff, like if, look, we're seeing what's happening right now with
*  medical marijuana and then shifting to commercial marijuana and now hemp. It's giant. I mean,
*  it's a huge industry through, it's changed Colorado. Colorado, Denver's real estate's
*  gone through the roof. People are moving there so much that they've got traffic problems now
*  they never conceived of in the past. It's changed their economy and it's changed their economy due
*  to just a really obvious shift. Here's the shift, marijuana's not bad for you. It's not. We thought
*  it was. It's not. We're sorry. You can have it now and now you could sell it and now it's legal.
*  But federally, we're still dealing with schedule one. So it's, it's, these shifts are happening.
*  These companies are investing money. There's a lot of profit to be made and a lot of people
*  are profiting, but it's still in this weird transitionary stage. It is, but this is a
*  people's revolution. You have decriminalized nature coming out of Oakland, which I'm fully
*  in favor of. How dare we make a species illegal? That makes no sense to me.
*  Pete Slauson What is Oakland specifically? They've made ayahuasca, psilocybin, what else?
*  John Sussman All natural products with psychoactive properties,
*  to the best of my understanding, both Denver and Oakland, they remove the funding
*  for prosecutors and judges in the courts. So you can't use public funds
*  in order to prosecute people for possession. So this is a very –
*  Pete Slauson Can you still arrest them for it though?
*  John Sussman Well, the law enforcement officer is not getting paid, he's not doing his job,
*  he's violating his code of conduct. You arrest them and you take them to a prosecutor,
*  the prosecutor goes, I have no funding for this. You're wasting our time. You're just coming here
*  is wasting my time. I have murders that's to solve.
*  Pete Slauson What if someone's selling it?
*  Decriminalization does not, it doesn't prevent you from being prosecuted for selling a schedule.
*  John Sussman That's a really, really good question and I have
*  thoughts on it that's controversial because this speaks to the ability of some people having access
*  and not. If you want – I only trip on psilocybin mushrooms once or twice a year.
*  That's all I need. As Terrence McKenna and I think Alan Watts say, when you get the message
*  from the phone, hang it up. So if you just have these psilocybin mushrooms growing in your
*  backyard or you know how to collect them, then you only need one or two doses a year
*  and even microdosing, you know, you get a lot more extension of that.
*  But my view and I've never had any problem with law enforcement. In Washington, Oregon,
*  in British Columbia, in Canada in particular, law enforcement has a very pretty mature attitude
*  towards this. If you have a small amount and you're not trafficking and you're for individual use,
*  it just doesn't raise the level of the need for enforcement.
*  Alan Watts No, I understand that, but I just wish there was no incentive at all. There was
*  nothing there. Like just the idea that you have to rely on the good grace of a cop who understands
*  that there's no incentive to arrest you. That seems like horse shit to me. Like we're growing
*  adults in 2019 with a mountain of evidence. This is not – we're not living in the dark ages anymore.
*  And the fact that it's still a possibility that you get arrested or you could face some sort of
*  criminal charges for having something that's only been demonstrated to be good.
*  Bill Nye This is why the citizens movement, the federal government, I mean, the Republicans
*  and conservatives and libertarians are all about state rights. This is a people's movement. They
*  should get behind this because individual community rights against the big man, against
*  the federal government. The federal government, there needs to be a title change. And how do we
*  do that is because we have decriminalized nature in Oregon. We have the Denver Initiative, other
*  cities around the country. It's now spreading throughout the entire country. There's probably
*  20 cities in the next 16 months that are going to have decriminalization at the city councils.
*  Alan Watts I also think it's a significant solution to this problem that we're facing
*  with pills and a lot of destructive drugs. There's a lot of self-destructive drugs that people are
*  taking because these people are hurting. What psilocybin gives you, that these drugs don't,
*  it gives you a potential to heal. It gives you a moment to reflect. It gives you a change in the
*  way you think and you interface with the world. And that just doesn't exist in those other drugs.
*  Those drugs are escape drugs. And the need to escape is what we got to eliminate. And I think
*  that's one of the things that psilocybin can help. It can help alleviate the need to escape.
*  Bill Nye And a shout out to Rick Doblin and Leanna Galulli.
*  MAPS.org, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. MAPS.org and MAPS.ca in Canada
*  have been instrumental in bringing forward psychedelic drugs for PTSD and clinical studies.
*  And MAPS is now in phase three.
*  Alan Watts With MDMA.
*  Bill Nye With MDMA.
*  Alan Watts I've had Rick on a couple of times. I love that guy.
*  Bill Nye So yeah, he's a real pioneer in this. And so
*  what's interesting in getting now from three different groups I've heard who've sat down with
*  FDA scientists, there's been a new turnover within the FDA. And these scientists are looking at just
*  pure science without politics. They don't care about politics. They want to help people. And
*  several of them have said they've never seen with psilocybin in particular, a safer drug with such
*  a dramatic impact. So it's in frequency of use one or two times. And so there is a movie that
*  just came out called Fantastic Fungi. And Michael Pollan's in there. I'm in there.
*  Louis Schwartzberg has put it out. He spent 12 years working on this movie. It's fantasticfungi.com.
*  It's a grassroots movement. Theaters are selling out all over the country. They book it in New
*  York City for one night. They have to keep it in for a week because they're standing room,
*  long lines to get into the theater. And it's all about the use of mushrooms and the Johns Hopkins
*  studies with end of life patients. It's very, very well done. But it speaks to this is that
*  this is literally a quote unquote underground movement that's welling up. And the attraction
*  that people have for this is a reflection of the tidal change that is happening now.
*  This is a worldwide movement that is sweeping through the mycelial underground and through
*  connections. So something I'd very much encourage you to see Fantastic Fungi.
*  Is it on Netflix?
*  It's not on Netflix. Louis was offered a lot of money for Netflix. But once it gets in Netflix,
*  it's a library book in the library. And he wanted to build community. So he's been out
*  and people can sponsor theater openings. It's got 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. How many movies
*  get 100% on Rotten Tomatoes? So it is really a people's movie and it's spreading.
*  Where can you get it?
*  You go to fantasticfungi.com and you can sign up for theaters.
*  So it has to be in a theater?
*  Yeah, right now. It will be eventually after this year. It's going to be available on the web.
*  Right now, Louis spent a lot of money, about $4 or $5 million, I think. Norman and Lynn Lear,
*  Norman Lear, all in the family, Archie Bunker. They're also co-producers of this.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And so, yeah, Lynn Lear.
*  Norman Lear's out there tripping?
*  Allegedly?
*  I cannot.
*  Here it is. Are you ready to explore the magic that lives beneath our feet? Wow.
*  I thought Archie Bunker was one of the most lovable, racist, conservative
*  assholes I've ever seen on TV.
*  Well, Norman Lear did a lot more than that. This is really interesting, though, that they've
*  decided to release it in film theaters versus on the web. Because if you really want to reach
*  a lot of people, is it selling this way? It seems like if you spent a lot of money,
*  the way to get that money back would be to sell it to Netflix.
*  Well, I would agree with you, except Netflix.
*  Or Amazon?
*  Netflix offered him one quarter to one half of the cost. And so, it was not, they didn't value it
*  and they didn't see it. I mean, South by Southwest turned them down and it's got 100% on Rotten
*  Tomatoes. I mean, people just don't see this.
*  Why did South by Southwest turn them down?
*  Because it's not part, I think, of the Hollywood establishment.
*  South by Southwest?
*  So, I can't explain why South by Southwest turned it down or the other festivals.
*  The con festival, etc. That's not my level of expertise. But what is happening is that
*  these theaters are selling out days upon days in a huge response. People have an appetite for this
*  because it gives them hope and meaning. In a time of desperation, they see actionable solutions
*  that cross political and cultural boundaries that can help the commons. And I think that we
*  are suffering in our societies from the media, from the politics, from the science showing the
*  loss of habitat health, that we're under lots of stressors just like the bees are. We have a
*  multiplicity of stressors and these stressors lead to malaise, depression, disease, crime and
*  poverty. And this is something that I think can help do a tidal change for the better,
*  provided it's done responsibly.
*  Now, you've mentioned companies. There's 20, at least, new psilocybin companies that have been
*  formed in the past year. A lot of them from the Canadian cannabis industry. They made a ton of
*  money. Several of them called me up. I've talked to two groups and both groups when I asked them,
*  have you done a heroic dose on psilocybin? None of them would admit that they did.
*  They're scared.
*  They hadn't even tripped.
*  What?
*  I asked them, have you done a small dose? They said, and then we went silent. And at one group,
*  I said, you folks just seem like economic opportunists. And one of them said, that's
*  exactly what we are. We just try to make money.
*  Just make a deal with them. Listen, I need one afternoon of your time.
*  I think it's important that we-
*  Come to Jesus.
*  Yeah, that's a different subject.
*  I mean, it would be amazing, right? Do that and say, look, I'll do this deal with you, but just
*  give me five hours. You take the five hours, have them all trip together and now go, let's
*  reevaluate this.
*  I'm with you. I'm with you, brother. And that's what's needed because those of us who understand
*  the importance of this realize that this is something that we have to carefully
*  shepherd for maximum benefit. And at these commercialization of these companies,
*  I call it spore wars. Very soon, there's going to be spore wars.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  Between all these companies.
*  Sounds like a good movie. That's a sequel. Spore wars.
*  But listen, man, what's exciting to me is it's not dirty anymore. Okay? The first time I did
*  mushrooms, I think was very, very early 2000s. And God, you tell people about it. They were like,
*  what's wrong with you? You're a grown adult. You pay taxes.
*  All my life.
*  It's like, what kind of a fuck up are you? At your age, you're doing mushrooms? My God,
*  grow up. That's what it was like. And you would tell them, no, I don't think that's what it is.
*  I think it expands your consciousness. I think it connects you to higher levels of thinking.
*  And it just makes you more in tuned with the great beyond. There's something more there.
*  And I'm like, you listen to yourself. Go to work. Go goddamn, get up in the morning and have a cup
*  of coffee and go to work. But now it's people are slowly but surely the dirtiness of even.
*  And then the term micro dosing is wonderful because people know you can take a little bit,
*  you know, like we've micro dosed on this podcast for Ari and I just took a couple stems recently.
*  And then like, I guess it's probably a little more than micro dose. It was a, it was a pretty,
*  we were, we were definitely noticeably high, but like an hour in and like an hour and a half in,
*  I go, I forgot we took mushrooms. I'm like, why am I so happy? But that feeling it's like,
*  I want people to experience that feeling because it's a, it's a relatively clean feeling.
*  And I, after mushrooms, I feel younger. Yeah. I go to these Ted conferences every year and I
*  feel lighter. I feel like I was treated like a leper, you know, and I went to Ted, you know,
*  and the organism were Ted were so afraid of him. Talk about psychedelic mushrooms. How many years
*  ago was this? The 2008 when I first went. What's it like now though? That's right. This last time,
*  I mean, I was treated like a super celebrity. I had, I had these hugely, hugely powerful people,
*  some of the names you probably know who came up to me and would shake my shoulders going,
*  now I understand. Now I understand. And I was like, how does that say a down boy, you know,
*  keep down. And they, they, they awoke into something and their, their mates, their friends,
*  their business associates, you know, there seems the common theme is, wow, he was such a jerk
*  before and he's so nice now. Yeah. And they seek in cooperation and they still are productive.
*  They're still are creative. They're banging it out. The coders in Silicon Valley know that
*  microdosing helps their coding ability. So it's a competitive advantage to those other
*  computer companies that do not, you know, I think any, any new business populated in particular by
*  young people who are not doing microdosing are going to be a competitive disadvantage
*  because the creativity flow, the camaraderie of the community, seeking to benefit the commons
*  and also reward yourself. I'm not saying it's all, you know, just, just helping, helping the
*  commons, but the idea of being able to reward yourself and people rejoice and your success,
*  and they benefit from it as well. It really integrates people together.
*  Yeah. And it's also people need to understand that there's a lot of this squirreling away
*  resources and money and things and, and trying to climb that corporate ladder.
*  This is a finite life. It doesn't last that long. It's a trick. You get sucked into this
*  trick and this trick is what every CEO and every head of every corporation, every chief financial
*  officer, all these people that are just trying to like improve the bottom line, rake in more money,
*  keep this company growing and keep kicking ass. It's a trick. You're sucked up in a trick. There's
*  a natural human tendency to accumulate numbers for whatever reason, go back to our early days
*  when resources were scarce. And if you get sucked into that trick one day, you're going to wake up
*  and that that's going to be usually be too late. You usually it's on your deathbed. Usually it's
*  close to it. Like, what did I do? This is it. My health is failing. My life's falling apart.
*  And what has my life been? It's been 10, 12, 14 hours a day in these stuffed offices under
*  fluorescent lights, crunching numbers and trying to acquire things. And for what? Like what impact
*  have I made on humans? What is the negative impact of my ambition on the people that around me?
*  Like all of this is like the one thing that psilocybin and particularly just psychedelics
*  in general can provide is a break from patterns, a stopping, a ceasefire of all the momentum of our
*  culture, civilization, finances, taxes, credit card debt, all that shit just stops and you get
*  a chance to step back and look at the machine, watch it all whirl and spin in front of you.
*  And you get to say, Oh, I got sucked into the trick. I'm sucked into a trick.
*  Pete Slauson A lot of people I've talked to exactly what you're talking, you're mentioning,
*  and they did do a heroic journey and they then look back and going, why was I prioritizing that?
*  I want to be out with my children and looking at birds or walking in the woods.
*  Pete Larkin Being in nature, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Being in nature. One of my books,
*  Silscibe Mushrooms of the World, has a great chapter in it, I think, called
*  Good Tips for Great Trips. And one of the things I understand the clinically controlled settings
*  for clinical studies, etc. A lot of us don't need that. But I really enjoy
*  being on an ocean bluff or a high point and by being in the mushrooms about a half an hour before
*  sunset, being with a loved one, also good to have an experienced person who's not tripping,
*  who is the watcher.
*  Pete Larkin A sitter.
*  Pete Slauson A sitter. A sitter is there taking
*  meditation practice in place, folks, give these people some space, who's just watching.
*  And then the people who are imbibing understand they have a watcher, they have somebody who's
*  anchored who can help them. And then to have the sun go down and the stars come out and the colors
*  and then this oceanic expansive experience, it's just nothing short of spiritual.
*  Pete Larkin I agree. I think there's one thing we should
*  talk about though. There are people that have a tendency towards schizophrenia. And these people
*  have, sometimes they have psychedelic breaks, like they'll have psychedelic experiences and then
*  they don't do well. They go off to defacto.
*  Pete Larkin I'm so glad you brought that up. And that is a deselection from the
*  clinical studies of candidates who want to engage. But my good friend Mark Hayden,
*  who runs MAPS Canada, had a very interesting story with a schizophrenic.
*  And he also cautioned, and every physician I know is on the same page as you.
*  Pete Larkin Including medical, not medical marijuana,
*  edible, edible marijuana seems to have a significant effect on people with it.
*  Pete Larkin What Mark noted with this one person who was a severe schizophrenic was that
*  he still heard voices in his head, but the voices now were friendly. They were affirming.
*  They weren't saying, you know, go kill somebody. It was like, you know, you are a good person.
*  Pete Larkin Right.
*  Pete Larkin And so, he still had the voice in the head,
*  but the tenor and tone and attitude of the voices were supportive.
*  Pete Larkin What I'm talking about is it bringing on
*  these schizophrenic experiences. That there has been some evidence, particularly about marijuana,
*  that high doses of marijuana for people that have tendencies, and we don't know,
*  right, what causes someone to have schizophrenic breaks. Because there is a difference between
*  pre and post, right? People have had deteriorating mental health that correlates with schizophrenia.
*  Like, what caused them to be less schizophrenic or not exhibiting any of the problems,
*  and then all of a sudden having severe problems post psychedelic trip or post large dose edible
*  marijuana, or even large dose smoking of some people. They dab and they smoke wax and then
*  it happens to people that smoke too much pot. There's certain people that have that tendency.
*  Mark Snell I would defer to clinicians who are extremely skilled in this area,
*  who have seen many, many patients. I'm not a doctor, but I concur with you. I think that is a
*  real concern. The difference between a toxin and a drug can oftentimes be dose, and at lower doses
*  you can see things at higher doses you don't. So, it's an entire spectrum and it's so complex.
*  Individualities of people are so uniquely different. I have a friend who's a doctor,
*  if he smokes a joint, he can't go to sleep. I smoke a joint and I'm into a cuddle puddle,
*  man. I'm ready for the pillow. At night, I use it for going to sleep.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I'm the opposite. I start writing. I want to read. I want to watch documentaries.
*  Mark Snell But it's a sativa thing too as well, right? Do you have a significant
*  difference between the way your body responds to sativas versus indicas?
*  Mark Slauson I would like to be educated in this subject. I've used both for a very long time.
*  I love indica. You have a beard, I have a beard. I love the smell of cannabis on my beard.
*  Pete Slauson You like the smell on your beard?
*  Mark Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson You weirdo.
*  Mark Slauson It's my perfume, right?
*  Pete Slauson I get it.
*  Mark Slauson But there's a lot, you know, we're in a new realm of pharmacology
*  and pharmacognosy. And this is, I think we have to navigate this carefully.
*  The problem with natural products is how do you standardize them to the active constituent?
*  When you have more than one active constituent, you know, how do you standardize them all?
*  There's an entourage or a symphony effect. This speaks to the complexity of nature. But I have
*  a phrase that I like. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Just because you can't
*  understand it doesn't mean it necessarily does not have a valid outcome or, you know, can't be used.
*  And I think that what we need to do is correct large data sets and that's why I'm hoping
*  microdose.me is going to give us an enormous amount of data that clinicians can harvest from
*  and going, we didn't anticipate this. And like these meta studies about partner to partner
*  violence, when if your partner men had tripped on mushrooms, they were less prone to violence.
*  That was signal from the noise. How many other signals from the noise of these big, big
*  metaphiles that we can pull out, then we can get serious scientists to do really carefully
*  controlled clinical studies to be able to see this. And then how do you combine them? And I mean,
*  there's this whole new landscape that gets away from single molecules into the complexity of
*  nature that we can build upon. Navigating to that place is going to be a challenge. There's
*  no doubt about it. But I think we're smart enough now. We have enough computer technologies and
*  diagnostic tools that we should begin on that voyage today. What do you think is responsible
*  for that shift from Ted of 2008 to Ted of 2019? Michael Pollan's book, probably. Michael Pollan's
*  book was the big bridge. And he has 40 pages on me. And Michael, if you're listening,
*  Buddy, dude, I told him not to reveal my secret mushroom patch. Never trust a journalist. And
*  Michael Pollan blesses heart. I love him. He's a great guy. But he said, in his book, so to speak,
*  he says, Paul told me not to tell you where his secret mushroom patch is. But I can tell you that
*  we slept in a yurt. There are three state parks along the Columbia River, and two of them have
*  yurts. He just basically gave up your spot. And it's like, okay, Michael, why do you do that?
*  I think it's the urge of a writer trying to give something to their readership.
*  You know, so what happened to that spot? Get trampled? It's run over with people collecting
*  salt side mushrooms. They have big signs everywhere. They arrest people. It's a huge
*  income source now for the cops because they bust people. But you know, it's a big thing.
*  It but the good news about that, as I have gone on to these state parks, and because of the big
*  signs of no mushroom picking, and law enforcement's there, there's lots of mushrooms. They're
*  everywhere. And so I can photograph them, but you're not allowed to touch them. So they look,
*  what do they check you on your way out? Oh, they're they're like, bees on honey, so to speak. Come on,
*  they are hiding in the bushes. They are alpha male. Imagine that they've got drugs grown out of the
*  ground. And they're like, they watch it. They swarm. Don't touch it. I had a lot of fun with
*  my friend because I got a stick. And I go, Okay, I touched the mushrooms with a stick. Now, am I
*  actually touching the mushrooms or not? Because if you touch them, check your pockets, they will
*  search you. Yeah, they'll search you for just randomly. No, if they have a reason to believe
*  reason to believe they can search you stuff them in your underwear, bro. Just take a big fat baggie,
*  or swallow them quickly. But um, you know, I don't this is it is preposterous. What if they find you
*  lying down with your eyes dilated? You'd have to talk to them, you know. And I don't know if they
*  would do a fecal sample later on or what Christ, but it approaches the absurd. Yeah, you know,
*  and this is when the law enforcement's because of absurd, even the law enforcement officers, I know,
*  who, you know, you've been in the martial arts a lot all your lives, myself as well. I had several
*  schools for about 30 years. And I had several law enforcement officers as students. Yeah,
*  they don't want to be involved in that nonsense. No, they get roped into it by the system. Yeah,
*  they like like this is not something they want to do. I know a ton of cops, none of them give a
*  shit about mushrooms. So yeah, it's, yeah, it's, it's hugely, hugely unfortunate consequence of
*  really ridiculous laws. And the idea of grown adults telling other grown adults that they can't
*  do something that is incredibly beneficial that they themselves have never experienced, so they
*  have no knowledge of it at all, other than the ancient stereotypes, mushrooms being bad,
*  mushrooms being for burnouts and losers and hippies and all you can't handle life.
*  Or they're walking hypocrites. And they know it, you know, they use it themselves. Yeah.
*  And they're like tormented, but they have to do this. So I found the most law enforcement
*  officer extremely reasonable. Yeah. As long as you show intent, you know, your intention,
*  respect, respect. Yeah, 100%. So it's, it's never been, but, you know, I don't subscribe to the
*  defense that someone's doing for spiritual purposes. And they have, you know, hundreds of
*  pounds with Ziploc bags with scales in the basement and doing a commercial operation. Right.
*  You're avoiding taxes, right? You're producing this as a factory, you know, take it in the chin,
*  you get busted, hey, come to the territory. Yeah. Eyes wide open, don't cloak it in like
*  the veil of spirituality. You're trying to create a spiritual revolution. Unless you're a true saint,
*  you're giving that shit away. Yeah. Well, that would be different. But yeah, I have a phrase,
*  nature provides, I don't, because I don't want to be responsible for another person's experience.
*  Oh, for sure. What if they have a meltdown and they blame Joe Rogan? Yes. Paul Stevens. Yes.
*  I don't, I can't control that circumstance. I don't want the responsibility. That's one of the
*  reasons why I've hesitated on getting involved in medical marijuana or commercial marijuana
*  have been offered. And I'm always like, I just don't think this is the right,
*  because you can't, especially with edibles, you can't control people. You don't know what
*  they're going to do. I don't, I don't do edibles because I, that's hilarious. Well, I was in
*  Kenyon College in 1973. My dad was coming to visit. And one of my people on the floor
*  at this dormitory, they made some marijuana brownies. Oh boy. And I had never taken...
*  A good story starts that way. I ate two brownies. I got, my dad's coming in two or three hours. So
*  what the heck? And I was so frigging stoned. I could not believe it. And I could barely,
*  my eyes were really, I was trying to maintain it, you know, how it is, you're trying to look like
*  you're not stoned, but you're blitzed out of your gourd. And so my dad was like, you're looking at
*  me really curiously. This is early 1970s. And so the next day I said, dad, I got to tell you
*  something. I ate some marijuana brownies. And he goes, I knew something was wrong. I knew that.
*  I could tell. I could tell. He goes, well, no shit, Sherlock. I'm finally on the floor.
*  But it was, but marijuana... Did he get mad at you?
*  No, he was actually amused and delighted that I explained to him why I look so stoned.
*  Oh, well, that's great that you had that kind of communication.
*  Yeah. Just before he died, he wanted to trip on mushrooms. And I turned him down
*  because he was close to the end of his life. And he was very religious. And I was concerned
*  I would shake his reality tree so severely that he would question his entire life,
*  because he was like a Death of the Salesman figure. It was a tragic life that he led.
*  And the mushrooms could have helped him enormously. But I was concerned that he would look back and
*  go, so I wasted my life. So that was too heavy for me. Maybe I'm being selfish because I was
*  trying to protect my own feelings. But he wanted to do it.
*  He asked me, actually, he said, I want to do soul-side mushrooms with you.
*  And he wouldn't smoke pot. Do you have regrets about that, about not doing it with him?
*  I do. I have a lot of regrets about that. So I have met several people in the past several weeks
*  at Stanford Medical School, at these other conferences that I go to, where
*  there's a Brain-Mind Conference at Stanford Medical School. In the first two sentences,
*  they mentioned psilocybin. 120 neuroscientists and $150 billion in the room, and psilocybin was
*  immediately mentioned. And I met some people there that are intergenerational. Grandparent,
*  parent, and 18, 19-year-old child, all journeyed with mushrooms together.
*  And their interpersonal relationships, they told me, there's no reason for us ever to get mad at
*  each other. I just thought that was really powerful. Wow. Yeah, that is powerful. That sounds
*  inconceivable to someone who's never experienced psychedelics, but someone who has, you go,
*  yeah, I see how you could get there. Yeah, don't make mountains out of molehills.
*  You can disagree without being angry, and you can be civil about it.
*  Well, that's a lesson the world could use right now. I think this is, in many ways,
*  the antidote for some of the problems that we're seeing with social media. One of the problems we
*  see with social media is this disconnect from the human experience, disconnect from communication,
*  person-to-person communication, and this anger and vitriol and hate and this rage.
*  Hiding behind screen names and trolls. You're Joe Rogan, I'm Paul Stamets.
*  Well, who are these people hiding behind screen names? And a great TED Talk, which I did not
*  understand, and the TED Talk was fantastic, talking about why trolls do the things that they do.
*  They do it because they get excitement. The idea is just to disturb the fabric, and the more
*  disturbance they get, that is a measure of their success in provoking a response, even though they're
*  not wedded to it. They just want to be able to cause a ripple in the pond.
*  Yeah. Well, they don't feel significant, so they want to do something that they can get some sort
*  of reaction. They have a rock, they see a window, they want to throw it. It's a natural inclination,
*  but it's stupid.
*  It's barbaric.
*  But it's a waste of fucking time. And some people celebrate it. I'm like, okay, celebrate it.
*  You're not doing shit. You're not doing shit for yourself. You're not doing shit for other people.
*  You're not improving whatever your art is, whatever it is that you try to do in this life to
*  leave your mark or to contribute or to be creative. You're not doing that if you're trolling.
*  All trollers should eat mushrooms.
*  Yes. Well, all angry people should eat mushrooms.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  I really agree with that.
*  So, well, there is good evidence that Lion's Mane also compensates in many of these
*  neurogenic benefits that psilocybin does.
*  I think this stuff all the time. This is like a Lion's Mane elixir that I
*  pour. Tell me if that shit's any good.
*  Well, it comes from China.
*  And is that bad?
*  Every Chinese expert I've met, they said I wouldn't dare buy a mushroom from China.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So this is, we have a spoonable Lion's Mane.
*  Let me see what you got.
*  And I put that in smoothies all the time. And that's my go-to. And that's exactly the research.
*  Can I put it in coffee?
*  Yeah, you can put it in coffee. And Jamie, can you pull up that?
*  The neurogenesis benefits of Lion's Mane.
*  How much should I put in here? Ooh, it's open. It's not open yet, right?
*  No.
*  How much can I put in there?
*  I'd put about a teaspoon.
*  And stir it in.
*  But the neurogenesis, that's good. And the neurogenesis,
*  this company in France that we did the neurogenic test with, found that the mycelium was far more
*  active than the mushroom fruit bodies. And so the Lion's Mane stimulates
*  neurite outgrowth and basically extends the nerves from growing compared to baseline.
*  So in seven to 12 days, a substantial up to 22% increase in neurite outgrowth.
*  What we found was actually, there was one that was at 8%, one was at 12%. And then
*  then separately, we stocked it with an analog of psilocybin. And rather than that being the
*  arithmetic additive of cumulative, we found the synergy. So we think that Lion's Mane,
*  the research has shown, increases myelin regeneration on the sheath of the nerves.
*  And the psilocybin proliferates nerve tip growth.
*  So it should conceivably help you learn.
*  So this is an example. This is unexpected result. This is Lion's Mane mycelium.
*  That's showing a 14, you know, basically a 14.8% over baseline. Then we have a psilocybin analog
*  that didn't do all that great. Which analog is this again?
*  This is a, I'm going to describe the analog for now. Okay.
*  For obvious reasons, but it's a legal analog. It creates a 7% outgrowth of neurites.
*  But then we stacked it with Lion's Mane and the psilocybin analog, there's a theoretical additive
*  effect. 114 plus 107, 122. But we got 136. Statistically significant. The outlier actually
*  is even higher. So the neuroscientists in France that did this study was extremely excited.
*  And we found that the more we titrated it to greater dilution, the more active it becomes.
*  What's that mean? Well, titrate, what does that mean?
*  We're diluting it. And it is our human cells, pluripotent stem cells. And what we found was,
*  originally we were told it's called three micrograms per milligram, or three micrograms,
*  a millionth of a gram. But when we went back to 0.03, 100 times less, the neurogenic benefits
*  became greater. Now there's something called the PK conversion, the pharmacokinetics, when you
*  ingest something, only a small portion of it may make it into your bloodstream. But the good news
*  is that these things are so nontoxic, and they're so potent. Now, looking at the dosing regimen,
*  it appears so far, we haven't done this clinically, this is human cells in vitro,
*  but this laboratory is predictive of neurogenic compounds that these, the neurogenic benefits are
*  so substantial that the PK conversion of ingesting them can be seen in the bloodstream as a fairly
*  good conversion rate. So you, for instance, if you take vanilla acid, vanilla, about 2% will make it
*  into your bloodstream. So if you take one whole gram of vanilla, only 2% actually gets into your
*  bloodstream. So that's the PK conversion. So what we're seeing is, right now, is the potency of this
*  is so strong at lower and lower dilutions, we're getting more and more potency. So I'm, this is,
*  yeah, it's a, I like to say dilution is a solution to profitability. The more that we dilute, the more
*  potent it becomes. So this is why the neuroscientists in France are doing the study going, this stuff is
*  so potent, please dilute it, dilute it, dilute it. So, and so we're, we see this as a tremendous horizon
*  that Lyons mains legal. It's an edible and choice mushroom, thousand year history of use.
*  We found that the mycelium is far more potent than the mushrooms for really good reasons.
*  The, the, some of the compounds are called aranasins, and these are actually discovered
*  by Kawagishi in 1994, looking for an antibacterial agent. And so when they, when he was looking at
*  the mycelium, fighting bacteria, he found that the mycelium expressed this antibacterial
*  cyanothan derivative, and he gave it the name aranasin after hericium aranasius, just like
*  penicillin is named after penicillium. And so he'd stumbled on the fact that it has neurogenic
*  properties and antibacterial properties. So the mycelium is navigating through the ground,
*  through a hostile environment. It's only one cell wall thick. It, the mycelium has an immune system
*  that's operational between like 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 degrees Fahrenheit, you know,
*  35 degrees Celsius. That's, that's, that's the window it's growing in. So it's immune systems
*  operative in that window. When you do super hot water extracts, you're in the extreme zone.
*  That's not part of the immunological lifespan of the mushroom. You're decocting it. You're taking
*  out ingredients, but you're not harnessing within the immunological window of temperatures that the
*  mycelium has evolved to fight off pathogens. And so what we have found is the mycelium is far more
*  active than the fruit bodies. This is all new science, but then mushroomreferences.com is
*  populated with dozens upon dozens of peer-reviewed articles showing the mycelium as far more active
*  than the fruit bodies. And a whole genome sequencing of reishi, for instance, found 25
*  more, 25% more genes coding for proteins are expressed at the mycelial state than at the
*  mushroom state. Well, that makes sense because the mushrooms at the end of millions of cell divisions
*  over months, years, even decades, finally produce a mushroom that rots in five days. The mushroom
*  doesn't need a good immune system, is attracting mycovores, animals, deer. You know, John just
*  showed me some photographs of, he's going to show you, he was in a campground and found deer
*  in the morning digging up mushrooms out of the ground. Well, animals engage mushrooms.
*  John who?
*  Your colleagues here. Or maybe it's Jeff. I'm sorry.
*  Jeff, one of the guys who works here?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So the idea, but mushrooms attract insects, people, animals, because they're fragrant,
*  they're protein, they're nutritionally dense, and they want to engage humans. The mycelium
*  is navigating through a microbial hostile environment. And a report came out in the
*  literature of over a thousand species of bacteria in a single gram. There's more than eight miles of
*  mycelium in a single cubic inch. So the mycelium is navigating through a hostile microbial
*  environment. It's setting up guilds and microbiomes and collections of cooperating
*  bacteria that can help them defend against pathogens.
*  Look at that. Estimated up to eight miles of mycelium in a single inch of soil.
*  And it's only one cell wall thick.
*  That's such a weird looking image. So it's so hard to see what that is.
*  That's a mushroom that's melted back into the ground. This mycelium that's just now the
*  mushrooms generate mycelium and it goes underneath the ground. So every time you're walking on the
*  ground, you're walking upon miles upon miles of mycelium and it knows that you're there.
*  These are sensitive. These are not only externalized stomachs
*  that are digesting nutrients and externalized lungs exhaling carbon oxide, inhaling oxygen.
*  But I believe these are extant neurological networks of nature. When you see that pervasiveness
*  of those cells and the climate change scientists are coming around to this, 70% of the carbon
*  biologically stored in mycelium in the ground. The way to fight climate change is not only
*  replanting trees, which is great. I love it. But it's the mycelial networks you're building
*  the humus that creates the soil that creates the biodiversity that then guarantees the health of
*  the ecosystem. So it's the mycelial networks that govern because they're so pervasive. They set up
*  because they're antibacterial properties, they're probacterial properties.
*  Another example of this is in the microbiome of soils and inside of humans' stomachs.
*  Turkey tail mushrooms and a placebo controlled randomized clinical study with humans
*  from some scientists associated with Harvard found that turkey tail mycelium is a prebiotic
*  for the microbiome that feeds bifidobacterium lactobacillus and suppresses clostridium,
*  which is an inflammatory bacterium. So it's really, really interesting that the mycelium
*  is feeding nutrients to the beneficial bacteria within the microbiome that then gives us health.
*  And so these are precursor nutrients that elevate the populations of the beneficial bacteria. So
*  the two go hand in hand. What about edible mushrooms, things like shiitake and those
*  types of mushrooms? Is there any nutritional benefit to those things? Enormous nutritional
*  benefit. And there's been two also meta studies that have come out this year showing that the
*  ingestion of mushrooms with elderly people over the age of 60, there's a 50%
*  decreased odds of Alzheimer's like symptoms with a population of people consuming three
*  mushroom meals per week. Now they didn't specify the mushrooms as a single pore,
*  but the mushrooms they're commonly eating are oyster mushrooms, shiitake and shimeji,
*  and maybe some other mushrooms. But that's one meta study that came out. There was a study
*  out of Japan from Dr. Ikikawa at the National Cancer Center that found statistically significant
*  reduction in cancers across the board. I think 162,000 people in this data set. And he was sent
*  over to the Nagano prefecture to look for this. And these are edible and delicious mushrooms.
*  Also they empower the immune system. Again, signal from the noise, statistically significant
*  reduction in overall cancer rates associated with a food. The division now between foods and
*  medicines is blurred. And yet it speaks to Hippocrates and Dioscorides stating that,
*  let food be thy medicine, medicine be thy food. So it's interesting because physicians have been
*  taught this sort of monomolecular approach to medicine. And now we're realizing that these
*  foods are essential nutrients for your immune system that downgrade laced inflammation.
*  Pete Slauson It's so interesting that we're learning all this during our lifetime too.
*  Do you think that would all be established by now?
*  Dr. David Smoot Well, I'm glad you asked that. We have a paper coming out in the next
*  two or three days, maybe in the next week. And it's on turkey tail mycelium,
*  they're grown on rice. And we were able to find out something that no one had reported in the
*  literature. The traditional Chinese medicine approach is that these are immunomodulators.
*  They help the immune system, but they also are not inflammatory. When you have an immune response,
*  oftentimes associated with an inflammatory response, blood rushes to the wound, you inflame,
*  you have all these compounds that are being produced by the blood to suppress an infection.
*  But you can overamp the immune system and have a pro-inflammatory response that can cause a lot of
*  oxidative stress damage, collaterally. And so, the article that's just coming out with BMC,
*  Biomed Central, alternative and complementary medicine, peer reviewed, we have found that
*  the mycelium when it grows on rice, bio-ferments the rice to then produce a unique immunological
*  response that upregulates what's called interleukin 1RA and interleukin 10. These are anti-inflammatory
*  cytokines. And so, the mycelium doesn't do that, the mushrooms don't do that, but the mycelium is
*  bio-fermented, the rice, like tempeh is transformed, or like yogurt comes from milk because of
*  lactobacillus or acidophilus, and that transformation then makes a novel product. We
*  have found the same thing. The rice compared to the rice control has no anti-inflammatory properties.
*  The mycelium, because of the extracellular metabolites, changes the rice into a unique
*  immunological product that excites the expression of anti-inflammatory compounds while also
*  exciting the pro-immune response. So, it's a buffered response.
*  It's interesting too that you're bringing this up that it's growing on something else.
*  That seems to be part of nature, right? This sort of symbiotic relationship that some of these
*  mushrooms have with the plants and the environment around them.
*  That's a really, really good point because the mycelium, when we found with the bees,
*  when we grew the mycelium on rice compared to on birch wood, the mycelium grown on rice reduced the
*  viruses 10 to 1. The mycelium we grew on birch reduced the viruses up to 1,000 to 1.
*  Oh, so that's just natural environment.
*  That speaks to the fact that there appears to be something that's coding within the ecosystem
*  that then excites the mycelium to produce something that is more strongly
*  result in an antiviral activity.
*  That's the case with cordyceps as well, right? Cordyceps mushrooms grow on other things.
*  Yeah, but the cordyceps mushrooms, when they grow on the worms, this is something that was a big
*  subject of debate because cordyceps sinensis is a mushroom that grows on a worm, basically.
*  Like a little caterpillar.
*  On a caterpillar larvae in the Himalayas, elsewhere in China and the Far East.
*  People were finding these cordyceps mushrooms and they were cloning them.
*  Then they got the culture going and then they analyzed the culture and they got what's called
*  an anamorph. It's not that complicated. It's just two faces of the same coin.
*  There's a mushroom fruit body and then there's this imperfect form that is a different looking
*  organism but they're actually the same. They have two different expressions.
*  All the scientific literature kept on coming up with different anamorphs.
*  So they all had all this competition in the scientific literature. What is a true anamorph
*  of cordyceps sinensis? Well, now it's called aphiocordyceps sinensis. They redefined it.
*  It's called sensu stricto. When they analyzed the mushrooms, not until recently, they discovered
*  that another group of fungi are chasing the cordyceps sinensis. As the fruit body develops,
*  other fungi are chasing right behind the other fungus. So you have multiple fungi that are
*  actually present in the cordyceps worm. It's not just one species. It's multiple species that are
*  co-occurring, chasing each other inside the cordyceps mushroom as its fruits.
*  So again, it just speaks to the complexity of nature.
*  So where should you get your cordyceps source for health benefits?
*  That's a really good question. Cordyceps militaris does not have these issues that
*  cordyceps sinensis does. The problem is cordyceps sinensis, thousands of articles have been
*  published. Really, which one they're talking about is like it's all mixed up now. What is
*  true anamorph for these scientists using? There are ones called Bacilliomyces. There are other
*  ones that Hercitella sinensis is now thought to be the true anamorph for cordyceps sinensis.
*  All this lingo means is basically there's a mushroom with a whole bunch of other fungi that
*  are associated with it. And when they cultured these other fungi, they did clinical studies or
*  research studies, and they came up with results. The problem is that they've mixed it up into four
*  or five different species, and you can't sort of disambiguate the data now because it's too
*  complicated. So it's a really good question. The cordyceps militaris does not have these issues.
*  And so I would steer people to cordyceps militaris right now because the cordyceps sinensis,
*  the aphiocordyceps sinensis issues are still complicated. And now virtually thousands of
*  research articles are all now suspect because no one has a foggiest idea what anamorph they were
*  using. So it speaks to the complexity of the system. And how many people are actually working
*  on this data too? Oh, thousands of researchers. And I'm thankful that the Chinese mycologists
*  were the ones who finally sorted this out. There was a lot of conflict academically. There's a lot
*  of big egos in academia. People get wedded to their own research. We're all like that. And
*  the challenges went back and forth. And fortunately, a group of Chinese scientists finally
*  were able to narrow down the argument to understand that everyone was actually doing good culture work.
*  They were actually expert mycologists taking the right tissue, taking it from the right cordyceps
*  mushroom. It's just that at that time, they had a different fungus that was naturally part of the
*  inside of the mushroom. That was a mixture of fungi that were racing at different paces up the
*  mushroom. Well, the Chinese were the first to use it for a performance benefit, right? Or they were
*  the first to at least be publicized to use it in the Olympics. They were using cordyceps mushrooms.
*  That was one of the reasons why on it we developed ShroomTech Sport, which is a cordyceps mushroom
*  based supplement, which I love cordyceps for workouts, for pre-workout. It's like it gives
*  you an extra gear. It's really kind of crazy how effective it is, especially in combination with B12
*  and other adaptogens. It's a great pre-workout supplement because it doesn't get you jittery at
*  all. It's not a stimulant, but you have like a little more juice when you exercise. And that's
*  one of the things that those high altitude hurting populations have found, right?
*  That's exactly right. It's likely to be a vasodilator and it has sterotal like benefits as well.
*  So yeah, the cordyceps for athletes has been tried and true and many of these anamorphs that
*  I mentioned have those properties. So for athletes, like what dose would you recommend?
*  Like if you're going to exercise? Well, I'm not a medical doctor, so when people ask me
*  recommendations, I know that the common usage of these in the order of two grams, you know,
*  there are usually 500 milligram capsules. There's lots of good companies that are producing this,
*  I would just make sure it's mycelial based, it's not fruit body based. The clear evidence is showing
*  the problem. How would one find out whether something's mycelial based? We say mushroom
*  mycelium on all of our labels. And if you were going to take that, like if you wanted to take
*  Shroom Tech Sport, if you wanted to make your own concoction, you would recommend two grams and then?
*  And make sure you know the chain of custody of where it came from, because a lot of these
*  companies buy on the spot market. What company is this that you gave me? Host Defense. Is this yours?
*  Is this your company? Oh, okay. We'll support you. Host Defense and there's their website where
*  someone can grab this? Yeah, funjay.com or hostdefense.com. And do you sell cordyceps as well?
*  Yes, we do. Oh, there you go. And do you take this stuff before you exercise? Do you take cordyceps?
*  Yeah, I take cordyceps. I take Lion's Mane and Seven Species Blend in particular.
*  Seven Species Blend. What's in that stuff? It's Stamut 7. It's got Chaga. It's got Reishi.
*  It has a Garakon. It's got a birch polypore called pitoporus betulinus. And so it has mitocci in it.
*  And these are the Seven Species Blend. But the evidence for physicians and people who want to
*  look at peer-reviewed articles, the single species have the most elaborated and convincing
*  evidence when you start compounding these. So what we're doing, we have five or six full-time
*  researchers, several PhDs in our staff. We are, again, trying to disambiguate the complexity of
*  all these benefits by looking at one species at a time. So we're doing this methodically, spending
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars, literally a year now. I have 110 employees, and I created
*  my company in order to do research. I have no partners. So I can now dedicate the resources
*  to be able to do novel research. And we love going up against conventional wisdom, because you have
*  to challenge conventional wisdom to see if it indeed meets the muster. For instance, beta-glucans.
*  How big is a beta-glucan? 10,000 Daltons? A million Daltons?
*  I have no idea what any of those words you just said were.
*  No, beta-glucans are big polymers of sugars.
*  Okay.
*  And so the big myth out there is beta-glucans are the golden compound that used to standardize
*  products to. But there is not a certified method for beta-glucan analysis. We have an article
*  coming out also on a 17-species blend using the same, it's called the Megazine test, the same
*  Megazine test with one, with going to the same exact test, two, the same samples, one sample got
*  less than 1%, and the other sample got more than 30%. That is a disparate range of data that does
*  not give you any confidence. And so the beta-glucan method, how big is the beta-glucans? Well, the
*  beta-glucans are a giant scaffolding. It's like the structure of this building. And inside
*  that scaffolding is all these other compounds that are adornments that are embedded in this
*  giant scaffolding. And so we did a clinical study with turkey tail mushrooms and breast cancer that
*  was published in a peer-reviewed journal. And the scientists that I worked with, Ken Quail at OWL,
*  I think in 2016, I think published an article where they use lipases, which is an enzyme that
*  dissolves lipids. Because I was arguing the beta-glucans are a huge scaffolding. There's
*  other components inside the beta-glucans that are immunologically active, you know? And they
*  had been reading the literature. It's all predominantly beta-glucans. I said, well,
*  let's do an experiment. And they did. They took the ball and ran with it. And then they put this
*  fat-dissolving enzyme, lipases, and they strip the lipids, the fats, from the beta-glucans
*  scaffolding. And then they took that product without the lipids and it reduced immune response
*  by 83 percent, thus proving that the lipids that were inside the beta-glucans were pharmacologically
*  active. Now, the why that's important is if you do hot water extracts, you don't get fats.
*  You know, fats is not miscible in water. And so that's why fat separates. So having these
*  fats, and we're made of fat, cholesterol is good for you. Fats are good for you.
*  Wait, what are you saying?
*  You're a paleo guy, right? So you know this, you know, from the fats or...
*  Yeah, I don't like that word, paleo, because I think it's a little
*  inaccurate, like what people ate during the Paleolithic.
*  I like calling it primordial.
*  Yeah, that's a good one. Primal, you know, some people call it the primal diet.
*  Yeah.
*  But this just speaks to the fact that every mushroom species is like a miniature pharmaceutical
*  factory. And what makes a species is the accumulation of those compounds that are
*  different mixtures. There's around 1.5 million species of fungi, 150,000 species are mushroom
*  forming fungi. We've identified around 15,000 species. Of those 15,000 species, we have about
*  20 to 40 species that we know are beneficial for human health. Well, that's a pretty good
*  selection criteria. Going from 14,000 identified species or potentially 150,000 out there,
*  we haven't identified most of them. But our ancestors, through trial and error,
*  have narrowed the field of candidates down to about 20 to 40 species that we know because of
*  their molecular arrangements and complexity, benefit human health.
*  When people pick mushrooms, when they go out and pick mushrooms, the real issue seems to be
*  that there's some mushrooms that are edible that look very close to mushrooms, very similar to
*  mushrooms that are very poisonous. True to the uninitiated and the people who have not learned.
*  But once you learn the chanterelle, you will not mistake it. Nothing looks like a lion's mane
*  mushroom. Once you learn lion's mane mushroom, it's hard to mistake it. So there are some lookalikes.
*  And with Ammonida phalloides, the destroying angel, and with the patty straw mushroom,
*  which is commonly cultivated and collected in Asia, many of the mushroom deaths in North America
*  have come from not displaced peoples, but people who've come from Asia. And because they're secretive
*  in the language barrier and the culture of being wild collectors, they then mistake the
*  destroying angel for a patty straw mushroom. That's a real common mistake. There are other
*  people who said they, well, it just looked edible. That's a really dangerous thing to say.
*  You have to know species individually. There's edible species of Ammonida, and there's poisonous
*  ones. There's deadly poisonous ones. Ammonida seems to have a lot of controversy as far as its
*  efficacy, as far as its psychedelic efficacy. What's that? I don't know anybody that's ever
*  really tripped off of it. Miscaria or Ammonida? Yeah. Oh man, do I have a story? Please. Oh my
*  God. Because everybody that I know, and that was something that McKenna talked about as well,
*  Terrence talked about while he was alive. He said that it seems that it's genetically variable,
*  seasonally variable, perhaps even environmentally variable. All those things are partially true.
*  I've eaten the Ammonida Miscaria four or five times. The Ammonida Miscaria is the red mushroom
*  with the white dots, is the fairytale mushroom. It's perfectly legal, Santa Claus mushroom.
*  It contains muscimol, muscarin, and ebutinic acid. Actually very small amounts of muscarin,
*  but the muscarinic symptoms cause salivation and sweating. I tripped with my friend on Ammonida
*  Miscaria, and I looked at him and he was foaming at the mouth. He had all these bubbles coming out
*  of his mouth. I go, man, dude, you look like you have rabies. He goes, you should see what you look
*  like. But then Ammonida Miscaria, I've eaten that a few times and people do boil it in water, throw
*  away the water twice, and they can make it into an edible mushroom, but it's not that great of an
*  edible. But there's another mushroom called Ammonida pantherina. Now pantherina is a kick-ass mushroom.
*  It has five times or more the amounts of muscimol and ebutinic acid, almost no muscarin.
*  So the salivation effect of Ammonida Miscaria. So I had a very good friend. We are not friends
*  anymore, unfortunately. But I was in charge of the herbarium at the Evergreen State College,
*  and I freeshride Ammonida pantherina. They're called panthercaps. They're brown in color,
*  and they have dots. Very good. The panthercaps, perfectly legal mushroom and extraordinarily
*  powerful. So I was living up in Darrington, Washington. I had this cabin. I was a logger
*  hippie for a few years. And so my friend Dave came up, and I had these freeshride mushrooms
*  from the herbarium. And I said, let's go ahead and eat these. And I had read in the literature,
*  and almost no one had eaten them. So we made an omelet, and we cooked it up. And he was much
*  lighter than me, so I thought, well, I should have two-thirds of the omelet, right? Because
*  he's lighter than me. And so we ate the mushrooms around 10 o'clock. And we're living in this cabin,
*  but across the creek was the Squire Creek Campground. And it was what we call the
*  Winnebago people, right? Back then in the 70s, I hitchhiked across country 13 times. Winnebago
*  never picked me up. So they were always the enemy. And so we were long-haired hippies. We ate these
*  mushrooms, and we thought for entertainment, let's go look at the Winnebago people. So we,
*  it was so close. I don't know why we drove our car, but we drove the car out of my cabin. We
*  went down like a half a mile, and we turned left into the Squire Creek Campground. And we parked
*  the car, and we wanted to go up to a beautiful view spot. And so we walked through the Winnebago
*  people and their families and everything else. And we get up onto a ridge. And we thought,
*  this is a great view spot. But we're waiting like an hour, no effect. And I was talking to Dave,
*  I said, wow, maybe these aren't that potent. And then right after we said that,
*  I looked at Dave and I said, David, do you see that? He goes, yeah. And we waited a few more
*  seconds, and it was this big distortion field. And we had a beautiful view of the volcanoes and the
*  valleys, a big view scape, but we could see the air where it had become sort of this liquid.
*  And then it started coming on stronger and stronger and stronger. And we go, oh my God,
*  this is getting intense. We better get the heck out of here and go home where it's safe,
*  because this is coming on so strong. So we come down off this little plateau, and we had to come
*  down through the Winnebago people. And then oh my God, and here we're walking. Now the thing about
*  Amanitas and Muscaria pantherina, you have dull yellows and browns, but you feel like this giant,
*  and you're moving in slow motion. Every step you're taking, you know, you feel like this giant,
*  but moving really slow. And then I came to Winnebago's of no end. They were hundreds of
*  feet long. I'm trying to walk past this Winnebago, like when is this Winnebago going to end? I keep
*  on walking further and further. And then oh my God, and so then we're really just really,
*  really high. It was ridiculous. I had a Rolly Flex camera, and we came up to the car. And so for some
*  frigging reason, I locked the car. And so I had my key. I looked at my key and I look at the lock. I
*  went, missed. Oh shit. Okay. Pull the key back. Missed. But Dave goes, you okay? I go, I'm fine.
*  He goes, do you want me to drive? And I go, no way, dude. If I'm this high, there's no way I want
*  you to drive, right? And so I did it over and over again, then magically just for repetition,
*  it just made it into the lock. So I unlocked the door and I get into the car and I dropped my camera.
*  And then I'm in the car and I'm trying to get my key in. Thank God I didn't get my key in. I was
*  not safe to drive. And then Dave is going like, oh my God, Paul, we're so frigging high right now.
*  And I go, and I said, well, let's go home. I said, did I drop my camera? And I went over and I looked
*  on the ground. There's my camera. I picked it up and going, wow, Dave, I dropped my camera.
*  Dropped my camera again. I go, wow, Dave, did I drop my camera? Picked up my camera and go,
*  whoa, I dropped my camera. I did this over and over and over again. Repetitive motion syndrome
*  kicked in. It's a very common symptom of amyterpiantherina. I dropped my camera
*  dozens and dozens of times. How did it look at the end? Well, it was shattered. But Dave goes,
*  Paul, you should look up. And a whole bunch of people from the Winnebago community had lined up
*  holding their children in close proximity, watching this repetitive motion syndrome
*  where I'm just constantly picking my camera. So they're watching you for entertainment where
*  you went to watch them for entertainment. And now they're freaking out because I have this
*  repetitive motion syndrome and I take one step, I drop my camera. Wow, Dave, I dropped my camera.
*  And I pick up my camera again. I go, did I just drop my camera? Whoa, I dropped my camera again.
*  Now this speaks to the berserkers. And the berserkers, the word berserk came from the
*  berserkers in Scandinavia where the legend has it that there were these Scandinavians,
*  the Vikings were surrounded and outnumbered and they were going to be killed the next day.
*  And they ate a whole bunch of amdium ischaria and a big soup. And legend has it, and it's not been
*  confirmed, but this is the legend that's very commonly reiterated, is that they drank a whole
*  bunch of amdium ischaria soup. And then they went and the next day, even though they're massively
*  outnumbered, they took off all their clothes and they attacked the enemy naked with swords.
*  And that's where the word berserk came from, the berserkers. So I'm having this berserker experience
*  of repetitive motion syndrome. And I'm dropping my camera over and over and over again. And I
*  looked up and these parents were holding their children, they were totally freaking out. I said,
*  we got to get out of here. So we left the doors open in the car and I'm taking one or two steps,
*  dropping my camera, picking it up, dropping my camera. We finally made it back. He disappeared.
*  I didn't know. So Dave, you're on your own. I have enough to worry about.
*  I made it back to my cabin and I get to my cabin and there's a combination lock. Oh, no,
*  I don't need a combination lock right now. I can barely, I'm spinning lock back and forth,
*  spinning back and forth. And then eventually the lock just spontaneously opened and then I fell on
*  the ground and I started convulsing. And the cool thing about convulsing was it felt good.
*  Every time I convulsed, I actually went, oh, that feels so good. So I convulsed some more.
*  And I was just convulsing constantly.
*  Like epileptic convulsions?
*  Epileptic convulsions. Very, very intense, but they felt good. This is the weird thing about it.
*  I needed to convulse because every time I convulsed, I kind of got a reset of my neurology,
*  you know, and I went baseline and then I would spin out of control. And then I had this cascade
*  of Istenian thoughts. I'm going, oh my God, I can save the world. I know how to do this. And
*  then I would have a prepositional or an unverbial phrase. And just before I came to the object
*  of my thought that was Einsteinian insight, I would have a tangent. And then I would come to
*  the course at the end of that sentence and then I have another tangent. I saw death as a perpetual
*  series of alternatives that never gave me the satisfaction of a conclusive thought.
*  And so I was just lasting for about 12 hours. You know, I fainted. I went into a coma-like state.
*  So you recommend it?
*  I do not recommend it. And the biggest concern beside the repetitive motion syndrome is
*  hypothermia. Because if you're out in the woods or something and you're exposed, you're not getting
*  up. So you go and it's called soma for a reason. It's the soma mushroom. It is somniferous. It
*  causes sleep.
*  Is that what soma is? Because isn't there some debate as to what soma actually is?
*  That's what R. Gordon-Watson proposed soma in the Vedic literature. There's a big debate about that.
*  The other story I like to tell is my friend Dr. Andrew Weil was at the Cougar Hot Springs in
*  Oregon. And Andy is a medical doctor from Harvard. And he was walking the trail and people came
*  running down and said, oh my God, this guy's trying to kill himself. You've got to come up.
*  And Andy went up and this guy had eaten a whole bunch of Andean muscaria.
*  Big biker dude. And he was covered with blood. And he was up on a bridge. And he was swinging
*  his legs back and forth. And he was above the rocks and he threw himself off the bridge.
*  Now it's only about six or eight feet, but it's enough on the boulders down below.
*  Smash himself on the rocks. And then he climbed back up on the bridge.
*  And he swung his feet and threw himself off the bridge. So this causes repetitive motion syndrome.
*  Both of my camera, et cetera. It's a mushroom that's perfectly legal. It's probably one of the most
*  dangerous mushrooms that anyone could eat. I definitely advise not doing this because
*  I always thought if I was ever called as an expert witness having these experiences
*  and someone who was watching Tales from the Crypt on TV and then they saw a knife,
*  it causes temporary insanity. I mean, the silicide mushrooms are wonderful. They're peaceful.
*  They're loving. It's an empathico, right? But the aminida mushrooms cause this strange,
*  strange sort of behavior that is really potentially dangerous.
*  And that is the mushroom that was documented in the sacred mushroom in the cross where John
*  Marco Allegro alleged that the entire Christian religion was essentially a misunderstanding.
*  And it was really all about the consumption of these psychedelic mushrooms and fertility
*  rituals and that these were all sort of captured in stories and tales and parables.
*  Yeah, it was academic suicide for him to come out with that statement and still very controversial.
*  Have you read his work?
*  Yes, I have.
*  What do you think?
*  Well, linguistically, the guy's way over my head. If you read his book, it's all about linguistics
*  and the translators of the Dead Sea Scrolls, way beyond my ken of knowledge. It's so far beyond
*  my ken of knowledge, I can't make rhyme or reason out of it.
*  That seems to be the problem with it. Most people can't.
*  But there's threads of truth in all of this, but I don't buy it on its face,
*  on the grandiose conclusions that he made. But clearly, mushrooms have inspired religion.
*  And I teach these workshops on gourmet and medicinal mushrooms. And one of these workshops
*  is a very spiritual guy. He's very quiet, but very definitely, you know,
*  walked us. It looked like the real deal. He waited until everyone was gone. And he said,
*  Paul, I've been sent here. And I said, really? And he says, I'm a devout Christian.
*  I'm in Billy Graham's inner circle. And a bunch of us take suicide mushrooms as sacraments.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  And it's brought us closer to Jesus, closer to our religion. Now, I don't care if you're Muslim
*  or Christian or Hindu, the idea of these mushrooms making you feel the spiritual universe, more
*  spiritually connected, giving you a cultural heritage and your reference points. But he said,
*  these are extremely important. Now, my mother was a charismatic Christian. I met some people in her
*  group who came to their religious beliefs through psychedelics. Don't do psychedelics now.
*  But that was their portal. They had their big revelation through psychedelics. So the connection
*  between psilocybin and magic mushrooms and religion, I think, has a lot of credibility.
*  And there's lots of great examples of that. The specificity of some of the arguments people make,
*  I have great doubts about.
*  That's interesting. What about in the ancient Hindu religions? The ancient Hinduism and some
*  of the ancient books speak of various sacraments that have sort of never been defined, right?
*  Yeah. And why is the Brahmin cows sacred? You know, when the psilocybe kubensis grows out of cow poop
*  in India, and yet they won't eat cows. And Buddha supposedly died from a mushroom.
*  He was given a mushroom by a peasant and ingested the mushroom and died.
*  So there is that connection. I've always thought it curious that psilocybe kubensis is such a
*  religious provoking mushroom, and yet cows are highly revered as being sacred. Well,
*  I would think you would keep the mother of the mushroom sacred. You know, you want to protect
*  the resource. But again, these are at times when fables and parables and religious rights were
*  controlled by the cognizante, and they were the gatekeepers of knowledge that was too powerful for
*  the general population to understand or appreciate. And so they protected that knowledge.
*  That's the rule of most religions, is that the inner circle holds the keys to the kingdom.
*  And what's happened with orthodox religions is they create institutions
*  where you have to pay tithings in order to have a gatekeeper just to have a contact with God.
*  And that, I think, is the problem of monotheism versus polytheism.
*  Pete Slauson Jack Herrera, before he died, was working on
*  a book about psychedelic drugs, specifically mushrooms, and religious experiences. And he had
*  some really crazy old paintings that he had found that showed people that were naked, seemingly
*  dancing in ecstasy with a translucent mushroom around them. And the idea being that this is
*  supposed to, this image was supposed to represent someone who was tripping.
*  Pete Slauson There's a lot of really interesting books
*  that have been published that show art, you know, going back hundreds of years, even, you know,
*  into the late 1300s showing, you know, Christian art where mushrooms are pretty easily seen.
*  So, there's a lot of history to that. But it becomes the unfathomable. I mean,
*  maybe you can imagine it to be true, but how can you prove it to be true?
*  Pete Slauson Right. How can you?
*  Pete Slauson So, a lot of that is like, it's great historical
*  information. Probably a lot of it's true. Hard to say which is true and which is not.
*  Pete Slauson But it seems reasonable, right?
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, but in modern times now, Johns Hopkins,
*  these clinical studies are on mysticism, spirituality, showing that these are some
*  of the most spiritually significant experiences of people's lives. The interesting thing about
*  Johns Hopkins studies is that 70% of the people had positive experiences. And 14 months later,
*  they still described these experiences as being significantly positive. Their friends, their
*  colleagues, their fellow workers also say that it materially changed these people's personality.
*  But the 30% of people who had negative experiences, the negativity of the experience
*  did not extend more than the experience itself. So, this speaks to re-remembering. And what's been
*  determined is when you have these really profound spiritual experiences, it sits with you. And when
*  you re-remember it, you rekindle that thought. And this may be a way of overlaying PTSD. Rather
*  than having the reference standard that's associated with PTSD, you supplant it with a positive
*  experience. But the people who had negative experiences during tripping did not have a
*  negative, that negative consequences did not extend more than the experience itself. So,
*  this was a profound insight. And so, Johns Hopkins, Roland Griffiths just emailed me recently,
*  they have other clinical studies that are ongoing, looking at one which has got published on
*  meditators, giving placebos versus getting high doses of psilocybin, and then measuring
*  the consequences of those experiences months or a year or two later. And again, the same thing is
*  reinforced. These psilocybin mushroom experiences create a positive reference point that you can
*  capitalize on by re-remembering them subsequent from this experience by not even having to take
*  the mushrooms again. That is profound. When you have a happy memory that you can anchor your
*  personality on, it's a game changer. Yeah. I just wonder if we're ever going to see in our lifetime
*  centers where you can go and a trained professional can guide you through something like this.
*  It's happening now. Is it? Yes. The California Institute of Integrative Studies,
*  and based in San Francisco, are those training therapists. In Canada, they're therapists. In
*  Europe, they're therapists. There's training programs now in psychedelic therapy. This is
*  something that has a tremendous momentum. Indigenous peoples have a really nice structure, many of them
*  do, not all, but many have a really good structure for the responsible use of these substances.
*  Us, they're displaced peoples. I would call us European-based people, and many other people
*  displaced. We don't have the same constructs historically that we can operate within.
*  The psychedelic therapist movement is huge right now. Canada is leading the way. The Canadian
*  government is very, very positive towards psychedelic therapy because of the opioid crisis
*  and because significant results. In the movie, this has come out called Dosed and it attracts
*  a heroin addict, a young lady in Vancouver. It is a heroic movie. It is not one of these,
*  you kind of feel good at the end of the movie, but it is intense. She's doing a boga,
*  and she also does high doses of mushrooms. But the opioid crisis is so pervasive, there's so
*  poor treatments available that through these psychedelic therapies and several days, they're
*  seeing a tremendous success and people breaking decades-long opioid addiction within a week.
*  So the psychedelic therapists are integral to that success. There are clinics now arising
*  all over the world for this. In Portugal, in Mexico, in Spain, in Jamaica,
*  there the clinics are arising specifically to meet the needs of people who are trying to get
*  these legally so they don't get in trouble with the law. So in Portugal, in Spain, in Jamaica,
*  for instance, these are legal. Many of these substances are.
*  Well, what gives me a lot of hope is that everything seems to be trending in a positive
*  direction. Like all these things that you're saying, your own personal experiences from TED
*  from 2008 versus 2019, all these different treatment patterns or pathways that are available
*  now to people that were never before and that we're starting to see an acceptance overall,
*  just the general population, people understand what this is and that this might literally be
*  the cure to what ails us. For people out there who have not gone on a deep psilocybin experience,
*  this is very important for me to emphasize. And after you do a heroic journey of psilocybin,
*  the next day when you look at those mushrooms, you say, no way, dude, I'm not touching those
*  for a long time. Give me six months, I'll come back to them. They're anti-addictive by their nature.
*  Because it's so powerful.
*  So powerful and profound and you've gone through the gauntlet and back. You're not ready to do it
*  again. And so how many drugs can have such a dramatic impact that are non-addictive,
*  that can break addictive cycles with other drugs? I think this is a gateway, a great gateway
*  opportunity for solving many of the ills of our society.
*  I couldn't agree more. Anything else before we get out of here?
*  No, I just want to thank you and your audience for having the courage to bring these subjects to the
*  table in a coherent fashion. We don't have all the answers. We will make mistakes. I think it's
*  really important that we take where the adults in the room, we see somebody spinning off the rails.
*  Rather than being judgmental, go up and put your arm around them, saying, hey, there's better
*  benefits from this. I fully understand why people want to party with them, especially when they're
*  younger and they're going the coming of age. But as you mature, these are really important
*  for your own sanity and for the health of your community and your family.
*  Cilicide mushrooms make nicer people.
*  I think that's a great way to say it. And I agree. And I think it should be on a t-shirt,
*  maybe a bumper sticker. And I want to thank you, man, without your knowledge and information and
*  the way you're able to so eloquently express all these ideas, a lot of people would know a whole
*  lot less. So thank you.
*  It's a team effort. It's just not me. It's a whole, it's an uprising. It's a mycelial underground
*  that's reaching up and telling people and sharing it with their friends. So check out the movie,
*  Fantastic Funjoy. It's really good. And DOST, two good movies that speak to this.
*  And your website once again?
*  Funjoy.com.
*  Funjoy.com. Paul Stamets, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Paul.
*  All right. Thank you, brother.
*  Bye.
