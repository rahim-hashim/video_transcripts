# Joe Rogan Experience #2125 - Kurt Metzger
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [March 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FPUuL2W2oI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's going on, buddy?
*  Good to see you.
*  It's fun to see you last night, too.
*  Wait, are we on yet?
*  Yes.
*  Oh, that's great that we opened up right on.
*  Right on you puffing?
*  Last night was fun.
*  Oh my god.
*  How funny was the towel, dude?
*  I remember today that he said that deliverance was his Barbie.
*  He said so many asides like that.
*  There were so many.
*  Tony said something really funny.
*  He said, you watch him, you die laughing.
*  And then afterwards you can't remember anything he said.
*  No, that's right.
*  And then I start to have recall.
*  It's like I got abducted and then the memories come back.
*  So when I woke up I was laughing because I remembered he said,
*  about he goes, I need to get a root canal, but I couldn't get it.
*  Guys, I couldn't get a root canal because I was in Oklahoma.
*  You know, every life is sacred.
*  You ever have a back alley root canal?
*  He was just everything about him was just so silly and so casual.
*  It was very, very.
*  And when he pulls out the recorder and starts playing that little flute thing.
*  Yeah, he learned to do that over the pandemic.
*  He learned to play recorder.
*  The fact that he uses a flip phone for real.
*  I guess he has.
*  You want some coffee?
*  Yeah, I guess he has a iPhone that he uses for social media.
*  When he, if I was, I was want to send him shit and I can't because he's a,
*  I guess he's taking the calls on the flip phone.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. He, he prefers to be out.
*  Does he work for a side?
*  I think he prefers to be with the flip phone, but I think he's right.
*  I think he's right.
*  I think he's right.
*  I think if you have a cell phone that's connected to the Internet, a smartphone,
*  but you don't use it that often every now and then you check it.
*  That's probably the way to go.
*  You know, of course he's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Everybody has North Korea in their pocket at all times.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah, you really do.
*  Our government, their government, everybody's government.
*  You better hope it's multiple governments so there's at least some competition for your data.
*  And it's not just one monopoly has all your data.
*  Right.
*  How much have you paid attention to the TikTok thing?
*  Whether trying to do this ban on TikTok too much because we covered it.
*  And it's because well, here's what it's besides controlling and being able to take shit down,
*  whatever they want and doing with China.
*  We are China, by the way.
*  I don't know if people think we're not China, but we are China.
*  And but now the real push was coming because of Israel, not because of, you know, the all the Hamas videos or whatever,
*  but Israelis post shit.
*  TikTok censors people.
*  TikTok's not like a free speech something platform.
*  So the shit Israeli soldiers are posting themselves is getting out.
*  And what happens is the kids are on TikTok and, you know, it hasn't been 1944 forever.
*  It's been pretty woke here.
*  So now that's clashing.
*  Seeing seeing this shit that, you know, remember Osama bin Laden made a huge comeback like about a I don't know how many months ago.
*  Oh, right, right.
*  People just discovered his letters.
*  God, he makes sense.
*  I think he's an industry plant there.
*  So what are these Israeli soldiers putting up on TikTok?
*  Well, all the war crimes that they do it.
*  No, look, I want to make this clear to everyone.
*  I would never listen to an Arab.
*  OK, so I want you to understand that I would never believe a Muslim about nothing.
*  You don't have to ever do that.
*  Look at not America.
*  What they tell you Israeli news, Israeli politicians, their ambassadors when they come here and talk, listen to what they say, because that's what I unfortunately did.
*  And it was quite disturbing.
*  And what's even more disturbing is when I tell my friends here in America, they go, yeah, no, it's war.
*  You're talking Hiroshima, right?
*  You've heard the old Nagasaki Hiroshima.
*  Yeah.
*  Kid Rock combo.
*  Yeah.
*  You'll get the dress.
*  OK, this is like how naive I am.
*  Jimmy was putting up because I could see the stories ready loading up for the whatever the next segment.
*  I see Israeli ambassador in UK, Dresden.
*  So what I think it's going to be is she's going, how dare you compare what we're doing to Dresden?
*  We're defending ourselves.
*  OK, that's what I think.
*  You know, what a normal human would do is go.
*  I would never want to say Dresden is OK.
*  You ever read Slaughterhouse?
*  Kurt Vonnegut?
*  We read the book in school because he was at Dresden, Kurt Vonnegut.
*  And it was a deliberate terror attack that we did with this is just established history.
*  It's a crime.
*  But, you know, we were fighting the Nazis, et cetera.
*  So and we won.
*  So, OK, that's how I thought we looked at it.
*  Like it was a terrible crime.
*  But she goes, yeah, you know, Dresden, we got to do Dresden.
*  Explain Dresden, what what took place at Dresden for people who might not know.
*  I don't remember what city it was.
*  We firebombed them.
*  Firebombed the entire city.
*  Yeah, indiscriminately.
*  No, no, no, not indiscriminately.
*  On purpose, targeted civilians to break their spirit.
*  But keep in mind, Dresden as much of it's a crime.
*  But that was like the wars going on and on.
*  So then they started doing shit like Dresden.
*  Evil shit.
*  We didn't do Hiroshima that week two of the war.
*  Right. Right.
*  Was Dresden.
*  Why was Dresden so heavily bombed?
*  This is all known.
*  Three day Allied bombing attack intended to force a German surrender, leveled the city and left tens of thousands dead.
*  And probably more than that, by the way.
*  Look, I thought everybody knew it was a war crime.
*  And actually, everybody did know up until like, you know, people thought natural immunity was a thing until a couple of years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  That's this is one of those.
*  So I'm disturbed by that.
*  So she was essentially saying we have to commit a war crime.
*  Right. We're doing a war cause in her brain, it's 1944 all day.
*  No, no.
*  From the cellar pointed out this mindset and it's very insightful because not 1948 when you got Israel established, it's 44 right after this shit happened and you're real mad.
*  They live in 19 for.
*  But we lived in wookie times.
*  So the clash between the cultures, every time I hear an Israeli official or military persons or fucking BB speak, it sounds like someone's embarrassing immigrant parent that doesn't know not to say gay slurs here in America.
*  Every time.
*  So, again, I do not support Hamas or any Arab or Muslim.
*  I hope I make it clear.
*  I'm one of the good people and like the good people I yearn for us to go back and fight them.
*  You remember back when that was already me when we knew what was what before we went to all this cuckoo caca.
*  I hope we go back to those days.
*  In fact, I was liberal.
*  I'd also hope that the Obama times that was so great.
*  Yeah, the times of a less or less confusing enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it was it was more clearly established what was going on.
*  This whole Dave Smith knows shit, by the way, when you have you probably had him recently.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  No, Dave's the best Dave knows.
*  I'm very proud of Dave consistently because he really knows his shit like he doesn't talk about things unless he knows his things and he goes very, very deep into subjects.
*  He doesn't talk out of his ass at all.
*  No, not at all, dude.
*  No, not at all.
*  Very, very deep into subjects really gets an understanding of them and fucking debates people and really knows what he's talking about.
*  Like he actually contributes to these conversations in a very, very meaningful way.
*  I know him a long time.
*  I'm very impressed with him right now.
*  He's very impressive.
*  He's very impressive.
*  He's the end.
*  He's hilarious, too.
*  It's like he's both things.
*  Hilarious comic.
*  Very impressive.
*  You see on Piers Morgan.
*  Yeah, I did see that.
*  So my buddy Gary from Erotic went on Piers Morgan with Kim or the other guy, the critical drinker, and then these two chicks from one was English and it was on Piers Morgan.
*  Piers Morgan is getting like the YouTube talent pool of whatever to come on and debate these stuff.
*  Like he discovered all this.
*  Right.
*  It's like are the Oscars over or are the Oscars irrelevant?
*  And I cannot wait to ask Gary about it when I because the question he like how come Barbie didn't win an Oscar was actually like a topic and like just said you mentioned like an international news show to figure out why Barbie is incredible.
*  Imagine being upset.
*  How come Oppenheimer got it?
*  Yeah.
*  Listen, even if it was like really good, it's a Barbie movie.
*  Right.
*  Batman Dark Knight.
*  Heath Ledger.
*  He's the reason that one just his performance.
*  Right.
*  Maybe maybe you can say that for Barbie.
*  It's pretty fucking good movie.
*  That's a different kind of movie, though.
*  That's a dystopian movie about a crime-ridden city.
*  Barbie.
*  Barbie's fun.
*  Oh, I thought you were talking about Barbie was crime-ridden.
*  Oh, is it good?
*  How could you compare the two movies?
*  Well, Oppenheimer is a movie that people will be watching decades from now.
*  I'll tell you how you check the algorithms and you see what topics are trending and you put them together like you're a fucking AI and you make a TV program out of that horse shit and you discuss it as if it's a thing.
*  Can you imagine you must be doing so well in life if like that's one of your your issues about like who got who got subbed at the Oscars at all?
*  I looked at it.
*  How did Barbie not get it?
*  You were just like, that's your big thought.
*  If you're just passionate about the Oscars, I think you're an idiot.
*  Right.
*  But if Barbie got it, I did.
*  Are you going to be this?
*  No, it was on until I saw John Cena naked on the Internet.
*  I didn't even know it wasn't a movie called Barbenheimer.
*  I didn't know they mashed those together to save the theater industry that got killed after covid and also all the movies sucking the theater industry did get killed, though.
*  Everybody knows they can stream things at home now.
*  So they just start giving it to you at home and then they don't have to pay as much.
*  Yeah. A lot of great reasons to stay home forever.
*  God, I don't know if you know, some piling up.
*  Oh, boy. Don't even go out no more, man.
*  But the covid really did in the streaming thing.
*  It did in all the things.
*  Well, it really did in rather the theater thing because streaming movies at home is so much if you've got a nice TV and boy, you can get a big ass TV cheap now.
*  Like what's a 65 inch Samsung TV cost right now?
*  When I remember when they first came out with plasma screens, you get cheaper than insulin.
*  I'll tell you like a 24 or 28 inch plasma screen.
*  And it was like twenty thousand dollars, twenty thousand dollars for a TV.
*  That's crazy.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah. Now a TV like that is free.
*  They just give you technically as low as four hundred dollars.
*  What?
*  But I mean, that's the oh my God, that's insane.
*  But yeah, whatever.
*  Sure. That's what I'm saying.
*  It's still 4K.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, you know what?
*  Let me see what that looks like for four three hundred and ninety seven dollars from Wal-Mart TV.
*  Best Buy. It's three ninety nine.
*  You sound like you're doing an ad for them.
*  No, but that's insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Sixty five inches, four K.
*  Look how thin it is.
*  Four hundred bucks.
*  Those fucking things were so expensive at one point in time.
*  So now watching movies at home is awesome.
*  Do you buy any like I always thought and I'm not smart with money in any way, but like top of the line technology such as that, like when twenty thousand dollars when it first comes out, never in my life.
*  Even if I would have the disposable income for a twenty thousand dollars, I go, of course, another thing's coming out tomorrow.
*  And this was going to that's how it's always been for this stuff.
*  But it wasn't when those twenty thousand dollar TVs came out.
*  It was a long time before anything was that's like, oh, well, it is when they first got the technology from Roswell.
*  So it's this is I think we're talking about like the 90s.
*  So like see if you can find an ad for a twenty eight inch plasma because they were plasma.
*  And let's say let's just say like ninety six, nineteen ninety seven.
*  I was selling I was working at the Wiz selling cell phones and PCs like pre-built like a Dell, like not Dell.
*  Well, Sony had a had a pentium, you know, Pentium's and very little markup on it was not the good department.
*  I used to make my own.
*  Well, that's what a smarter person would do.
*  An idiot would come to our store and buy it there.
*  Well, I bought that too. I did. I bought just like they were always getting better.
*  But you could do a lot with your you could buy motherboards and you can you learn how to put like the little the jumpers in place with tweezers.
*  You know, it's interesting the tweezers.
*  The jumpers were like master and slave.
*  Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  And I don't know what they call them now.
*  Can you edit this out?
*  Okay.
*  So what year is this?
*  It says 97 is the first Fujitsu plasma screen.
*  It was like 42 inches.
*  Fujitsu.
*  Oh, I think.
*  Is that the first ones?
*  God, I feel like it was more money than that.
*  Still, nine thousand dollars as opposed to four hundred bucks like that.
*  Four hundred dollar one is infinitely better than this fucking clunky hunk of shit with low resolution.
*  No, that's what I'm talking about.
*  That's why I buy it at the very beginning.
*  I mean, it's like dumber than buying a fucking boat in 2003.
*  Plasma TV was ten thousand dollars.
*  Oh, that was 70 inches.
*  That's pretty big.
*  Yeah, like the Black Friday line started getting so crazy because everyone's looking for good TV deals and what not.
*  Right. Right. Right.
*  I killed three men for my TV.
*  Is that what people try to get when they get aggressive?
*  Those are the first those and laptops like the first big things.
*  Black Friday sales are some of the darkest moments in humanity.
*  You see those people fighting over like boxes of shit.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  I think I'm looking at the greatest country on earth, frankly, Joe.
*  That's what I think I'm looking at on Black Friday.
*  Competition.
*  African-American Friday.
*  Excuse me.
*  Excuse me.
*  When you say these guys are getting in trouble on TikTok, like I don't I'm not on TikTok.
*  So what's not you're not a pedophile.
*  So what specifically are they putting up on TikTok that's getting showing off, like blowing shit up into I don't look at it.
*  I don't want to go on TikTok for any reason.
*  I don't care about anything on it.
*  But we have the on Jimmy Show, Jimmy Show, we show clips, you know, like the clip of Wolf Blitzer, the clip of Wolf Blitzer, where he has the the I don't know what rank the guy is.
*  This is in the early part of the war.
*  And the guy's English is not usually have pretty good English, but his isn't great.
*  Right. And Wolf, who used to work for APAC.
*  OK, Wilson, a pro on the side of everything, dude.
*  Right.
*  And he goes, so they just blew up some some refugee camp and to get this one guy to get this one Hamas.
*  And we'll say, wait, you drop blew up before there's 400 and 500 people at that camp.
*  And that's why.
*  And like Wolf's face, he's just like, we got to go.
*  Oh, wait, I forgot the best part.
*  I don't want to say best part.
*  But on Wolf's face, you could see Wolf is like, what in the fuck?
*  This is what I'm talking about.
*  And he goes, well, did you get the guy?
*  He goes, oh, we can't get.
*  They might not even got the guy.
*  And Wolf goes.
*  If they say they can't confirm, they probably didn't get him.
*  Of course.
*  And Wolf. So Wolf knows that.
*  So Wolf, he's like, we have to go to a break.
*  That sticks with me.
*  I need to watch that.
*  I need to watch that.
*  Yeah.
*  I was trying to find it.
*  I have the clip from.
*  So is this one of those ones that's going to get us in trouble?
*  I don't.
*  Probably, right?
*  No idea.
*  Well, let's play it just for us.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  This is it.
*  This is it.
*  OK.
*  Let me hear it.
*  Back now to our breaking news here in the Middle East.
*  A massive explosion at the largest refugee camp in Gaza.
*  Joining us now is Lieutenant Colonel Richard Heck.
*  He's the international spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces.
*  Thanks so much for joining us.
*  I want to ask you first about this massive blast that we all just saw.
*  We saw the video at the Jemezah.
*  Is there anything more you could first of all tell us about how this
*  explosion happened?
*  I will.
*  Thanks for having me.
*  So we'll be coming out in the next hopefully hour with more data.
*  But I can update you.
*  Now that hold on pause.
*  This is a Scottish Israeli dude.
*  Like, what is this?
*  That's possibly that accent's crazy.
*  Do you know Australian Israeli?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  That's crazy.
*  Do you know Australian Israeli?
*  I know.
*  But the accent with the flag, I'm like, my brain is going, what's going on here?
*  I thought you had a clasped palate for a minute.
*  We've got bombs there.
*  Okay, go ahead.
*  Hamas commander in that area.
*  Sadly, he was hiding again as they do behind the within civilians.
*  And that's all I can see at this point.
*  We're looking into it and we'll be coming out with more data as we learn what happened
*  there.
*  Oh, it is Scottish.
*  So can you confirm it was an Israeli attack that destroyed a big chunk of that Jabalia
*  refugee camp?
*  Yes, I can.
*  We went we were focused on our target.
*  Here's where Wolf gets upset.
*  Senior Commander Wolf.
*  I will be updating you with more data as the hour moves ahead.
*  But even if that Hamas commander was there amidst all those Palestinian refugees who
*  are in that in that Jabalia refugee camp, Israel still went ahead and dropped a bomb
*  there attempting to kill this Hamas commander knowing that a lot of innocent civilians,
*  men, women and children, presumably would be killed.
*  Is that what I'm hearing?
*  That's not what you're hearing, Wolf.
*  We again, we're focused on this commander again, who you'll get more data who this man
*  was killed many, many Israelis.
*  We're doing everything we can.
*  These are very complicated battle space.
*  There could be infrastructure there.
*  There could be tunnels there.
*  We're still looking into it and we'll give you more data as the hour moves ahead.
*  But you know that there are a lot of refugees, a lot of innocent civilians, men, women and
*  children in that refugee camp as well, right?
*  This is the tragedy of war, Wolf.
*  I mean, we, as you know, we've been saying for days, move south.
*  The villains are not involved with Hamas.
*  Please move south.
*  I'm just trying to get a little bit more information.
*  You knew there were civilians there.
*  You knew there were refugees, all sorts of refugees.
*  But you decided to still drop a bomb on that refugee camp attempting to kill the Hamas commander.
*  By the way, was he killed?
*  I can't confirm yet.
*  We know that he was killed.
*  He said he was killed.
*  About the civilians there, we're doing everything we can to minimize.
*  I'll say it again.
*  Sadly, they are hiding themselves within civilian populations.
*  Okay.
*  We are doing this stage by stage.
*  It's okay to shoot through all the people.
*  It's sad that there's people.
*  That's normal and that's just war.
*  Putin, by the way, is the most evil man in the world for nothing as fucked up as that.
*  No.
*  So look, hey, they do have to do.
*  Isn't it crazy though when you see the difference between people looking at things objectively versus people that look at things tribally?
*  Yeah.
*  And if you're on the right side, you support Ukraine against Russia.
*  Russia is the invader and Russia is this horrible country.
*  Right.
*  And they won that thing.
*  Right.
*  But this thing, just a disparity in death count.
*  I don't want to hear about Uyghurs ever again.
*  Don't tell me about the fucking Uyghurs because they got a lot better than Gaza.
*  The Uyghurs are living like kings compared to that shit.
*  So all I'm saying is, see, objectively.
*  They got a nice job at a cot.
*  The Uyghurs, they got a nice job at the factory in a cot.
*  They're getting work experience.
*  They're learning to trade.
*  The thing about the Uyghurs is we don't even really know what happens to them.
*  We don't know what they're doing to them.
*  Right.
*  Because they deny that they put them in camps.
*  It's a lot like Guantanamo.
*  No.
*  Well, no.
*  It's like Guantanamo.
*  When I was there, I asked somebody about it because most people, by the way, don't even, if you bring it up, they go, oh, don't say that word.
*  When you say when I was there, you went to Guantanamo Bay or you went to China?
*  No, I went to China.
*  Jesus Christ, Kurt.
*  When I was in Guantanamo.
*  Kurt's part of the deep state.
*  I went to.
*  Let's get out there in Guantanamo.
*  What Israel Soldier videos revealed cheering destruction and mocking Gazans.
*  There you go. Bad optics.
*  Analysis of social media videos found Israeli soldiers filming themselves in Gaza and destroying what appears to be civilian property.
*  The footage provides a rare and unsanctioned window into the war.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's why TikToks.
*  And so the guy from the ADL, we played the recording of him going, I can't remember the name of the, he goes, we need, we got to get out of here.
*  We need, we got to get on this.
*  We need the kind of genius that was behind Talit or people didn't know what he was saying.
*  I'm like, force everybody to use a flip phone like a tell.
*  That's what I said is it all those soldiers should be.
*  No, no, no, you can't trust you assholes with TikTok.
*  You're too wacky.
*  How am I going to brag about what I'm doing?
*  Yeah.
*  How will I brag?
*  Hey, if we could do shit like that, too bad we couldn't.
*  We could have won those two wars we lost out there, huh?
*  If we could just starve.
*  Hey, you're all going to be starved until the Taliban surrenders.
*  Yeah.
*  Why didn't we think of that?
*  Right.
*  We're not as good at fighting as them.
*  I guess is what it is.
*  Well, they're involved in fighting on their own shore every day.
*  Yeah.
*  Against people that they hate with, I would say a racial thing.
*  And I know it's real because I dated Israeli over 10 years and the whole top.
*  Now, here's what I find.
*  I think I'm pleased, Greg, if I'm wrong.
*  But I think if I had converted, because that was like a big thing like, you know, you know, and I think if I had, we could have moved to Israel.
*  And I could claim my birthright of land.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you can move there.
*  Like if you're an American Jew.
*  She has dual citizenship.
*  I could be wrong, but I'll bet you you can do that.
*  Haven't American Jews gone over there to avoid prosecution?
*  Well, every country does that.
*  I mean, that's.
*  But isn't that a thing like American Jews, if someone's coming after them in America?
*  I thought Meyer Lansky tried.
*  Oh, am I thinking of the Godfather where the guy had.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, right.
*  No, Meyer Lansky.
*  Did he do that?
*  But I think there's a thing.
*  Applicants must meet one of the following requirements.
*  One have at least one Jewish birth parent or two have converted to Judaism.
*  That's easy.
*  Well, my wife, you don't need to be religious to qualify to fit in our trips.
*  In fact, many of our participants.
*  Oh, you talk about birthright.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's so he goes.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  The ADL guy goes, we need the people that came up with birthright to put their heads on this tick tock thing.
*  Well, the fucking the Jewish thing is a wild thing because it's a race that you can join.
*  No, it's not.
*  It's a religion.
*  People think of it as a race.
*  Well, you know why?
*  Because Hitler thought of it that way.
*  Sure.
*  Also, a lot of Zionists think of it that way.
*  A bunch of Jewish people don't.
*  You know, ultra orthodox Jews, which I always liked ultra because that's like.
*  But you have to accept that some people feel that Jewish is a race.
*  I. Yeah.
*  Yeah, but this like people that feel like race, there's a bunch of different races and Jewish is one of them.
*  I don't like Jewish people, but but it is a thing, right?
*  It's a thing that some people believe, right?
*  Well, yes.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a thing you can join.
*  Imagine like imagine if you could join being Asian, whoopie Goldberg did it successfully.
*  And she's never looked back.
*  She called the Holocaust white on white.
*  She's she's she did.
*  You don't remember that?
*  Oh, yeah, she did.
*  It was insane.
*  Basically, that's just some white people.
*  It was fucking it wasn't about race.
*  What because she did the homework of anti-racism that she was you were supposed to read those dumb fuck books, but no one believes, by the way, anymore.
*  It's done.
*  You're supposed to learn that anti-racism anti-racism is that it's impossible.
*  I done.
*  Oh, it's far as done with anti-racism.
*  No, no, there's still people embedded like ticks that are but it's it's over because now a bunch of people have finally figured out to have a goddamn lawsuit because all this weird ass shit was never legal.
*  It's been rejected by you know, remember California.
*  I think what did they strike down here or they didn't vote for like and I'm blanking out.
*  But now there's lawsuits up and down and people are winning them.
*  You must have talked this.
*  Didn't do you had James Lindsay on he didn't bring up like any of this of love that somebody from a college just got like 25 million.
*  Oh Starbucks.
*  Remember the girl from Starbucks the manager and these guys want to use the bathroom and it was during the BLM times.
*  Right.
*  And it came out that the higher ups were like she didn't really have any they're like we can't fire a blackbird.
*  So just fire the white manager.
*  So it looks like we've had so and so they're thinking is not about their racial feelings.
*  They're like optics in this media time.
*  So that's what's so gross about bringing these corporations into these moral things because none of them are moral.
*  Right.
*  It's like Mr. Burt.
*  Remember see when Mr. Burns turned good on Simpsons and he made little Lisa slurry and she's like Jesus you're worse when you're trying to be good.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it is.
*  Yeah. Well they're only about money.
*  And if you attach money to a DEI score and say well this is how you get tax breaks and this is how you perverse incentives.
*  Yeah.
*  It's very perverse and it's all just a control thing and it's very ingenious.
*  And it's it's next door neighbors to a social credit score.
*  Right. A DEI score is a corporate score that's not even as good similar to the way the real problem would be.
*  We institute that nationwide.
*  OK. We already have for individuals.
*  So we already have that.
*  First of all there's a whole bunch of people that are debanked the people that I don't even like many of them some that I do.
*  And they've already once to the very concept of shadow banning.
*  You know Ian with who's here with a tell you if I answer.
*  So he got his I think his account shadow banning is why would it be shadow banned.
*  It's like he said like four things are definitely going to get you shadow banned that are not offensive even.
*  But there are things that you shouldn't bring up like around you know covid.
*  Right.
*  And even now on Zuckerberg's platforms that you're not going to be going to be.
*  But why is shadow banning a thing.
*  How is that.
*  How did anyone who isn't a piece of shit go along with the idea that we don't have to tell you what you did.
*  And we're not going to tell you what we're doing to you.
*  And that's all right to do that.
*  OK.
*  Not only that but they're all agreeing that they're going to do something to throttle the opinions of people that have problematic opinions in their eyes.
*  But it's not illegal.
*  How's it working out for you.
*  It doesn't violate any of the customer any agreements that you sign.
*  You signed away all your rights to everything already.
*  So go fuck yourself.
*  But but how does that work.
*  You could do all that goofy shit you want.
*  But my malice is right now.
*  White bill thing.
*  The shit collapses under its weight because you can only go so long telling people to ignore reality.
*  You know how the Soviet Union collapsed from everybody.
*  Like we're getting the stage now with people go we all know it's a scam.
*  And the next stage after that is like wait why am I saying we all know it's a scam about all the things.
*  It's not too far.
*  Next lockdown you lock people down.
*  They got nothing to do but look into shit.
*  That's why a lot of prisoners know like more current events than Bill Maher like people have been down for 20 years because there's nothing to do but read and learn things if you're smart.
*  So they did all society.
*  So some people and they said don't do your own research which is such a suspect.
*  Don't go into daddy's forbidden closet of mystery.
*  Oh OK.
*  I won't.
*  Don't look into Hillary's.
*  That's a hilarious one to infantile eyes people to the point where you're telling them don't research things.
*  Yeah we'll handle that.
*  We're the professionals.
*  Meanwhile we lie all the time.
*  They're doing to us what they did to Haiti and the shit we do to other countries they're going to do to you.
*  So the shit we did to Haiti which is never let them have their own leaders and coup them when they had one elected one.
*  That's us now.
*  Now that's us.
*  We're going to pass the law so you can't vote for the guy you want.
*  Why is he even being allowed to run at all if it's such a fascism has come.
*  I don't understand any.
*  The messages are so mixed and the only way to believe them is to be highly frightened all the time.
*  New York Times has just started doing this new thing on Instagram where they take the actual writers and they have the writers talk about the issues.
*  I'm leaving.
*  And when you see when you see the right they don't understand what they're doing.
*  This is exactly who we thought was writing these things.
*  Very effeminate guy and this woman that it's like the kind of woman it seems like you should never do at a party like like talk down to you.
*  And it's just to your thought.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  The type of people that would you know these like these ultra liberal out of touch people.
*  Yeah.
*  These people are talking about one of the guys is talking about Donald Trump's words being taken out of context that it would be a bloodbath because he was talking about the auto industry and the economy.
*  And then this guy starts bringing up other episodes of violent rhetoric rhetoric.
*  It's hilarious.
*  But yeah guys look.
*  Give me some.
*  What I guess seized on those comments and said they were an example of him calling for violence or predicting violent actions if he didn't win in November.
*  His supporters said that those comments were taken out of context like the punch him in the face.
*  I'll tell you Trump has a history of using violent rhetoric dating back to his 2016 campaign.
*  That language took on new significance after the January 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021.
*  And throughout his third campaign for president he's been getting a lot of attention for the way he talks about violence and retribution on the trail.
*  He suggested that.
*  Exactly.
*  So this is the New York Times.
*  It's all fall apart.
*  These hard nosed reporters with the cop a coffee that are like fucking chasing down Leeds and they're pulling their hair out and they're they're meeting people in back alleyways.
*  This is Woodward and Bernstein.
*  Do people think that's still Watergate.
*  But I mean they're they're essentially like ultra hard left activists that are masquerading as journalists and everything has their opinion on it.
*  They're also they're also age article.
*  They're also masquerading as activists.
*  They're bourgeois twits.
*  They have a lifestyle brand which is I'm a sex in the city guy or gal and I work in the paper.
*  They do the same amount of work as when you see those a day in the life of Google.
*  First of all it's Twitter.
*  Yeah.
*  That video is amazing.
*  Yeah and they don't they don't even make that well New York Times.
*  That's the big time.
*  So all the plum jobs you know like it's all it's kind of similar to when people are mad that Seinfeld they were like demanding you know why riding in to get coffee with Seinfeld in cars isn't a diverse enough.
*  Yeah.
*  And he goes because it's not it's not felt every time they bring these things up to him.
*  I love his fucking response to that.
*  But a place like the New York Times they have to go oh we need to bring these.
*  So all all like exactly how exactly you put it.
*  You could guess what they look like.
*  All of them have moved up from like the Gamergate which at the time I was an adult and I was like I don't care about this but they've all were moving up in the world of media because where's the money coming from.
*  You got to hope you do well enough at making little smear articles on a shitty video game website to get picked for the big leagues and some people did.
*  Yeah.
*  And they've been moving up and then you like me I like oh my god 20 years have passed and then I see like that's that little twerp like if the one that got Shane fired actually went somewhere in life.
*  If I like there's people like him that work with the DHS about the terrorism of you know saying whatever whatever the fuck this idiot's referring to.
*  Well yeah they've they've become embedded in the intelligence community.
*  Well they're all it's all a thing of like your career right.
*  If you want you can you can either say the truth about it about a thing or you can worry.
*  You must not want to have a good career.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh your career go keep all people have to do is not be a punk to their career.
*  I'm not saying careers don't matter I'm saying I will never be a bitch to a fucking career.
*  Who would do that.
*  Yeah but you don't have to see the difference between you and a guy working in government.
*  It's very stark stark contrast.
*  Oh no in government you have comic.
*  Yeah.
*  But even comedian incentives got perverse perverted like I work in government at a certain point.
*  Did they though.
*  Yeah.
*  They only did with people that suck.
*  No they didn't with good comics.
*  I don't mean like I'm not I would never say that dumb shit.
*  You're like woke is killing comedy.
*  No comedy is a thing that's been around the whole time.
*  What it'll kill is like your Disney fucking corporate figuring out how to sell it to people.
*  Yeah that's killing that.
*  Yeah the movies.
*  Right.
*  But not standups the lowest rung dude.
*  This is the one like oh I see it.
*  We were laughing last night I was only telling you about people go he's a failed comic.
*  What I think they mean is that people it's like an insult people throw around.
*  Who about who.
*  Well the example I'm thinking of why I say this is because I sidekick on Jimmy show there's a bunch of people that are like hardcore bloomin no matter who that were like friends of his and mine that are like fuck you you're despicable like this unbelievable.
*  It's your duty.
*  You know like it's your duty to vote for the lesser of two evils member 2016 shit of like the moral outrage.
*  Right.
*  And then but your choices are I didn't pick the right evil for you.
*  That's and you you're judging me for that.
*  Because you didn't take a stand in the right.
*  There's nobody who's not evil.
*  That's the only way it's going to work.
*  They don't even say the right.
*  They don't say the right direction.
*  They go the less evil direction like I'm supposed my heart supposed to swell with emotion.
*  So you're not supposed to stand up and say hey both of these things suck because if you do then you're you're on the wrong side.
*  But mine's better though admit that mine things marginally better than I came to that like a child.
*  There was one I talk about that if you talk about Biden about Biden being corrupt there was oh my god in comparison to Trump like why are we comparing them to Trump.
*  Let's pretend Trump was never born if Trump was never born and it was Biden versus you know fill in the blank.
*  How long was Trump in government.
*  How long was Trump in government.
*  If you're if you have just Trump just Biden versus any politician if they were just running and they get to pull up all this shit that he did while he was vice president all this shit his son was involved in all the stuff that they absolutely know like unaccounted for millions.
*  Where did all that money go.
*  How do these people get all this money.
*  Like what were you doing.
*  How much were you getting paid.
*  Why were you getting paid so much for this in university where you had a job where you never showed up.
*  And you're right.
*  Anybody else that was a Democrat if Biden wasn't president like if Obama was running against Biden.
*  Imagine a world where he wouldn't get taken down.
*  It was like that he ran like that's who he was before he became vice president.
*  He was in 1988.
*  His nickname was Uncle.
*  Uncle Joe.
*  That's not because you're good.
*  They call you Uncle Joe.
*  Like why was he was creepy like creepy uncle.
*  Remember Obama would go.
*  Oh that's Uncle Joe.
*  Because Biden was like get a shotgun.
*  You remember those clips go around where he was like you and that's all.
*  That was when he was running for 2020 or wasn't it.
*  No no no.
*  When he was when he was Obama's vice president and you know he's a gaffe machine.
*  Biden would say goofy shit.
*  Yeah he always he always says goofy shit.
*  This is when his brain worked.
*  Yeah.
*  And the way the white and the White House was hugely embarrassed by it all the time and the way they would do the pitch about it like that's Uncle Joe.
*  That's how they would pitch him.
*  And then he was a Joe.
*  You're saying uncle is like he's old or goofy or dumb.
*  Like how I'm an unmarried uncle of two.
*  I've never heard uncle use as a pejorative before.
*  That's why I'm confused like a crazy uncle.
*  OK.
*  Crazy uncle.
*  Because you're saying Uncle Joe.
*  No like Uncle Joey.
*  We call Joey Uncle Joey.
*  Everybody calls Ted Nugent Uncle Ted.
*  But when they say that's because you see you're thinking about it like a pro.
*  You see you're thinking about it like a poor person right now from their from their standpoint.
*  Their standpoint is a condescending.
*  Oh that's a wacky uncle.
*  That real upper upper class view of calling.
*  You're talking about it like the way someone from a normal place in neighborhood thinks about family.
*  Yeah that's not how they think about it.
*  But I should even run a bunk.
*  It's it's first of all if Trump's only been in government for how long.
*  And he's been there for 50 years and we can go easily look up all the damage he did to all the people.
*  That's why there's so many undecideds and various things because my point about it.
*  Let's pretend Trump doesn't exist.
*  Pretend Trump doesn't exist.
*  I would like to.
*  And then tell me how come RFK Jr.
*  Can't get on the primary.
*  Just tell me if this is a real democracy you tell me why this guy who is a Kennedy who is an environmental attorney who's you know got even though he's got this
*  voice issue he's extremely articulate.
*  Yeah very good speaker very good recall of controversial ideas but who the fuck doesn't have controversial ideas in the world of 2024.
*  Who doesn't have controversial ideas.
*  The guy who's talking about when he talks when he talks you can hear a guy who knows what the fuck he's talking about.
*  That guy from the New York Times in my world has controversial ideas.
*  I think what he's saying is controversial about you know taking things out of context talking about violent rhetoric.
*  By the way Biden and Obama in 2020 were both talking about who could beat each other up.
*  Why?
*  Because they're dumb old dudes.
*  I'll go buy a woodshed.
*  So but he's when he's saying I like to punch him in his mouth.
*  That's what he's talking about.
*  And when he's saying that people should be executed for treason.
*  Well guess what?
*  Don't make me like him.
*  Hold on.
*  That is actually the fucking that's the that's what happens to you if you get tried and convicted for treason.
*  Yeah right.
*  That's the punishment.
*  Yeah.
*  The punishment is execution.
*  It's kind of always been executed.
*  No shit.
*  So what he's saying that that's violent rhetoric with that guy saying in my mind is like trying to look he says bad enough things as it is.
*  Instead of distorting what he says which now makes me not trust you just say what is actually going on.
*  Yes.
*  And also talk about the evidence that shows that Biden is insanely corrupt because both of those things are true too.
*  And if you don't want to talk about one because you think it props up the other you're a part of the problem.
*  You're infantilizing the whole country and treating us like we're children.
*  That's right.
*  We want to know why did an RFK why couldn't he get in the primaries.
*  Like if this is real if this if democracy is real you guys don't just get to decide who runs your party against the will of the entire United States.
*  But they're experts.
*  But isn't that insane that no one has a problem with that but everyone thinks that if Trump gets into office he's going to become a dictator.
*  You've been talking to De Niro again.
*  I don't even listen.
*  I do when De Niro starts talking about Trump I love him too much.
*  I channel is he like you saw you ever see you ever see being there with Peter Sellers.
*  I think he and Trump hate each other personally.
*  I think that is.
*  Yeah I think probably.
*  What are the odds he seems mentally handicapped.
*  I'm not kidding.
*  He seems meant like I don't know.
*  I have a feeling he doesn't know about.
*  Here's some Bill Maher Bill Maher has him on to ask him.
*  I don't it's crazy Bill Maher would ask him anything.
*  You know there's a National Guard in this in the fucking subways and shit.
*  Yeah.
*  So Bill asked him we think about it goes I don't I don't know.
*  I don't know about that if there's anything I can do to help.
*  All I should be asking Robert De Niro about is two things awesome movies and divorce.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Tell me what happened.
*  I would love to ask about divorce.
*  Tell me what happened if you want to talk about it and tell me what happened to you with these awesome fucking movies.
*  I don't need I don't need to know jack shit about his politics.
*  Well he doesn't he doesn't.
*  That's the thing.
*  He just tells you he feels away.
*  That's all he's got to say.
*  But it's almost like it's almost unfair to have a guy like that.
*  Yes.
*  Public show and talk to him about politics.
*  You remind me of when the beauty pageant contestant can't pick a thing on a map and they're making fun of her.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  They mock her.
*  And I'm like is that fair to do to her.
*  That's not her area.
*  Well they made her have a speech and she got stuck in a loop and she couldn't get out.
*  Remember.
*  Yes.
*  Oh no.
*  Remember she didn't know what to say.
*  She's like and then I think she's bad.
*  We need women to do more better.
*  She is right.
*  She's locked up.
*  She's locked up.
*  But everybody is making it seem that she locked up because she's a complete and fucking total idiot.
*  But that's not she's in a pretty contest.
*  Not only but that's not just that dude.
*  Anybody could get locked up like that.
*  You're on stage in front of people with TV cameras pointed at you.
*  You've never experienced that in your life and you have a panic attack.
*  It doesn't mean you're an idiot.
*  And that's also Robert De Niro.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like why is he talking about this?
*  Why is he talking about this publicly?
*  If you're going to come out and say that you have a really deep seeded hatred for one of the two people running for president and you can't just be he's a bully.
*  He's a piece of shit.
*  I hate him.
*  I think you probably if you're going to express yourself about it and alienate 50 percent of the country, which it seems like it is, you're going to have to do better than that.
*  You should have some specific things like he did some real estate deals with people in New York.
*  Let me tell you what he did to fuck people over.
*  I would love to hear it.
*  He did this.
*  Let me tell you what he did that was fraud.
*  He did this and that.
*  Like if you're if you're supporting what New York is doing to him right now, like guess what?
*  You're going to shut down construction.
*  You're going to shut down all these real estate developers who all overvalue their homes.
*  Kevin Leary was talking to him and Leary from Shark Tank was talking to Kevin Leary was we play the clip of the CNN's like yeah.
*  But the girl wasn't dumb either.
*  She knows he's right.
*  Right.
*  They're playing a part on there.
*  It's not that she's stupid.
*  She goes.
*  But isn't it?
*  This is crazy.
*  They cannot say anything positive about Trump and they don't understand.
*  But by doing that, it delegitimizes everything else they say because everyone knows they're coming at the fucking news with a slanted perspective.
*  And there's no objective news.
*  There's it doesn't exist.
*  You have right wing Fox and you have left wing everything else.
*  And you will be fucking confused as shit if you watch both of them back to back.
*  I would just not watch any news for a long while because of that.
*  It's just I have a job where now I have to learn things.
*  Dude has been wild watching you like is all the years that I've known you to watch you like completely flip into full on conspiracy mode.
*  When we first when we first met was probably like what 15 years ago or something like that.
*  Maybe more and I would be frankly smug.
*  I remember making fun of what's her name.
*  Jim Carrey's ex-wife because she thought her kids shot got all Jenny McCarthy.
*  Yeah. And I had a joke on by God just because he's half Canadian.
*  It comes out like but no I was being glib.
*  I was being glib just like Tom Cruise said to Matt Lauer.
*  You're being glib.
*  He was right.
*  I don't think that's not Jim Carrey's kid.
*  That's someone else's kid.
*  That's and I was inaccurate in my mockery as well.
*  I'm pretty sure.
*  But either way the connection.
*  I should have looked into it a little.
*  The connection between vaccines and autism.
*  If you just bring it up people's hackles will get up and they'll start getting don't even talk about you.
*  Yeah they get very upset at you and everybody feels complicit because they vaccinate their kids and everybody feels like they don't want to be attacked by being anti-science.
*  And there's there's that pejorative that gets tossed around that they hit me with so many times during the pandemic and time.
*  You know right dude.
*  But not only that it's not technically a vaccine.
*  It was an experimental medication that had never been widespread distributed to the fucking world.
*  It had never been done.
*  Yeah right.
*  Well biological women have never had dicks before but it's a world of miracles now.
*  Now we live in a world where anything is possible.
*  Better.
*  Yeah.
*  Easier to clean women.
*  Did you see that the bike rider say well I don't know why you could say I'm not a biological woman.
*  I'm a woman and I'm biological.
*  So it's on my passport it says I'm a female.
*  No no no no no no no.
*  Oh you know you're a guy.
*  Touche sir.
*  I'm biological and I'm a woman.
*  That's great.
*  It's so dumb and then whoever I think it's Trevor Noah lets him get away with it.
*  But whoever the fuck it is it's one of those guys is one of the late night guys.
*  It might not have been Trevor Noah.
*  It could be anything.
*  It might have been Jimmy Kimmel or no no it wasn't Jimmy.
*  It wasn't maybe Jimmy Fallon.
*  Either way.
*  No Seth.
*  I think it was Seth.
*  I think it was Seth.
*  But either way.
*  No you're not.
*  You can get a woman pregnant.
*  This is so different.
*  Don't say you're not a biological male because now we're talking in terms of science.
*  If you're getting me to say that you identify as a woman so you're a woman you want me to
*  call you Jill.
*  I'll do it.
*  I'll do it.
*  But if you want to say you are now a biological woman that's not true.
*  And if it says on your passport now female.
*  Someone's lying.
*  Okay.
*  You're lying.
*  You could say you want to be identified as a woman.
*  Who gives a shit.
*  But if you want to say you're a biological woman that's nonsense.
*  Now you're making me deny the scientific understanding of the human body that took forever to achieve.
*  Is that so much to ask?
*  They had to figure out chromosomes.
*  They had to figure out the X and the Y's.
*  They had to figure out all.
*  It's incredible.
*  There's so much they had to work.
*  It is Trevor.
*  No.
*  Look at them fucking pretending it makes sense.
*  Look at the fucking guns on this savage.
*  First of all.
*  Trevor.
*  Listen to this.
*  Listen to this.
*  There's basically no published research on this question.
*  However, there's good reason to think that there isn't.
*  But I think it's irrelevant because we allow all kinds of competitive advantages within
*  women's sport.
*  Because human beings are not just women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  They're women.
*  By the way, out Canadian.
*  They're all goofy up there.
*  It's Portland times 100.
*  Report these Canadians, man.
*  They lost it.
*  Well, keep going with this.
*  I want to hear the rest of it.
*  The fragile, weak, cis white woman from the rest of us.
*  Rest of us.
*  You're a fucking dude.
*  You're a fucking dude.
*  That's not the full clip.
*  The full clip is she goes, well, I am biological and I am a woman.
*  So I'm a biological woman.
*  Just sit there and let someone say that.
*  This is the problem with television.
*  Someone as bright as him too to sit there and not say something.
*  He's playing a game.
*  They're playing a game.
*  You got to stay within the lines.
*  Color within the lines.
*  Otherwise you're going to get in trouble.
*  But obviously like nonsense.
*  Fucking nonsense.
*  I'll call you a woman just for dressing too nice.
*  I got no problem with that.
*  I have no idea.
*  If that's what you'd like me to do, I will do it.
*  That's not the problem.
*  The problem is when you try to get me to deny science, you start saying shit like I'm a
*  biological woman.
*  I should be able to compete with women in women's sports.
*  Men with 80 to 100 times as much testosterone at no competitive disadvantage.
*  And that fact has not been picked up by the broader media.
*  What was that fact?
*  What was that again?
*  Back that up.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure.
*  That fact has not been picked up by the broader media landscape.
*  Oh, go.
*  First of all, stop.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Stop.
*  Hit the brakes.
*  Hit the brakes.
*  So here's the problem with what she's saying.
*  First of all, there's many advantages of being biologically male.
*  There's larger lungs.
*  There's larger hearts.
*  There's larger cardiovascular capacity.
*  There's more of an ability to generate force because you have larger, stronger bodies.
*  This idea that because guys who are cycling, who by the way, when they take their blood,
*  let's try to understand when they're taking their blood because if they're taking their
*  blood and measuring it during a fucking race, they're destroyed.
*  Their bodies are destroyed.
*  It's actually been argued that the Tour de France is actually safer to do on the drugs
*  that Lance Armstrong took.
*  I believe you.
*  Than not on the drugs because it's so insane.
*  Yeah, no, I fully believe that, dude.
*  I believe it too.
*  That's why they all were doing it.
*  Exactly.
*  Well, it's the only way to win.
*  And if you took a look, that was the thing about Lance Armstrong.
*  If you take away his titles, which they supposedly did, but nobody buys it now and everybody
*  knows, you take away his titles, you got to go to 18th place to find a guy who didn't
*  get popped for steroids.
*  It's a fucking dirt.
*  Everyone knows now.
*  It's a dirty.
*  Yeah, everyone knows.
*  Everyone knows.
*  No one gives a shit.
*  Lance Armstrong can go anywhere.
*  Nobody gives a shit.
*  Because I always thought that was fucked the fuck up.
*  It's fucked.
*  Okay.
*  Males with the highest testosterone levels were significantly faster than the 20 meter
*  and 30 meter sprint trials compaled to males with lower testosterone levels.
*  Yeah.
*  Shut the fuck up.
*  You're lying.
*  Well, you know what makes me, but for them to like just sit there and let that person
*  say that and broadcast it on television, like this isn't live.
*  You can check that.
*  You can stop.
*  Oh, good point, dude.
*  Yeah.
*  You could research the thing.
*  Yeah.
*  You're making a point, a very important point saying that there's no competitive advantage
*  which we all know to not be true, which is why athletes get popped taking testosterone.
*  There's a guy from the USC.
*  It doesn't work.
*  There's a guy from USC, Juan Harris, one of the UFC heavyweights.
*  He just got popped.
*  He gets suspended for four fucking years because they found non-endogenous, exogenous testosterone.
*  Oh, endogenous is...
*  Human body produces it.
*  Okay.
*  They found it of...
*  They actually get it from wild yams, which is kind of crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  No shit.
*  Yeah.
*  They make exogenous testosterone from wild yams.
*  I never heard that.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like a wild...
*  I believe it's a Mexican yam.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  That's why Mexicans have so many kids eating those yams and fucking up the store and starting
*  cocktails and doing...
*  But yeah.
*  So when I had Novitsky on, who was the head of USADA, who was the guy who busted Lance
*  Armstrong, he was saying that conceivably they might be able to get around this by developing
*  testosterone of animal origin, like extracting testosterone from animals, which could be
*  possible.
*  But right now that's theoretical.
*  But we know that they can find out whether the testosterone that's in your system is
*  exogenous or endogenous based entirely on the carbon isotope profile.
*  So they do these carbon isotope tests and then they can find out if it's from the wild
*  yams or if it's from a human being.
*  With carbon, you measure all kinds of shit.
*  I might have butchered that, obviously, because I'm a moron, but I'm pretty sure...
*  Not as much as that chick in that clip.
*  Yeah, well that chick is a guy, and a liar, and who's trying to justify what they're doing
*  dominating a woman's sport with their goofy fucking rainbow glasses on that they're not
*  just cheating.
*  Because what they're doing is cheating.
*  And what he's doing is being a little fucking cheating supporter by letting this person
*  say these lies, which he as a fucking man knows isn't true.
*  Well, okay, this is what I find unbelievable.
*  So she just said some bullshit about, well, there's no study that shows this net.
*  So you know all this shit about testosterone.
*  I saw the footage of how it works out in the thing.
*  We don't have to talk about none of that.
*  You won.
*  You beat everybody.
*  I'm watching you like Captain America running around the black guy on the track in the second
*  one.
*  Are you like, whoa, how'd that guy beat that black guy that bad?
*  Like, what?
*  Is everybody fucking crazy?
*  We don't need to get into none of it.
*  You just happen to be a woman and be the best ever.
*  I go full force.
*  The best move you can make is to be fully into it.
*  And I say the women plus community, it's about time.
*  Leave those losers in your wake.
*  Dude, I find it hilarious.
*  This is what the most like thing that has made me snap, you know, over the last couple
*  years.
*  This is the thing?
*  Well, no, this thing.
*  This is the thing?
*  Not this specific thing.
*  But you, you've been snapping.
*  No, no, no.
*  Like, like.
*  You've had a lot of things that made you snap.
*  What I mean by is.
*  I don't think you can narrow it down.
*  I mean what snap.
*  No, I can.
*  I can pinpoint it.
*  I can fucking pinpoint it.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  And when I say snap, I mean, I'm not on any side of left or right and I'm not voting for
*  president.
*  I don't believe in any of it.
*  Right.
*  And I went back, my black friends in comedy in New York, although I haven't talked to
*  God for yet, I apologize to them personally for dismissing their conspiracy shit.
*  Every black guy conspiracy that I was told that I went, like.
*  I apologize to them.
*  Like which one?
*  Oh, when I see Godfrey, I tell him, because Godfrey used to come on Race Wars with me
*  and shot and he'd go, yeah, they want to put black men in a dress.
*  And I would go, nobody twisted Flip Wilson's arm.
*  And little did I understand.
*  Of course they do.
*  They want to put everyone in a dress except women.
*  Like.
*  I'll give an apology because they want everyone emasculated.
*  But not very many white men.
*  It's way more black men.
*  If you think about the number of.
*  Whoever scares you the most.
*  Right.
*  Put them in a dress.
*  That's why the rock has to be in a tutu.
*  It's on point.
*  Put Brock Lesnar in a dress.
*  Right.
*  If he wants to be in the movies, he should do that.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Because you're scary.
*  Oh, he's a nice, not as scary.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And especially these like feminine men that sound like New York Times reporters are the
*  ones who are putting together these films.
*  You know, it'd be great.
*  Put the rock in a tutu.
*  Get his toes done.
*  Get his toes done.
*  Get a mani and a peni.
*  So much of that is that by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  No, that uptalk.
*  Well, basically his it was violet.
*  Here's my advice.
*  Here's my basic advice.
*  When anyone is talking about anything important and they talk like this, don't listen.
*  It means they're not sure what they're saying is real.
*  So they're hedging their language.
*  Unless you're like deep in tech, unless you're like a programmer and you just like you're
*  basically talking like, you know, people down here say, y'all, you know, like if you're
*  you live in Boston, you got a Boston accent.
*  You know, like you're a.
*  You're like.
*  Like if you're you live in Boston, you got a Boston accent, you know, that's you like,
*  okay, you're just trapped.
*  You know who that guy is on Twitter.
*  He'll say y'all.
*  Hey, y'all.
*  Right.
*  D.
*  I.
*  But they're not.
*  He's not from the south.
*  They don't want to say guys.
*  So they say guys can say y'all.
*  Whereas like that one, a straight guy who's in a football who lives in New York, they
*  don't say y'all.
*  Hey, y'all want to go get a fucking pizza.
*  Do you want to get pizza?
*  You use use.
*  Yeah.
*  But you don't say y'all if you're a straight guy in New York City who's like from Long
*  Island, maybe for a joke, who wants to go get pizza.
*  You don't want to get pizza.
*  Like what?
*  Y'all.
*  Who the fuck are you?
*  You don't say that appropriation.
*  Guys allowed to appropriate southern culture.
*  Well, I've got to say y'all on ironically, I've been here for years.
*  They're the fashion segment on our human centipede that is our country.
*  So of course they digest it and then shit it into your into your mouth.
*  All the ladies in my family have adopted y'all.
*  I find it too preposterous at 56 years old to step in and change my vernacular.
*  This is exactly what I was complaining about is what you just said right there.
*  You just go start saying y'all.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck you.
*  They like it.
*  They like saying y'all.
*  It's fun for them.
*  They like being Texan.
*  So it's cool.
*  I don't have a problem with it, but they're also not on television talking about Gaza.
*  All I need to understand that there are tunnels under all of those hospitals.
*  Y'all need to know.
*  Y'all need to come up out of them tunnels.
*  First of all.
*  Yeah.
*  Like how about you tell Hamas enough because if you don't that was the thing that drives
*  me the most crazy when people talk about, you know, well Hamas is doing this and Hamas
*  doing that.
*  These people they voted in Hamas.
*  Like these people are the poorest of poor, deprived of sanitation, education, proper
*  hospital care, food.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  How are they going to rise up?
*  Just run out and get shot en masse until the Hamas runs out of bullets and then you bludgeon
*  them to death with rocks.
*  Look, what are you saying?
*  The voting for Hamas, by the way, they forced a vote there.
*  They're like you have to have a democratic process.
*  And then they voted for him.
*  The same way Fatah became a party so that they voted.
*  Then they go, you voted wrong.
*  We're putting you in a concentration camp.
*  And so, okay, why did you have them have a vote if there was a voting for Trump is Hamas
*  here for that for like Keith Olbermann kind of people.
*  Trump is voting vote for Trump is voting for Hamas.
*  It was in 2016.
*  That's why they've been punishing us with shitty movies because they're like you're
*  Hamas.
*  Now I want to just punish us with shitty movies.
*  Everybody in 2016 when they were like we need to destroy all masculinity on this planet
*  in all of media because you are Hamas, frankly, all of you for voting them for that.
*  It really made my ratings go up because it was like a bottleneck.
*  It was like there was no.
*  Yeah, it's like you could be a guy.
*  You could.
*  That's where the hatred is.
*  Yeah, that's part of it.
*  Yeah, it's foolish.
*  It's so foolish.
*  It's threatening to people.
*  It's only threatening to morons.
*  All different perspectives are only threatening to morons unless those people with that different
*  perspective are trying to control your life or trying to fucking cheat and pretend that
*  they're a girl and dominate girl sports.
*  It just takes rainbow glasses.
*  All you got to do.
*  Yeah, rainbow glasses and you're in.
*  I extra believe you because you have your jacked arms.
*  How much can that dude deadlift?
*  That dude looks like a house.
*  Does that dude still have a dick?
*  That's what I want to know, which is the most crazy.
*  I hope so because that is the most crazy one that they can have sex with women.
*  His girl dick.
*  His she-ness.
*  And then go into the locker rooms and wave that dick around everybody's face and everybody's
*  fine with it.
*  It's a woman.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm more than fine with it.
*  I had no idea this was even going down until I criticized that fighter, that Fallon Fox
*  fighter that fought twice without telling women that she was trans.
*  It's like a dating service.
*  You're not supposed to say, can you tell me if...
*  It's hilarious.
*  I saw comics arguing that, yeah, you shouldn't have to tell people.
*  What the fuck are you saying?
*  You should have to tell people you owe taxes.
*  You should have to tell people everything.
*  You should have to tell people everything.
*  If you're getting involved with a woman and you're really into her and she's really cool
*  and let's say you make 150 grand a year, you're doing great.
*  And you find out this lady is like $90,000 in debt to the IRS.
*  You're like, what?
*  And you think about getting married, you're like, now I take that on?
*  Hey.
*  Why are you so in debt?
*  What the fuck?
*  I feel like it's a scam.
*  Like I got played if I found out some shit like that.
*  I don't think I should have to tell a woman that I'm married.
*  But if you're a guy and you find out that this person that you're falling in love, you're
*  thinking about having a family with and God, she's so cool.
*  And then you go, oh, you have a dick?
*  That seems like you should tell people that.
*  Well, Jerry Springer tried to handle those disputes back in the day.
*  My favorite one is there's this trans guy with a hijab on and says, people are saying,
*  why are you cosplaying?
*  I am not cosplaying.
*  Cosplaying is when you're pretending to be something you are not.
*  I am a Muslim woman.
*  That's why I am wearing the traditional Muslim.
*  And then there's this like lady, this Middle Eastern lady goes, I will pay for a one trip
*  round first class ticket for you to go there.
*  You won't need round trip because you're not coming back.
*  Yeah.
*  What are you talking about?
*  You know what it is?
*  It's like you should have gone with more burka, dude.
*  Put a full burka.
*  Right.
*  Cover the whole deal.
*  Because that's like an elegant wearable pronoun with no surgery.
*  But the full deal.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, oh, that's a woman.
*  And you're like, does she have a dick?
*  I don't know.
*  I'm not her husband.
*  Either way, at the end of the day, you're flying off a fucking roof.
*  Like this thing, this is a game that you can only play in America.
*  You try playing that in these countries that you support.
*  You support Hamas.
*  Do you really?
*  OK.
*  Yeah, we support Hamas.
*  Go over there.
*  You saw there with these fucking rainbow shirts on and watch what they do to you.
*  Like, what are you fucking saying?
*  You go to most parts of you saw Bruno.
*  Right.
*  OK.
*  He almost got beaten to death for walking around all gay in that Hasidic area.
*  And he tried to go provoke in Syria like Islamic terrorists by being Bruno.
*  And he would show him gay porn.
*  And they would go, oh, John Kiriakou tells a story.
*  He was a consultant.
*  And they would go, oh, that is no good.
*  They put on their glasses these old ass terrorists.
*  He'll go an extra mile to find the people for the thing.
*  And they'll look at him and they'll go, no, that is no good.
*  When he went to Israel, that dude never breaks character.
*  He had to break character to tell the Yeshiva students, hey, no,
*  I'm Sasha Cohen.
*  So they didn't beat him to death.
*  So like, anybody trying to look, the gay thing attaching it to a cause
*  is the same as if you're my friend's an animator and the animators union
*  has declared a position on Gaza.
*  That's to break their union, to attach it.
*  There's nothing to do with you.
*  If you're work, we're for Palestine.
*  I almost think it's an opp or something because that's deliberately
*  attaching something that is you don't don't attach your cause BLM.
*  We support Hamas.
*  They were very forthcoming right in the beginning.
*  And a bunch of Dippy liberal Jews gave him money, didn't you?
*  And they told you they liked Hamas.
*  But just now you're mad.
*  You just now figured out because you don't listen to people.
*  So like every cause, it's important.
*  Oh, that is important.
*  Your gay cause, it should be its own thing.
*  Don't try to attach it to a thing that's not local with you.
*  That is a bunch of people dying.
*  That's a really important thing on its own.
*  But that's how people think is you try to like how we do laws.
*  You know, you put earmarks.
*  You don't try to earmark other people's fucking rights thing
*  with your rights.
*  Supporting Hamas is insane.
*  Well, then why did you do it?
*  Palestine.
*  Yeah, right.
*  That's the crazy thing that Dave Smith told me about.
*  The fact it's not top secret.
*  Not only is it not top secret that people were in the streets of Israel.
*  They're about to throw testing hundreds of thousands of people in the streets
*  for months before October 7th.
*  That's why I say read Israeli news.
*  He was about to be on a show.
*  It shows you like how segmented all this shit is because it used to be that woke
*  included like any form of anti-semitism.
*  Exactly fucking right.
*  Right.
*  October 7th was when the woke ended with October 7th.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's when a bunch of people found out that what Whoopi said was right.
*  What white on white violence.
*  Like they're like, oh, I thought I was John Stewart's a classic like, oh, I'm like,
*  but we should be together.
*  We're like, no, no, no.
*  And they told you in BLM Times, by the way, if you paid attention,
*  but you dismiss them because you're like, you don't.
*  I'm telling you, that was the end of it.
*  Because now a bunch of all this woke shit, you know, people go to the left.
*  And I don't believe we I think it's a puppet show.
*  I don't think we have any real thing besides the corporation.
*  But they would push this shit like we're all in this together.
*  And then that's when you started seeing the Instagrams of like,
*  I stood with immigrants because blah, blah, blah.
*  I stood with BLM because and I stood with gays.
*  And now I stand alone because I am a Jew.
*  Do you see that getting passed around?
*  Yeah.
*  And that's the moment when I knew right there it was like, oh, you're like that
*  ADL piece of shit was shocked.
*  Well, you're not going to back us up all the way on this thing.
*  We followed you on all your crazy shit.
*  What?
*  ADL thing with who?
*  The guy from the ADL was furious on October 7th when they went on Warpath
*  because the Wokeys weren't supporting Israel.
*  The ADL supported that like that kind of bullshit we just watched.
*  They supported that.
*  They supported BLM.
*  So now this is how you repay us by not going along with everything we're doing.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's why I'm saying Woke died on that day.
*  It should have been dead a long time ago.
*  Yeah.
*  People understand that it's just crazy now.
*  The lefties couldn't.
*  It's just tribal.
*  It's very tribal.
*  And it's very like even in the right.
*  Like look what's going on with Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro.
*  Like what did she say?
*  I want to know what she was fired for because was it criticism of Israel?
*  I mean did she show that Edward Snowden video that he put up on Twitter that shows them
*  maybe drone bombing those kids that are those men, I should say unarmed people that were
*  walking towards the rubble that clearly weren't causing any danger to anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Bomb them.
*  You know, it's your duty.
*  It's just like for Biden or whoever you like.
*  You're supposed to cover up for them because the whole thing is like they're always saying
*  they're only targeting Hamas and everybody else is a casualty.
*  Well, if those guys are just unarmed civilians and they're walking alone, that's what they
*  appear to be.
*  Dressed in.
*  And you just blast them from the sky with robots.
*  This is the tragedy of war.
*  Yeah, this is insane.
*  And no one knows what to think now because if you can't talk about that, if you can't
*  say that's real, then you're saying that genocide is okay as long as we're doing it.
*  And that is what we're saying.
*  And if you're saying that from a perspective of someone who literally went through the
*  Holocaust or your people, your tribe went through the fucking Holocaust and now you're
*  willing to do it.
*  I hope the irony is not lost on you.
*  It's so nuts.
*  It's so hard to imagine that someone where a culture like a country was like officially
*  founded in what?
*  Forty seven?
*  Forty eight.
*  Forty eight.
*  Okay.
*  Officially founded.
*  So that's so recent.
*  And you guys are willing to do what was done to you that led you to believe that you needed
*  to start your own country?
*  You're willing to do that at least on a small scale in Gaza.
*  Like there's nothing left.
*  If you see the videos.
*  Let's see some recent footage of Gaza because they have they stopped bombing?
*  I know people are calling for cease fires.
*  Well, you know, you know what I think is going to help?
*  In San Francisco, the city council all got together with mass on and they voted on a
*  cease fire and then they all danced.
*  Yes, they won.
*  The cease fire passed.
*  The cease fire passed, which is really important.
*  And when it passed, they were all these fucking freaks with blue hair all dancing around
*  with masks on.
*  Please show that because it's one of the most wonderful things on the Internet.
*  These people are swimming in a sea of human shit with needles flying by like logs on a
*  raging river.
*  With the wrong kind of mask on.
*  Everyone's in a tent.
*  Robberies are out of control.
*  The fucking stores have all moved out of your town.
*  And would you vote on?
*  Not me.
*  You vote on a cease fire in Gaza.
*  You got to see it though.
*  You got to see it.
*  Watch.
*  I got to find it.
*  Okay.
*  It's so preposterous.
*  It must be readily available unless the Google is trying to hide the truth.
*  You know what it reminds me of?
*  It reminds me of how our own government, instead of fixing any of this, just gave all our money
*  to Ukraine.
*  It's very similar.
*  The concern for somewhere else that's not your immediate area.
*  You should probably clean your room like Jordan Peterson says.
*  America, the Pentagon, how about we clean our room?
*  How about you clean your fucking room, bitch?
*  There's people all over the fucking floor.
*  Like how about when G.J.
*  Ping came to San Francisco and they did clean it.
*  Can he come more often?
*  They did clean it.
*  Can you get an apartment there?
*  If G.J.
*  Ping got a penthouse in San Francisco, it would clean up the whole problem.
*  Hey buddy, when you coming back?
*  What a baller G.J.
*  Ping is.
*  He can force the enemy to clean up their horrible city.
*  He didn't have to force.
*  They wanted to.
*  Look at these freaks.
*  Look at these freaks.
*  Anti-Palestinian sentiments, Islamophobia and xenophobia.
*  But not everyone agrees with this resolution.
*  But people are fighting.
*  But look at them all dancing around.
*  They all have masks on.
*  Look at these fucking crackpots.
*  Those are the right masks.
*  Yeah, the fucking K and whatever the fuck they are.
*  The Faceyomika.
*  Look at these fucking people.
*  They are literally insane.
*  All of them mentally ill, wearing masks.
*  But those liberals, they are fucking blue to the death.
*  They are in a full on suicide cult.
*  They have watched the K of their city and they like it.
*  They are happy.
*  Until they get personally attacked and then they wake up.
*  But until they get personally attacked, they are all in on equity.
*  Look at these fucking freaks.
*  They have the Palestinian traditional scarves on and shit.
*  Look at all these people.
*  They are such crackpots.
*  Look at all the dead eggs.
*  And that's just the guys.
*  Well, how many of those guys are guys?
*  I mean, who knows what's going on with that group of people.
*  We got three generations forwards, those big head gray aliens.
*  That's sick for wondering what are they turning into.
*  I wonder how many trans men become conservative.
*  They start juicing them up with testosterone.
*  They go, you know what?
*  These fucking guys are making a point.
*  It is all about discipline and hard work.
*  I wonder what the political leanings of trans men are.
*  A Reddit comment on the video says they are covering their faces on purpose so they don't
*  get identified.
*  Oh, shut the fuck up.
*  Those people wear those goddamn things everywhere.
*  And why kill the fun, Jamie?
*  Why even pull that up?
*  Why even inform me of the truth?
*  These people made a difference.
*  Can we celebrate it?
*  I'm trying to have a biased worldview like the New York Times.
*  Just in a different direction.
*  Should I cut my subscription off?
*  I want the worldview I'm entitled to.
*  Don't show up wearing scarves to be paid attention to and then want to cover your face, you fucking
*  coward.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  That's part of the problem is everybody wants to be performative, but nobody wants to take
*  the heat.
*  Put your fucking face out there, god damn it.
*  This is nonsense.
*  People should know that you're a nonsense person, but they do know because they know
*  that San Francisco is imploding.
*  So you know just by watching the city.
*  That's why they move there so they can fucking like be a nonsense person.
*  Well they probably were there forever.
*  There's a lot of people that have been there forever.
*  But then there's also like benefits to living there if you're a homeless person.
*  They actually pay you money.
*  They pay you money.
*  There's a lot of services like they're just there's a giant goddamn industry that's involved
*  in homeless.
*  And that's one of the things that Coleon Noir uncovered on the show.
*  It's not Colin.
*  Well, his name is Collins.
*  His real name is Collins.
*  Yeah, Coleon.
*  Coleon is his Instagram.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  So anyway, he went to San Francisco and he was like, what is it?
*  A funding issue?
*  Like what's going on?
*  He's like, this is crazy.
*  And one of the people he's talking to was a lawyer and he's a lawyer as well.
*  And so when the guy was talking to him, he was saying, no, no, no, you don't understand.
*  It's a scam.
*  Like there's a giant industry and there's all these people that make hundreds of thousands
*  a year working in the homeless department.
*  They don't want to clean up the homeless.
*  Their jobs go away.
*  And if they're the only people in charge of cleaning up the homeless, it's basically like
*  those Boeing mechanics that get those sign off on their own work.
*  Like, oh, yeah, it's great.
*  I did a great job.
*  Oh, I didn't know that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's why fucking blades are cracking out of the sky, kid.
*  But when you that's what the whistleblower thing was all about.
*  No, I knew that whistleblower was insinuating was that they have done a horrible disservice
*  by not having safety inspectors instead of letting the mechanics sign off on their own
*  work.
*  They're trying to save money and cut corners.
*  And by doing that, he's saying this is super fucking dangerous.
*  And he's saying all these problems that they found with planes.
*  And then he decided that what he had done was so horrible that he needed to leave this
*  earth because he felt guilty for being a snitch.
*  Yeah.
*  He also disparaged a great company.
*  Definitely.
*  My grandfather worked for them.
*  He definitely wasn't killed.
*  No.
*  Well, people, a lot of suicide.
*  Sorry, I've been sniffling.
*  Yeah, that one was a fun one.
*  That story.
*  Commit suicide.
*  If you're going to commit suicide, definitely do it before you testify.
*  Well, you know, remember the guy that figured out how they were bringing crack into the
*  hood just as the rapper said, and he shot himself twice in the head because he felt
*  so guilty?
*  No, you're you're conflating a few things.
*  You're you're thinking about Gary Webb.
*  No.
*  Oh, that's Gary Webb.
*  I was talking to Michael Rupert.
*  He was another one.
*  Oh, no.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he was the guy that but Gary Webb did that as well.
*  Michael Rupert was actually a Los Angeles narcotics investigator.
*  And he's talking in the assembly.
*  That's the guy who says, right.
*  Right.
*  It was on C-SPAN, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I'm sorry, Gary Webb, because we had a quote from right.
*  Right.
*  Gary Webb was the guy who shot himself in the head twice.
*  It happens.
*  Well, if you do it once, you probably should finish the job.
*  Hey, you fuck up.
*  You blow the top of your head.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I'm still alive.
*  I do a starter shot to see if I like it.
*  Yeah.
*  I see if I want to go all the way.
*  Because first of all, you know how hard you get knocked out if you shot yourself in the
*  head?
*  It's not like you're just going to be fine.
*  I don't know.
*  I would never do that.
*  Well, he goes here's a quote where he goes, I realized when he was reporting on that story,
*  I had never reported anything important in my entire life until that.
*  Because when that happens, when you shoot yourself placed in the head, that means you
*  did report on a real thing.
*  And sometimes you had no I over and over.
*  I hear from people like Jay Bhattacharya, the doctor, where they find something wrong
*  and they think everyone's going to be happy.
*  They found the problem, you know, because this is important.
*  And no, it's bad for business.
*  Just like the homeless thing you said, that's everything.
*  Everything is incentivized to keep the thing going.
*  Exactly.
*  It's all about money.
*  And that's the number one curse of our culture and humanity.
*  But it's also like the thing that makes people want to fight against it, which makes good
*  people rise up.
*  So you got like a bunch of factors that are happening at the same time.
*  And it probably forces more of these good people to be more good and more just because
*  they realize like, hey, there really is evil in the world.
*  You know, it's God's anvil for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's real, what did you say?
*  God's anvil to hammer you out on.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like it's almost like you need something.
*  I think there's always been something that people have been battling against.
*  There's always been evil and good, at least in some sense of it.
*  It gets so confusing when the good does evil to justify fighting the evil.
*  It's like, OK, well, what are you?
*  Are you in a rush to kill Hamas?
*  Will you have to kill everybody else too?
*  But just truth and lies.
*  Just tell the truth.
*  Because good and evil, I mean, I believe in those things abstractly, but it's such a vague
*  thing to say.
*  Right.
*  And there's depends on what side you're on.
*  There's apparently radically different views on what constitutes that.
*  Like that poor woman who's being persecuted in sports that you attacked earlier because
*  of your phobia.
*  Yes.
*  That was evil.
*  That's evil.
*  You should feel ashamed that you said that she can't.
*  Look, like I said, right now, it's gotten so crazy that all you got to do is just not
*  think about how will that am I being a loose cannon by just pointing at the thing that's
*  in front of my fucking face?
*  Right.
*  Everybody could just start by doing that, by not, you know, don't all my friends back
*  when the thing is that all these D.I.
*  The scores that these corporations have, this is a giant percentage of the population that's
*  under Sauron's eye all day long.
*  It's called slavery.
*  It is kind of a form of mental slavery.
*  It's not you could always quit the credit system, but there's something about it that's
*  so creepy.
*  They're enforcing for the first time in the history of our culture, they're enforcing
*  an ideology on the masses and they're changing our definitions of what's acceptable and what's
*  not acceptable, including men competing against women.
*  And they've dabbled in minor attracted persons.
*  They're dabbling in people who are two spirit or elf kin or fucking they're dabbling in
*  the most extreme weird stuff.
*  It's just sort of like prime you and get you ready for furries.
*  Furries are fine.
*  I will never accept them.
*  Well, furries are having a good time and they're dressing up like chipmunks.
*  I'll tell you what, when Duncan and I did a podcast as furries, I got my respect for
*  the furry community because it's hard to keep those things on.
*  I can't imagine fucking with those things on.
*  It gets hot.
*  And this is a cool studio, you know, the temperature is controlled.
*  This is gross.
*  You put that thing on, dude, and you know what a diaper furry is?
*  Yeah, they shit.
*  That's the lowest form of furry.
*  Oh, the regular ones shit in litter boxes.
*  No, I hunt them.
*  So I'm going to tell you what to look for.
*  You'll smell them coming.
*  Now, Joe, I have a job, as you know, turning off people's smart houses for being racist.
*  So the way I see it, it's a good thing.
*  Want to hear a furry story?
*  So this is a two parter.
*  No, but yes.
*  I will tell you, I know one.
*  We were in Pittsburgh for UFC and we just randomly happened to get there on the day.
*  There's a furry convention.
*  So as we are driving the odds, crazy odds, as we're driving from the airport in a rental
*  car going, what the fuck is going on, dude?
*  There's so many mascots.
*  No, no, no fucking idea.
*  No idea.
*  So finally we get to the hotel.
*  The hotel bar, the manager guy explains to us there's a furry convention.
*  You guys got lucky quite a few years ago.
*  What a way to find out.
*  At least, I mean, it's probably in the neighborhood of 20 years ago.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  And you just said.
*  So now the UFC popped in 2005.
*  It's probably after that.
*  Any diapers?
*  So maybe, no, I think I might be off.
*  Maybe 15 years ago or 14, 15.
*  Anyway, quite a while, at least a decade ago, a long time ago.
*  So I'm not that hip on furries.
*  I didn't understand.
*  You absolutely shouldn't be.
*  I get there and the guy tells me that he had a request for someone to put a litter box
*  in the, he goes, first of all, he goes, you're really lucky you guys made reservations in
*  advance because everything is sold out because of the furry convention.
*  And I'm like, what?
*  So he explains they all want their food delivered in bowls on the floor.
*  And these people are all furries together in this one hotel.
*  So they're acting out there in the lobby together.
*  They're all furries.
*  Everywhere we go, there's furries.
*  They're sicker than Cosby.
*  And they're nice.
*  I don't care if you dress like a fucking squirrel.
*  The bowl thing is you got to participate in my weird act.
*  Well, it's a request.
*  You know, you put the food in the bowl, I'm paying money.
*  You know, I'm a freak.
*  I'll do it.
*  Put it on the ground.
*  I'll give you an extra 20.
*  Yeah.
*  So, but he told me that they wanted to put a litter box.
*  One of the guys requested a litter box in the lobby so that they could piss in it.
*  And he's like, no, you can't have a fucking litter box in the lobby.
*  There's like sanitation issues.
*  But he's like, dude, it's so crazy.
*  So anyway, years go by and I'm hanging out with a friend of mine in Utah in the mountains,
*  elk hunting.
*  And he tells me that his wife is a teacher at this school and that one of the parents
*  had requested putting a litter box in the girl's bathroom because the girl identifies
*  as a furry or a cat or whatever.
*  So I go, what?
*  Are you fucking serious?
*  So I talk about that on the podcast and then people call bullshit.
*  They say there's no evidence.
*  There's no evidence.
*  But the attack, the amount of people that were calling bullshit was crazy.
*  And they were angry and it got connected to trans stuff.
*  So somehow or another, me telling a story, my friend told me that his wife told him about
*  this public school that she worked at where they were in Utah where they were saying that
*  a mother was requesting a litter box.
*  So I go back to him and I say, OK, listen, man, I need to know.
*  Like what?
*  Ask your wife.
*  What is what actually happened?
*  So the wife didn't work at that school anymore because it was like a year or so ago or maybe
*  even more.
*  So anyway, the wife says what I recall was that a mother had requested that a litter
*  box be installed in the girls room.
*  I said, was a litter box ever installed?
*  I don't think so.
*  Or I don't know.
*  OK, well, that's it.
*  But the idea that people wouldn't want to shit in a litter box if you're dressing up
*  like a furry does.
*  Why is that so far fetched that everyone's so angry for fetch and saying that I'm pumping
*  out misinformation when I talk to a fucking manager of a hotel told me personally, he
*  got a request to put a litter box in the lobby during a first true.
*  That's why.
*  Why are they so aggressive about that one?
*  That seems so weird.
*  I don't care if you want to wear a fucking chipmunk outfit and have sex with each other.
*  Have a good time.
*  If that's what you're both into, who cares for the same reason?
*  Why is it weird if you are you saying that there's kids?
*  There's no kids out there that are so mentally ill that they want to use a litter box because
*  I don't know.
*  I'm saying shut up about it.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Don't talk about it.
*  Right.
*  It's so selfish.
*  But I don't think you're right.
*  I don't think anybody would be willing to say that there's no one out there who's not
*  mentally ill enough to want to use a litter box because of course there is.
*  There's a spectrum of mental illness.
*  I'm saying it's not mentally ill.
*  It's fine.
*  It's the depth of what?
*  Yes.
*  That's what gets really weird about the whole minor attracted persons thing.
*  They're trying to slip that in as an identity and people say, why are you talking about
*  this?
*  It is real.
*  You have to understand it seems so crazy.
*  It seems crazy to me.
*  I don't want to bring it up.
*  I don't want to talk about it because it makes you look like a fucking loon.
*  It's a good point.
*  But it is real and there's recordings, there's video of politicians expressing how we have
*  to recognize their identity as minor attracted persons.
*  I won't look at it.
*  I've seen it.
*  It's infuriating and it's the same kind of people that you expect to be using those New
*  York Times Instagram videos.
*  They're talking about the story they're covering.
*  It's the same kind of people.
*  It's cult members.
*  When you said you could imagine what they look like, it reminded me of like back when
*  I remember like all those famous nudes came out on fucking the fappening.
*  It was called the news.
*  Yes.
*  And so I was watching some video came on my stream on YouTube about it and I'm looking
*  and they're talking about, you know, they hacked and got their stuff and their their
*  communications.
*  And then immediately the guy, like the one guy that got arrested, he looked so much like
*  what I imagined.
*  He looked like an AI read my mind and drew him on this.
*  That's amazing.
*  And the big thing is autism is apparently the biggest is huge.
*  And so shit like furries and there's all these malleable people that are like they're real
*  smart about like making like lists and iceberg lists of shit.
*  Right.
*  But they're like two dimensional like Sailor Moon brain.
*  That's why I asked you.
*  This is old.
*  This reverence.
*  But Chris Chan, do you not have you not?
*  Ken Burns documentaries about it.
*  That guy or woman now.
*  But what are you talking about?
*  You went in 30 different directions.
*  What is Chris Chan?
*  What?
*  It's the most documented human ever, ever.
*  You've never heard of him, right?
*  No.
*  This is such an old ass reference.
*  Like if somebody is like, yeah, I know about Christian.
*  But when I first saw about Christian, Jamie, I can't say I've never seen the picture, but
*  I don't really know the reference.
*  No, I'm looking at.
*  OK.
*  So what is the story?
*  It's too long to get into.
*  But this is just I'm going to say he is.
*  You should look it up yourself on.
*  There's like a genius.
*  You know, Samuel, this guy, Jimmy, great documentaries.
*  He's the singularity.
*  The thing that Rick Kurzweil would talk about of the in the future when our technology and
*  we merge and whatever.
*  That guy or woman, he's the fucking singularity.
*  That's where it goes.
*  And so all the things you're talking about, singularity of woke, singularity of technology
*  and humanity.
*  It's like this weird autistic, always online fusion that shapes your.
*  But you got to begin with the right clay, which is someone autistic, not being raised
*  right.
*  Right, right.
*  Every phase of it you can watch.
*  And at some point, someone told him that you can't like to some believe.
*  I know I don't know.
*  It sounds crazy.
*  They somebody convinced him you can't be held responsible for your personal actions if you
*  transition because he's doing wild shit over like Sonic's arm color being changed, like
*  really out of control.
*  I can't even you got to just see yourself.
*  And so now I'm just going to cut the end.
*  He ended up raping his senile mother and going to jail.
*  Here's what story ends.
*  It's like an inverse Jesus, like instead of coming out of a virgin, he rapes his senile
*  mother.
*  It's he's the singularity.
*  That's what it is.
*  So they remember they promised, oh, it's going to be amazing.
*  I'm not going to die.
*  Even in Black Mirror, you'll be stored in a hard drive and live a great your best lesbian
*  life.
*  No, that's not what's going to happen.
*  It's going to be this slow, like just a person who is not.
*  They're not all there and they can be conditioned into anything by outside influences.
*  Right.
*  And here's the question.
*  Like what contributing factors are leading to an increase in the amount of people that
*  are autistic?
*  Anime.
*  Starbucks.
*  I got one word.
*  Like, what is it?
*  What are the factors?
*  How much of it is environmental?
*  How much of it is people having kids at an older age?
*  Do you think it's like contribute to it?
*  The Michael Keaton Batman when the Joker talks and, you know, people would die laughing and
*  then Batman figured out it's not the makeup or the shampoo or the something.
*  It's when you use combinations of them.
*  Yeah, it's probably a call.
*  So I guess it's like that.
*  Yeah, it's probably a doctor.
*  It's definitely probably common.
*  But it seems like some medications seem to cause it.
*  And no one wants to say that.
*  And it's fucking bananas to watch people do mental gymnastics for pharmaceutical drug
*  companies just to sort of substantiate and validate their own decisions that they've
*  made.
*  Joe, I know.
*  Instead of just looking at it.
*  In New York, I met three people, three adults that all told me they were the first kid ever
*  to be prescribed Prozac.
*  Three of them.
*  It could be any of them.
*  Yes, they all look like Woody Allen, even the chicks.
*  You know, told me who's on Prozac for the time he's a little kid, Henry Rollins.
*  Really? Yeah, he was just fucking.
*  They had him on Prozac when he was really young.
*  And they I think they kind of cooked him.
*  Oh, that's right. Oh, Riddle.
*  Oh, Riddle. Riddle is more of a speed.
*  Thank you. It's Riddle is basically Adderall.
*  It's it's the same kind of thing.
*  The PhD thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Prozac is you're depressed, right?
*  That's a SSRI or something.
*  I don't think it's an SSRI.
*  It's the one before.
*  It's the one before Paxil, which is not the look apparently to your kid.
*  The Kansas Princess.
*  Leah loved Prozac so much that she wanted to be she wanted to be cremated and then put
*  into an urn that shaped like a Prozac pill.
*  She's being funny.
*  It's funny.
*  It's funny.
*  It's very funny.
*  So selective serotonin re-uptake.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So that's Prozac.
*  That's the term flux flu.
*  Oh, X, the locks of teen locks of teen.
*  So that is Prozac.
*  So it is an SSRI.
*  Why is the Prozac one make people more silly, though?
*  It seems to make people more speedy.
*  It does. Yeah.
*  I know a few people that have been on that one.
*  That one makes you a little speedy.
*  Like where you're like, whoa, what's going on?
*  I don't want to mention names.
*  You know, they say
*  they get a little speedy.
*  But the Ritalin one is like straight up speed.
*  And that's what Rollins was on.
*  Yeah, the kids on it.
*  My friend, I got a friend that is from Georgia.
*  They put it.
*  What? He's a little kid.
*  OK, he was put on 60 milligrams
*  of Adderall a day as like an eight year old.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Do you know how?
*  I mean, that is like so high.
*  That seems so crazy.
*  The panic attacks I've had from very small amounts of Adderall
*  are a little kid.
*  And he like, you know, he's a real aversion
*  to any of that kind of shit because of course, because he's like
*  who's the guy Johnny Depp played?
*  He's like Whitey Bulger.
*  Yeah, they tried out drugs on him and now he hates all drugs.
*  I only like murder.
*  Part of the Harvard LSD studies.
*  Well, yeah, isn't that weird?
*  How all these things?
*  I forgot about that.
*  Whitey Bulger was a part of that.
*  Yeah, all these major people were.
*  It's, you know, you know, they say extraordinary claims.
*  Yeah, need extraordinary evidence.
*  OK, I agree with you.
*  At this point, it would be extraordinary
*  to claim that they're not lying to you all the time.
*  And that thing you're talking about where people don't even want to talk.
*  No, we don't even talk about that.
*  Someone asked for a litter box.
*  Don't you know we're at war and there's a war.
*  So we got to know this is before the war stuff.
*  This is quite but they were just saying I was a liar.
*  Like, look, I didn't lie.
*  I told the story that my friend told me that his wife told him.
*  I did never suspect that it was going to get the reaction that it got, though.
*  You think they look like it got connected to trans stuff.
*  I think they look like New York Times reporters.
*  But it's not it's the thing is, it's like that it got connected was so.
*  I like what are we saying here?
*  We're talking about a person that thinks they're a cat.
*  Are you allowed to do that now?
*  Like, what do you what do you what are we sneaking the door in on?
*  James Lindsay, you know, he's got good videos about
*  because I didn't go to school to learn these important concepts.
*  And so queer theory.
*  Oh, I've seen these.
*  So he has a great thing that explains it.
*  The whole point of it.
*  And you could kind of tell what the deal was.
*  The point of queer theory was not it.
*  It's against being gay or trans.
*  The point of queer theory is to destroy the concept of normal.
*  Right. Expressly in it.
*  We're oppositional to normality.
*  So that's why you're like that's heteronormative.
*  That's why they're saying gynaphiles instead of you're straight.
*  Or like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Ga ga ga. What a downgrade.
*  It is right out of the Orwell playbook to change the definitions,
*  change the words right out of the book.
*  And he didn't write it as a playbook.
*  Everyone is.
*  But everyone's following it.
*  But everyone is just completely pretending that that doesn't exist.
*  Well, just important people with good jobs.
*  Gynaphiles.
*  But you know, files do some men's health.
*  This is a men's health article.
*  There's but gynaphiles.
*  Second, gynaphiles.
*  Wait, there's two. There's two.
*  The majority of the population is a mental illness.
*  Oh, that didn't take long.
*  That didn't take long, didn't.
*  Oh, gynosexual, gynosexual and gynophile.
*  Hilarious. And there's a dispute over what it means.
*  Are you gynophile? Are you fucking fascist?
*  You're crazy. Oh, you know, he was a gynophile.
*  See, there's file on it.
*  Imagine if you got to a point where you weren't supposed to tell someone
*  if you're a guy or girl, you're supposed to figure it out in the bedroom.
*  And it was like a surprise. Like, oh, I hate this. Yeah.
*  This is what a pussy looks like.
*  Someone put an M80 in a cat's asshole.
*  Oh, that too. The fake ones.
*  But you wouldn't have to do that if you just keep your dick.
*  If you could keep your dick and still be 100 percent a woman,
*  I think we'd have less of those surgeries.
*  We can might be the best way to stop those surgeries
*  because that can stop you from orgasming.
*  So I know I have two friends that have transition.
*  But back in the day, my friend in Art Institute,
*  because they're going to cut your dick off.
*  And my friend was like, no, most most trans do not do that
*  because exactly what you just said. Yeah, it's new.
*  This is new where you get the bottom surgery, which I got to warn everybody.
*  They haven't perfected it yet.
*  If you want to not know some shit,
*  you think a cat litter box at schools are disturbing request to know about.
*  Look up the maintenance of that shit
*  and maybe just think about keeping the dick like the classic trans way.
*  This is an autistic thing. Yeah.
*  You've had people on explaining it. Yeah.
*  And so that's right.
*  And it's the farmer.
*  Dude, never mind people's sexuality.
*  Besides that, queer theory bullshit.
*  It's it's surgery and like the ethics of plastic surgeons,
*  like what they did to Michael Jackson, Madonna's faces.
*  Yeah. Imagine that on your kid's dick.
*  Exactly. Or their tits.
*  And they're not going to think your kids any differently than they think
*  of some lady who's getting their six nose job. Yeah.
*  They don't. Yes. And they.
*  Yes. And another one.
*  We need that. We're not going to wait.
*  We're not going to wait until you go to puberty.
*  They got the ethics of it.
*  I don't want you going to puberty.
*  Like we don't want.
*  There's no evidence.
*  Fuck do you know? You don't even know this kid.
*  We'll find out.
*  The whole thing is so insane.
*  And when the lawsuits start rolling in,
*  that's like one of the things is interesting.
*  It's like New York Times started writing articles about D
*  transitioners. That's right.
*  And that's when it's getting serious, when these people feel like they have
*  to step up and make articles about the transitioners.
*  That's running a sinking ship.
*  That's the rats fleeing the sinking ship.
*  I never said you should do that.
*  Someone online, I forget who it was, commented on Twitter.
*  This is because the trial lawyers are now getting involved. Finally.
*  Yeah. But that's probably the only thing it's going to take.
*  Also, their kids got, you know, like that one shift in New York Times,
*  her kids developmentally slowed from masking.
*  And she was a big time shut up.
*  Shut up. She was a big Xi Jinping about it.
*  Li Nguyen. Is that what you're talking about?
*  Yeah. And then she goes, oh, it affected you.
*  Like when Dick Cheney realized that lesbianism is cool
*  because he had a lesbian daughter.
*  Oh, but not only that.
*  Then she started talking about how there's real evidence
*  that most of the people that died and that they were called
*  COVID deaths are not from COVID.
*  Yeah. Yeah. We knew that a long time ago.
*  But she was talking about it on CNN.
*  They were like, what are you saying?
*  She was I estimate the death to be about 30 percent
*  of what the reported death rate is.
*  Like you're supposed to have had at this point,
*  if you're following the science and not doing your 10 shots by now.
*  Is it 10? It's up.
*  It was eight when I was making fun of this months ago.
*  And now it's 10.
*  Imagine if you really updated.
*  How many people are actually up to bring them in here?
*  They're probably teeth are falling out.
*  The eyes are glowing.
*  Do you how much time do you have?
*  Oh, do you have track marks from vaccine?
*  You have like literal pink eye.
*  You're fucking hemorrhaging inside your eyeballs.
*  How many shots if you're current with your COVID vaccine,
*  how many shots would you have received if you started getting them in?
*  What was it? July of 2020?
*  Good luck with that search.
*  Whatever fucking year was was it 2021?
*  When they start rolling them out?
*  Not soon enough. It wasn't 2020.
*  You didn't need to take all that time with the testing.
*  We will try it.
*  Well, the the best one was the one that they released,
*  the bivalent ones where they didn't have any human testing.
*  Well, I guess they actually did, didn't they?
*  In the long. Yeah.
*  Turns out it doesn't work at all.
*  Not only does it not work at all, it actually works worse.
*  Well, good thing you can't sue.
*  Yeah. Hey, good thing you can't sue the one drug.
*  They're probably more honest because you can't sue.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Well, weird that you can just like lie to people
*  and you could force people to take things and you could hide the side effects
*  and you can't sue them.
*  That seems I don't want to say it seems corrupt because that seems like.
*  That would be wrong.
*  Why? You'd be way the fuck out of line.
*  Yeah, that's like saying there's somebody asked for a litter box
*  at their kids school. Yeah, that's not a line.
*  Shut up.
*  So on. It's not a lot.
*  There's no way they would do that to you over and over and over
*  and over and over and over and over again.
*  And you keep falling for it like fucking Charlie Brown
*  going for that football with Lucy.
*  I'm not smart. I'm that Charlie Brown stupid.
*  How do you still take the kick now at this point?
*  God damn it. You tackle Lucy.
*  Like I don't take her out.
*  What are you going to do?
*  What Allah commanded us to do?
*  Allah does not allow Lucy to play games with you.
*  You're supposed to be able to beat her.
*  You look at her with her uncovered hair, pull a man's football.
*  Allah is a sign of the fucking feminism rise
*  or rather Lucy is a sign of the feminism rise.
*  Allah does not want that.
*  Well, if Lucy is like dominating Charlie Brown, Allah would not.
*  I think Allah just wants balance.
*  For sure. But he definitely wouldn't want Lucy kicking Charlie Brown's ass.
*  I mean, that would be get the fuck out here with that.
*  This bitch needs to be put in her place.
*  What was Charlie Brown's crimes, though, had he?
*  Depends what he had done. Good point.
*  Charlie Brown was an infidel.
*  So that might be like the worst punishment we have for you.
*  Humiliated by a woman.
*  Maybe it's perfect.
*  A woman's going to laugh at your dick.
*  Maybe it's perfect.
*  It's just I just I'm concerned that it seems like all this stuff is accelerating
*  to some sort of a boiling point. Do you love it?
*  You want to know why? Why?
*  Because my girlfriend's like 10 or 12 years younger than me.
*  So she sounds like hopes and shit.
*  I got it.
*  Like, but now that the ball when the bombs hit, like,
*  I I did drugs and drank and smoked for these healthy motherfuckers.
*  Like you do die right with me.
*  Oh, did you try to extend your life?
*  We're all going together.
*  I barely wore a condom.
*  That's what you're happy about that you live up.
*  So it's fine. It's in fact, if it doesn't end, I'll be like, oh, shit,
*  I should have handled my life better.
*  Well, there's a lot of people that live like that, right?
*  If the apocalypse never comes like shit, all these preppers
*  were going to spend all my time cannon peaches and shit.
*  No, that's they're going to be the be nice to them because pretty soon.
*  Yeah, they'd be the only ones.
*  They're going to be the people that have like the ability
*  to generate power with the sun.
*  Yeah, they figured out like zero point energy in their backyard
*  while you're thinking around string theory.
*  People don't understand like powers only do so good if society goes down
*  because there'll be no more communication.
*  That's the that's the great
*  like what we're are now is we're electronically connected to everybody.
*  So you know how to get places.
*  You know what's going on.
*  You know the news, you know the weather, you know the fucking highways.
*  You got a map. I think I do.
*  Yes. You're just if you're if you have a cell phone that works
*  and you're in a car and you are traveling in this country,
*  you have an incredible resource.
*  And then all of a sudden that's gone and you don't know where the fuck you are.
*  And no one has a map.
*  And no one knows how to read a map, even if you fucking had it.
*  And now all of a sudden the world is a mystery again,
*  just like it was in the 1800s.
*  The world's a mystery.
*  Everything over that hill is who knows, it could be hostile Indians.
*  I feel like it's like I feel like it's like that with all of the stuff.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  What in the fuck can you trust every time I find out a new thing?
*  I'm like I have to have like a period of PTSD time. Right.
*  There's a possibility of finding out.
*  My point is, if all that shit goes down, it's not going to matter
*  if you have power because you're not going to have any communication.
*  All it's going to be gone.
*  Everyone within one generation is going to be a fucking moron again.
*  No one's going to have any idea of what they're going to have stories
*  about what society used to be like.
*  Yeah. And then look, we have stories now from my generation
*  of what it was like growing up with an answering machine.
*  We had an answering machine.
*  People would call and leave a message.
*  It was crazy. And you could call your own house and listen to the message.
*  And a pager.
*  I had a pager. What is it? The Old West?
*  I had a pager. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Joey Diaz had a pager forever.
*  Like before he like he got a phone later than anybody.
*  Dude, do you play a I play Jimmy had a show in Palm Springs.
*  But it was like a movie theater.
*  You know, movie theaters will have. Yeah.
*  I got caught up. I'm in there.
*  And I'm like, wow, this is like what after the apocalypse,
*  this is what this will be used for.
*  The place with the old movies will just be a guy.
*  Until and then.
*  Yeah, with a solar powered.
*  It felt like I was at the like, oh, we have the apocalypse
*  and this is how we're getting by.
*  Dude, you got to realize, like before Google, before Internet searching,
*  you had to take people's word for shit.
*  You know, you people would just tell you things.
*  You like what happened?
*  Like, imagine you with your conspiracies, but existing pre-internet.
*  I like you don't even know what happened to Haiti.
*  Do you know what we did in Haiti?
*  Like everybody like what this fucking Kurt's crazy.
*  You know, it's fucking sad, dude, like, first of all,
*  we haven't even gotten to my conspiracies.
*  Like my conspiracies. What's the big one?
*  That my biggest one? Yeah.
*  100 percent believe Eric, the dude for the Raytheon thing
*  that whistleblower that came out during the little tiddy peak of UFOs
*  we had over the over the summer when they were like, you know,
*  that they announced UFOs are real. Right.
*  Which is fucking crazy, by the way. Right.
*  And I mean, I know you would give a shit or like friends would.
*  It's not enough information.
*  It's it's really annoying the amount of teasing of it.
*  But meanwhile, the Titanic submarine imploded around the same time.
*  Everybody knew that. You know, it's a distraction.
*  You know, that's horseshit for nerds.
*  A distractions, the Titanic submarine story or putting a butter
*  deck on the Bud Light can.
*  That's a quality America distraction. OK.
*  Like this stuff, they got you
*  just like Haiti, Haiti, UFOs, you program.
*  Not to get going all over the place. Raytheon UFO.
*  That's what I asked you about. What are you talking about?
*  Raytheon, dude, I was texting you about which one Eric Hacker,
*  the guy that came out in the Raytheon that said in Antarctica.
*  Right. You got to tell people what the fuck you're talking about.
*  I'm sorry. People that are listening have no idea what you're talking about.
*  I thought this is just that we're hanging out and not doing a show.
*  It's OK. I'm just trying to get someone's
*  going to flip it.
*  So this guy is the this is the guy that was on the Sean Ryan show.
*  Right. Yes. Yes.
*  So he's talking about how he was a I guess he was a fireman out there.
*  And yeah, yeah, he was in Alaska.
*  And he was saying there's direct energy weapons, you know, about so.
*  Oh, you have a lot of physicists on the show.
*  So I follow a lot of that.
*  And so I knew about the ice cube neutrino detector just from following
*  science channels because without any of this, let's listen to what he says,
*  because it sounds so kooky.
*  Are we allowed to the whole podcast?
*  I got to find the prime.
*  I'm looking for the clip. I think.
*  Oh, that was a whole podcast. Yeah, I think. OK.
*  But anyway, it's interesting because I'm listening to the guy talk.
*  There's a tick tock video.
*  Well, this is still four minutes long.
*  OK, but just give us a little something.
*  Third party contractor for the National Science Foundation.
*  I function in a dual role capacity as tradesman and a firefighter.
*  My responsibilities required me to be more informed than most of my crew
*  and offered me complete access to the facilities.
*  What I learned from this unique experience needs to be shared
*  with the entire world.
*  The technology at the South Pole Station certainly can do
*  what it is presented as its primary purposes and unfortunately, much more.
*  The ice cube neutrino detector is presented as a passive
*  listening device for the purposes of the science as presented.
*  But I'm going to skip right through the chase, folks.
*  I have provided documentation that proves that the five thousand one hundred
*  and sixty, what they call doms that are embedded in the ice
*  can actually transmit at two thousand and forty seven volts each.
*  That gives us a long list of things to consider.
*  It is effectively a multifaceted directed energy weapons platform
*  that I will list rapidly a few things that it can do.
*  Vehicle detection, we're learning that these off world craft,
*  on world craft, ours or other nations are also emitting neutrinos.
*  So this makes the South Pole Station effectively an air traffic control station
*  for this new level of equipment that nobody's discussing.
*  In addition to the ability to detect neutrinos and the exotic vehicles,
*  I provide a documentation that shows that this is also a system
*  for faster than light communications.
*  In the past, Gary McKinnon has hacked NASA, found the off world fleet,
*  the list of captains, and it's apparent that if we have faster than light
*  vehicles moving throughout the system, we're going to need faster than light
*  communications. This is that facility.
*  Unfortunately, I have other bad news.
*  The season that I was there, 2010 to 2011, we converted from
*  construction to operations and maintenance in both the elevated station
*  and the detector array.
*  Unfortunately, when they first fired it up, that was when we had the
*  earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand.
*  There was two incidental shots before they were able to target it correctly.
*  This is an earthquake generating device as well.
*  This is the weapons of war that we have to deal with now and what Raytheon's
*  hiding.
*  No.
*  Remember Havana syndrome?
*  But don't...
*  So if it's a neutrino detector and a neutrino projector, don't neutrino...
*  No, they're not projecting them.
*  No.
*  What is it projecting then?
*  If it's going...
*  Extreme frequencies, so like ELF and all that shit.
*  Okay.
*  So it detects neutrinos and then it projects something else.
*  So it has a different thing it does.
*  This can be used for many applications.
*  So the detector detects neutrinos.
*  That kind of makes sense.
*  Like, why would you give a fuck about...
*  But here's the question.
*  Like, why would you give a fuck, spend so much money to detect neutrinos in
*  space?
*  But if you say, oh, well, these UFOs emit neutrinos, like, oh, and you can
*  eventually use them because otherwise you have to be able to track something
*  that instantaneously appears and disappears.
*  Air traffic control for UFOs makes sense.
*  The legit, when I watched about Ice Cube, when it first came out, nothing with
*  this, the reason it caught my interest was, but for some reason there's
*  neutrinos that are coming out of the earth and not from space.
*  So then, so I'll remember these little details and every day is like God damn
*  Kaiser Soze, I figured out.
*  I'm just sitting there...
*  I thought neutrinos just go right through everything.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  Look, I don't know how that would be...
*  When a neutrino interacts with the Antarctic ice, it creates other particles.
*  In this event graphic, a muon was created that traveled through the detector
*  almost at the speed of light.
*  The pattern, the amount of light recorded by the Ice Cube sensors indicate
*  the particles direction and energy.
*  Wow.
*  So I get how you'd be interested in like finding out like the rays from space
*  and what's going on, but also if they're got a dual purpose and you actually know
*  that this can detect whatever the fuck these things are, what do you think those
*  things are and what do you think that...
*  What it's detecting?
*  No, the UAPs, UFOs.
*  Do you think that a lot of them are ours?
*  Yeah.
*  A lot of them, right?
*  I'm sure a lot of them are ours.
*  But maybe some of them aren't.
*  Where will we get that technology from?
*  Right.
*  Where will we get that?
*  Right.
*  Because the, that, you know, but the tic tac thing is so boring, but it's a
*  fascinating topic.
*  Those things appearing back in the fifties that we didn't invent that in the fucking
*  whatever, whenever they first saw them, we didn't invent that back then.
*  The thing is like when you have that guy that first started calling them flying
*  saucers because they were skipping across the sky, like no one had that technology
*  back then.
*  No one had the technology to fly something at insane rates of speed, incredible
*  maneuverability that's shaped like a disc that didn't exist.
*  So at some point in time, it wasn't ours because we had propeller planes.
*  The idea that we had these weapons of war and our weapons of war were propeller
*  planes and we would open up the bottom of it.
*  It's basically like a reverse convertible and just drop a bomb out of it.
*  That's what they can look down.
*  You could literally, you go, dwee, you would just like figure out, drop it now.
*  Wee.
*  Boom.
*  We just save a bunch of Nazis just to figure out how to get beyond that, you
*  know?
*  But let's say it's a, no, they didn't find, like, let's say they did find
*  something that wasn't us.
*  Do you think they'd tell you about it?
*  Or do you think they'd hide it for, I don't know, 80 years?
*  Like the JFK files are 60 years.
*  You see what Trump said about the JFK files?
*  No, what?
*  He was talking to, what's that guy's name?
*  Napolitano.
*  Oh yeah, yeah.
*  And he said, he goes, why did you break that promise?
*  Yeah, why?
*  And he goes, if they showed you what they showed me, you wouldn't tell anybody either.
*  I didn't see that.
*  That's what Trump said.
*  Yeah.
*  I didn't see that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what Trump said to that judge.
*  If, I think there's, there's only one reason to hide it.
*  The CIA killed Kennedy.
*  You know, shit.
*  There's only one reason and probably not just the CIA, probably the mob, probably a
*  bunch of people, probably a lot of motive.
*  There are a lot of people wanted him gone.
*  They, they were, they did not like him in Dallas when he came to Dallas.
*  Like Dallas was a red state in a red city in a red state and they did not like him.
*  He wasn't liked by everybody.
*  This idea that he's liked by everybody.
*  That's now that he's murdered.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Everybody loves you after you get murdered.
*  Right.
*  And if, can you imagine if Obama got murdered, how much they would love him
*  now?
*  Oh my God.
*  We were looking, we were looking at Trump and then Biden is fucking bumbling old
*  dead man.
*  Yeah.
*  We'd look back at the days when our president was like well spoken and we'd be so
*  pumped.
*  This is a silly place.
*  We live in a silly place.
*  It's the silliest place.
*  Uh, yeah, well, I didn't, that's a crazy thing.
*  I didn't know he said that.
*  Like I, I, I'm gonna go find that clip.
*  That's what he said.
*  Um, and that doesn't that read, doesn't that register?
*  Like it has to be something that's so egregious that you would realize.
*  Like this would throw the whole country into disarray.
*  We would completely lose trust in what I think is necessary.
*  I think the CIA is necessary.
*  I just think they're out of control.
*  I think the FBI is necessary.
*  I just think you're not supposed to fucking do some of the shit.
*  How many people did you have in the fucking ground on January 6th?
*  Tell us that.
*  No, I can't.
*  But I think for legitimate crimes and like dangerous fucking terrorists, that shit's
*  important because sleeper cells are fucking real.
*  Like they knew that something was going down in Russia and they tried to tell them,
*  they tried to warn them, stay away from any mass gatherings.
*  The United States, the United States intelligence agencies were aware that
*  something was going down in Russia.
*  Yeah, I'm sure they were aware.
*  I'm sure they warned them.
*  Yeah, they did.
*  I'm sure that's what that was.
*  But listen, the point is that can serve a function.
*  You do need some sort like, like this guy from the CIA was on Schultz's podcast.
*  Yeah, I don't like that guy.
*  Wait, his hair?
*  What is it?
*  He's the cool CIA guy.
*  For?
*  Okay.
*  I just had the hair.
*  All right away.
*  I'm like, what are you doing?
*  Yeah, he looks like he's from old school.
*  He's the, he's the Dominican kid from old school, the young one with that same
*  hair and the fucking, but I'm watching him on a leck.
*  I think it was Lex.
*  Lex Friedman.
*  Yeah, it was Lex first.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, and he goes, and he goes, yeah, you know, they all tell you this great story
*  of how they look for people who are sociopaths and he goes, they don't like
*  me to say this, but I feel more comfortable around gangsters and something.
*  I'm like, so here's, I'm naive, as I said, and I go, well, I know why they don't
*  want you to say that because it sounds like you're a criminal, like a gangster,
*  but that's not why it's so he looks cool for the kids because they're recruiting.
*  It's recruiting season all the time.
*  It's the, Ooh, I'm a cool grand theft auto.
*  And look at my dumb fucking hair.
*  That's what the fuck that is.
*  I don't know what you got mad.
*  Look at you.
*  Because that thing of warning them, dude, the spin of that story.
*  Let me get to what I'm saying.
*  Yeah.
*  So what he was saying was there's sleeper cells in like Chinese communities.
*  And, um, one of the guys, I forget which guy on Schultz's show brought that up.
*  And he asked him and then he was like, yes, it's true.
*  And they're like, what?
*  He's right.
*  This is real.
*  And that Chinese nationals will embed themselves in these like ex-pat cultures.
*  Well, they're not experts.
*  They're, they're, they're, it's a Chinese.
*  What is it called when you have a, he explained it on the podcast.
*  What's it called when you have a culture that is essentially, they only speak
*  Chinese, they hang out with only Chinese people, they're in a Chinese village.
*  That's inside of a city.
*  Oh, right.
*  There's a term for it, but there's a term for that.
*  And he was saying that in that, like, we would do that if there was something like
*  that, that existed in a foreign country, of course we would do that.
*  We embed our intelligence agents into that country.
*  It's a responsibility.
*  That's the only way you find out what the fuck is going on.
*  So of course China's doing that.
*  Oh, you don't think they're coming at us with a balloons?
*  They're doing that too.
*  I don't believe for two seconds.
*  I think they're doing that too.
*  I think they're doing that right.
*  Well, the crazy one, drones.
*  Did you hear about the drones at the bases that were happening for weeks?
*  No, I sent it to you the other day.
*  Jamie, do you have it?
*  Do you want me to send it to you again?
*  Um, this is something, uh, Melissa Chen sent me.
*  Uh, there's apparently a fucking shit ton of drones that were hanging around this
*  base for weeks and they didn't know who would look at this mysterious drone
*  swarmed Langley Air Force base for weeks, dude, weeks.
*  The unidentified drones were such an issue that assets were called in from, uh,
*  around the government, including a NASA WB 57 high altitude jet.
*  So they're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on.
*  If we're at some weird stage where they start implementing these things that
*  we've been calling UFOs that maybe at least some of them are controlled by
*  someone that's a human being.
*  I think many of them are.
*  Yeah.
*  But if they're that level where they can just like buzz around Air Force bases
*  and no one can catch them and no one can stop them and no one knows what the fuck
*  they are.
*  Um, first of all, you know, Raytheon is a weapons company that's in Antarctica.
*  They're just to make concern for science.
*  Yes.
*  They're just concerned for science.
*  Listen, this is a neutrino detector, which is really important.
*  As someone who loves science and talking to scientists, I support Raytheon's
*  desire to not just create weapons, but also do well for humanity.
*  Touche, sir.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And I support their getting young women into STEM fields.
*  Yes.
*  I support that.
*  And I caught Rachel Maddow's speaking engagement there about how we need to
*  shovel more and more science into the future.
*  Shovel money into Ukraine.
*  And I accepted and believe it.
*  And that's right.
*  Ukraine.
*  What a conspiracy to say that wasn't going to work out.
*  What a crazy conspiracy to say they haven't been winning.
*  They would be better off.
*  They would have more if we didn't do fucking anything.
*  They'd be way better off than they are now, which is fucked.
*  Dude, I want to do a reality show with Conor McGregor and Zelensky just doing
*  coke together in a mansion.
*  Zelensky is going to try to fuck Conor.
*  It's going to not work out.
*  So this is going to try to suck his dick.
*  It's going to make it go hit him.
*  Oh, kill him.
*  Just one little thing.
*  Like the Haiti shit.
*  Like, like a lot of people say, if you bring up anything with Haiti, like, oh,
*  this conspiracy, that's the saddest fucking shit in the world.
*  There's no conspiracy about it.
*  It's all shit.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  That's again.
*  Don't tell me how bad Putin is after what you guys did to fucking Haiti the whole
*  time.
*  Well, they were so mad at Tucker for going and talking to Putin and making him a
*  human.
*  People were so mad.
*  OK.
*  Well, shouldn't you at least if you want to decipher what they're saying, shouldn't
*  you at least listen to what the enemy, supposed enemy, whatever it is, the leader
*  of this country that's invading Ukraine has to say?
*  Shouldn't you want to listen to what he has to say?
*  Even if what he's saying is a lie, you should be able to have experts analyze what
*  he's saying and say, this is not factual.
*  This is the true reason why he attacked the NATO intrusion into specified areas
*  that they had forbidden.
*  That's not true.
*  And here's how we can show that.
*  Yeah, but they don't want to hear what he has to say.
*  OK, so I'll be the fucking dipshit from CNN or whatever.
*  Yeah.
*  But a qualified person should middleman this information and do like, you know how
*  we want Twitter to censor more?
*  Not some jerk like Tucker Carlson.
*  It should be Christiane Amambour.
*  Yeah.
*  And then it gets filtered.
*  Oh, that's a great point.
*  Yes.
*  I'm sorry.
*  That's a number.
*  Don Lemon should be the one talking.
*  Yes.
*  And then they should go over it before you see what Putin had to say.
*  Don't give him a platform.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Don't platform him.
*  You imagine sending Don Lemon to talk to Putin.
*  I was thinking about it.
*  That I'm into it.
*  Be wonderful.
*  If Elon's listening, Elon.
*  Do you imagine if Don Lemon could talk to Putin in Russian so he could badger him the
*  way he badgered Elon?
*  I can't imagine Russian.
*  I can imagine him doing the same interview he did with Elon Musk.
*  Yes.
*  To Putin.
*  Exactly.
*  And I would love to see that.
*  Well, if they did it over Google Translate so that they could do it like when them
*  Samsung phones.
*  So they could translate it.
*  You know, have you seen those Samsung phones that translate it instantaneously?
*  The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is this fucking amazing new phone that has AI built into
*  it that allows you to translate things in real time.
*  So if you have a Galaxy earbuds in and you're listening to someone talk in German, it'll
*  translate it into English in your fucking ear in real time.
*  And it also translate on an app where one side of the screen, the screens cut in half,
*  one side of the screen is facing you, the other side is facing me.
*  You speak to me in Farsi.
*  It translates it to English and in writing.
*  And then I speak in English and translates it into Farsi.
*  Question, is it better than Google Translate's job of translating other languages?
*  I think it's a little more sophisticated because it's built into the phone and it's
*  built, it's an AI feature that's built into the operating system.
*  It's like they're the first company, Samsung and this phone in particular, is the first
*  company to not just use AI for photos because it uses AI for photos as well, but it also
*  uses AI to make like a synopsis of a website.
*  So if you go to a website and you say, give me a summary of what this website is saying,
*  it'll break it down in bullet points for you.
*  Like the web and it will do that with your notes.
*  So if you have notes, so you read a bunch of crazy shit and Samsung notes, my manifesto,
*  exactly.
*  Or your set list and you say, hey, summarize this.
*  It'll summarize it.
*  It'll break it into paragraphs, parts that fit together and things that make sense.
*  Oh, I'm curious to try it out.
*  They're what my point is, they're getting to a point where Don Lemon really could have a
*  fucking conversation with Putin in real time if they could do that Russian to English,
*  English to Russian.
*  And as long as there's someone there that stops World War Three, as long as there's
*  someone there that like like a no, they misinterpreted that word.
*  That word means this, which means the opposite of that.
*  It's a you know, it fucked up.
*  The AI didn't catch it right.
*  The last translation I tried to read was, that's why I bring it up is, of course, now
*  here's my number one conspiracy I'm emotionally attached to is President Macron's wife is
*  a trans woman.
*  My favorite. I have to pee.
*  Let's come back and talk about that.
*  I got to pee too.
*  Yeah, that's my favorite.
*  We'll be right back.
*  Maybe you can become white.
*  Sammy Sosa is becoming white.
*  No one cares.
*  I thought he achieved it.
*  He's basically more white than I am.
*  That's I used to have a whole bit about penis whitening about Sammy Sosa.
*  He's white.
*  Yeah, they do by laser.
*  Do they really?
*  In Thailand, it was like they lighten your penis.
*  I hope it's not as big as it used to.
*  Yeah.
*  Move over asshole whitening.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah, that seems they heard that's the best part of being white, the dick of it.
*  And they were like, they want it.
*  They do it by laser, dude.
*  The great white whale.
*  Everybody wants a Moby Dick.
*  The great white whale.
*  Oh, um.
*  That's not it.
*  White Yeti Dick.
*  Imagine if like one of the blackest dick porn stars with those giant 14 inch dicks.
*  One of those guys just decided to just whiten it up, whiten up the whole dick.
*  You know what that would be like?
*  14 inch dick white would be crazy.
*  If he did that.
*  Okay.
*  Yes, it would be.
*  Who's that singer that she lost weight and everybody got really mad at her like she
*  betrayed.
*  It would be like the turning of turning on Adele.
*  Like you whiten a 14 inch dick on black history.
*  How dare you?
*  How dare you?
*  How dare you?
*  That would be like a cry.
*  I bet you'd be a lot of backlash if I'm like, no, I just think it looks better.
*  And I'm he sells the thing is wild.
*  He just looks so good when he's skin was darker.
*  Like, I don't understand.
*  He looks so weird now.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, Hey, you know who looks good?
*  McCrone's wife.
*  Yes, that's what we're talking about.
*  So, so this story, even if McCrone's wife is like Candace Owens was fired, Candace
*  Owens alleges that McCrone's wife is somehow or another a biological man who transitioned
*  at age 30 to become a woman.
*  Even if that's not true.
*  McCrone's wife was 39.
*  No older.
*  When he was 15.
*  I think that's the age.
*  He was probably 14, not 15 by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  So remember Mary Kay Letourneau and the Hawaiian kid or the smoke kid.
*  Yeah.
*  Like I found a picture of them.
*  Like, so imagine that story, right?
*  Where she went to prison, you know, for rape, right?
*  And then came out and married him and they had three kids and got a divorce.
*  Imagine if instead of that, they ruled France.
*  That's where it ended up.
*  Right.
*  And now that's the less crazy of the story.
*  Well, it's not, but yes, that's the less crazy somehow, but it's the less crazy
*  because the crazy version of stories that it's actually a man.
*  That's the unacceptable part.
*  That's the part where they're going to sue.
*  How dare you say that our underage fucking rape marriage that is the president's wife
*  is the president and first lady of France.
*  Right.
*  Don't don't add crazy shit to this.
*  Yeah, don't make don't make her trans.
*  Like asshole.
*  This is the part that I love about the clown world Armageddon happening is the
*  priorities are so cocked up in everyone's head because of changing markets.
*  I guess I don't know what the fuck it is.
*  And the Antarctica beam, the clown beam in Antarctica that has clearly been
*  turned on is Eric Assuted.
*  That is dude.
*  That's the first thing when I heard I'm like, wait, that's that's the least
*  bat shit part of the story is that there's a transfer.
*  First lady is the most.
*  But it's crazy because it's been hidden for so long.
*  But the most bat shit part is evidently true, which is, yeah, she was 39 and he
*  was 15 if it's if we're being fair, the age changes.
*  Look at this.
*  Okay, here it goes.
*  It was the after school drama club of Lasi.
*  How do you say Lasi?
*  La Provence that she and Emmanuel Macron first met.
*  She was in charge of the after school theater club that he attended when he was
*  15 alongside her daughter, Lawrence, who was in his class.
*  Cool.
*  Their relationship has attracted controversy as she is his senior by close to 25 years.
*  And Macron described her as a love often clandestine, often hidden, misunderstood
*  by many before imposing itself.
*  Oh, that's a very French way to talk about it.
*  Well, well, go back to that.
*  Don't go away.
*  Look how crazy that statement is.
*  I love often clandestine, often hidden, misunderstood by many before imposing
*  itself.
*  Well, you were getting molested in 89.
*  That's exactly what that is.
*  Yeah, this is so crazy.
*  In 89, Brigitte Macron, then with her, how do you ever say her maiden name,
*  Esosier, unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the city council of Tucktersheim.
*  It was the only time she ran for office.
*  In 2017, Brigitte Macron Macron played an active role in her husband's
*  presidential campaign.
*  A top advisor was quoted as saying that her presence is essential for him.
*  During this campaign, Emmanuel Macron stated upon his winning of the French
*  presidency, his wife would have the role that she always had with him.
*  She will not be hidden.
*  Not translating.
*  Why would you hide your wife?
*  Yeah, why would you?
*  He proposed creating an official first lady title as the spouse of the French
*  president currently holds no official title, coming with her own staff office
*  and a personally allocated budget for their activities.
*  Following Macron's election as president and his previously outspoken stance
*  against nepotism, a petition against his proposal was gathered more than 275,000
*  signatures and the French government announced that Brigitte Macron would not
*  hold the office title of first lady and would not be allocated an official
*  budget.
*  So they pushed back.
*  So just the real facts of 39, 15, often clandestine, often hidden, but eventually
*  imposing itself like what?
*  She was married with three kids and raped a student.
*  Yeah.
*  And now here's the thing.
*  Did the three kids come from her penis or did the three kids come from her
*  vagina?
*  So if they didn't come from her penis, that means that she gave birth to them,
*  which makes sense.
*  But if they came from her penis, if this is what Candice is saying, who gave birth
*  to those kids?
*  If those are her kids.
*  She was the father of the kids.
*  I know the woman.
*  I don't even know where's the mom.
*  So that should be easiest.
*  Like this is the actual mom.
*  This is the person that you were married to and you had kids with before you
*  became a woman.
*  That should be a person you could find.
*  I've that's I've not heard that though.
*  There's one picture.
*  You're saying that she's definitely a man.
*  No, I'm not saying you are, but if someone is saying that, I'm not saying you
*  are.
*  Yeah, I know you don't have a dog in this fight, but if someone is saying that
*  Macron is actually a man that you have to like who if she has kids and these are
*  her kids.
*  So you have to find who had the fucking kids with her.
*  You're saying she's a man.
*  That's a big question.
*  Where'd that woman go?
*  She vanished.
*  She should still be alive.
*  If Macron's alive, the woman she had kids with probably also alive.
*  The kids know that that's not their mom.
*  What are we doing?
*  Okay.
*  No, look, those are all valid questions.
*  But I can't find the video more on YouTube.
*  She had a link to the this is how we got on this topic was that there's a link to
*  the all the compiled evidence over the years.
*  Okay.
*  And where's the woman that made the babies?
*  Well, they were like, where's the husband that she had?
*  They were like, they can't.
*  They there's one picture got released.
*  They sued about it.
*  But there were no pictures of her for the first 30 years, except as 70.
*  There's not a lot of pictures of me.
*  And I'm 56 from your first 30 years of life.
*  There's a few.
*  But until cell phones came, well, I was also on television.
*  Right.
*  So I was also a comedian.
*  So there's more pictures and photos and videos of me than would be normally with
*  most people.
*  Like, but the pictures of me from the time I was young, there's only like a
*  fucking handful.
*  You know what?
*  I guess wealthy French people didn't take pictures.
*  But it's also it's like a different time.
*  She's 70 years old.
*  Like they had to do a photograph like stand there.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's like there's not a lot of photos.
*  They weren't digitally.
*  If they weren't like people's words, the photos of Michelle Obama pregnant, like
*  probably in her fucking photo album.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  What is what?
*  What?
*  Why would she put them online?
*  That's a crazy one to bring up.
*  That's another one.
*  That one was like the first ridiculous one.
*  The big Mike one, which led to this McCrone one, which seems to have
*  no legs.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  McCrone one.
*  Yes.
*  Few years.
*  Yes.
*  The McCrone's older.
*  I want.
*  Okay.
*  I should say in this country, I haven't heard about it.
*  I haven't heard in France.
*  They've been talking about since how long?
*  How many years?
*  At least three.
*  This has been lawsuits.
*  There's been all sorts of.
*  Yeah, it's, it's.
*  Didn't just start like well, then big Mike was going on a long time ago too, though.
*  I didn't say it wasn't.
*  But you said this was going on before big Mike.
*  I said it.
*  You said this is new.
*  I did the misinformation.
*  But I think big Mike was probably first though.
*  No, wasn't that like, didn't be like, listen, Joan Rivers said that Michelle
*  Obama was a man before she died.
*  When was that?
*  Was that a joke?
*  I thought it was a joke.
*  I thought it was a joke too, but the way she said it wasn't like jokey.
*  She was like, walk out.
*  Come on.
*  Everybody knows Michelle Obama's the man.
*  Remember that?
*  Yeah.
*  Like would big Mike kill you for that?
*  Well, I think she died because she had a thousand plastic surgeries, but.
*  She was going under.
*  Yeah.
*  She sees these big black arms coming over.
*  Bro.
*  Oh no.
*  Whoever did Madonna's face was working on Joan Rivers first and perfecting the craft.
*  The face killer.
*  The, go to see if you can find Joan Rivers saying Michelle Obama's a man.
*  The video.
*  No, I don't.
*  My darling.
*  I would just hold it, mister.
*  I was given a boarding pass with the wrong name on it.
*  I went through five different security passes and then a woman at the gate who
*  will not look at my passport, who will not call continental, who will not call
*  the help, who will not recheck into their records says to me, you cannot go on.
*  No, she is a moron.
*  What?
*  What?
*  That had nothing to do with that.
*  Jamie.
*  Look what the title says.
*  I know.
*  But, but that's not it.
*  Um, if you go to it, that's not, that's the wrong video.
*  It's absolutely the wrong video.
*  Why would they hold on Jamie, Jamie, there's a video of her and she's
*  walking into her apartment building.
*  Right here.
*  I just, okay.
*  That's it.
*  This is the one.
*  So let's just calm down.
*  Got it.
*  No, Michelle is a trans.
*  She's a what?
*  A transgender.
*  We all know.
*  Oh my gosh.
*  Pretty funny how she said it.
*  Okay.
*  We all know it.
*  So what year was that?
*  Jamie, that she said that.
*  I have no idea.
*  Well, let's see if we can find that.
*  Well, how soon before she died, did she say it?
*  Well, and Boeing is a terrible airline.
*  Zelinski is a coke.
*  And Zelinski does coke.
*  And Israel's committing genocide.
*  Well, all the, all the, you know, all the questions you said right at the top about
*  like, so where's the woman, there's a lot of math of like for this to work out.
*  Well, let's ask this.
*  This is how we can find out when, when did she die?
*  2014.
*  Okay.
*  So it was 2014.
*  So it was 2014 that she did that where she 2014.
*  So it had to be before 2014, cause she was dead at 2014.
*  So 2014 or before she said Michelle Obama is a man.
*  So this is like 10 years.
*  Have you ever heard that before her?
*  I did.
*  I never heard it.
*  No, I didn't.
*  I didn't even hear her say that until years later, after she was dead.
*  The Obama being gay thing was really shocked me because, you know, that, that's
*  the thing, because back in the day he was a Muslim and not from America.
*  So the idea that like he was secretly gay is so like, what?
*  Like, but you saw I got the guy's book.
*  You know that Muslims, particularly like in Afghanistan, there's like those
*  clean shaven boys that they pass around.
*  You got the dancing boys of Afghanistan, the bells.
*  They do gay stuff.
*  So what does that mean?
*  He's a hardcore Muslim.
*  But that guy that Tucker had on his show was, that was so fucking bananas that he
*  decided to do that, have that guy on the guy that said he sucked Obama's dick on
*  Tucker's show.
*  Dude, I took Obama, I took the crack money from him.
*  Then I sucked his dick.
*  And I sucked his dick again.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah, it was, uh, pretty hot.
*  He was a young Obama.
*  He gets, it sounds like a hot, like a porn of like, I was in town.
*  Yeah.
*  I go, you know, a guy they go, yeah, that was a college student.
*  Hi, I'm a young Obama.
*  I'll do whatever man.
*  Well, wasn't he like a Senator at the time or something like that?
*  What was this guy claiming?
*  Was he a law student?
*  What was he claiming?
*  I, it was some less, something funny to laugh at.
*  The only thing that's like a real undisputed thing was that news that came out.
*  Cause Mike McCray lives down here and does a good Obama impression.
*  He called in and it'd come out in his biography.
*  This is by some liberal college professor.
*  He, there's like a paperback of it or something where it's letters to his
*  girlfriend.
*  He used to be with, he used to be like this white girl in college, I guess.
*  Yeah.
*  As well as I was like, I have sex all the time with men in my mind.
*  Cause I'm trying not, you didn't see that news.
*  Yeah, I did see that.
*  So there's a funny joke McCray had is doing.
*  He goes, Hey, look, I saw a bang girl with pink hair, did an art suit.
*  That's what you got to tell them.
*  Yeah.
*  You want bang girl nose ring.
*  Got to say, think about gay sex in your head.
*  So I laughed at the time, but then I think about it.
*  I'm like, I wouldn't know who the fuck would write that.
*  Was he trying to break up with her?
*  And this is how he tried to let her down.
*  I'm really into guys in my head.
*  Like take the hint.
*  Yeah, but that's a crazy.
*  And then, so here's what happens because the thing becomes hard to find.
*  So the step for you saying what I was saying was, yeah, it's all crazy thing
*  they're saying, but they've done such crazy things to counteract it.
*  And it makes you go, wait, is something that you didn't think anything was there.
*  Right.
*  But then the way they react, you're like, wait, did you do something like, right.
*  Right.
*  You could make it Tom Cruise.
*  Remember when he sued, cause people said he was gay.
*  And he sue.
*  You don't remember that.
*  It made him really, he's not gay by the way.
*  It made him look really gay.
*  Like what, what Hulk Hogan, when his wife said he was gay with
*  Brutus and Barbara beefcake.
*  Hulk said, if I was gay, I'd celebrate it.
*  And he was dressed like he's clearly gay.
*  And he goes, I would celebrate it.
*  And it was okay.
*  So like, if you react to it in a way like that, and you know, it was always like
*  old rich, old money, rich families that are unaccustomed to like anything less
*  than full PBS respect.
*  Like, uh, uh, and so they, they don't know how to react.
*  And the from, it's like the old school way of dealing with problems.
*  That thing you said about being 70.
*  I didn't even consider that, dude.
*  That's a great point.
*  How does 70 year olds deal with scandal compared to now how you would deal with it?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like the, the same techniques of covering up a UFO, like they have to
*  use to cover up their weird thing.
*  Well, this scandal was, first of all, it's real simple.
*  No matter what, even if you're just a woman, you're a pedophile, even if you're
*  just a woman, so that's one.
*  Number two is very easy to find out if you're a woman.
*  We do a chromosome test.
*  I think that like in Crocodile Dundee, he just grabbed the chair.
*  Oh, who knows what's going on down there, but very easy.
*  We can extract some DNA and we can find out if you're a man or a woman.
*  Yeah.
*  That's very easy.
*  Yeah.
*  Now, if you have.
*  I take less evidence even.
*  XY chromosome.
*  You're a fucking guy.
*  Here we go with the conspiracies.
*  Oh, this is your conspiracy talk now.
*  If you, if you could prove that that would be the wildest thing, like what Candace
*  Owens tried to do.
*  Do you think that's what got her fired?
*  No, I say that as a joke, but it was.
*  It has to be a pile on of multiple sort of offenses.
*  Yes.
*  I think that's, I think that's what it is.
*  But so pedophiles, just for the record, they shouldn't say it has to be because
*  that's not true.
*  Do you remember when they tried to put pedophilia in the psychology book as an
*  orientation?
*  Yes.
*  And so at the time I had no idea what like, well, it was like you're gay for
*  kids, right?
*  That's what I was thinking.
*  And you know, Brendan told me he was dating some psychologist is no, because
*  gay would be, you would marry, you want to get married and be with the person
*  probably, you know what I mean?
*  Like the thing of gay, an orientation, not gay, excuse me.
*  Orientation is you want to have your like toothbrush with their toothbrush
*  ultimately.
*  And with pedophiles, once you get older, they don't want you no more.
*  So if they're still together all this time, that's true love and not pedophilia,
*  but it is rape.
*  What it was.
*  Well, I don't even know if it is.
*  It's not pedophilia anymore.
*  People go, it's France.
*  My girlfriend, well, it's France.
*  You ever heard that?
*  Yeah, it's France.
*  What?
*  We should examine France.
*  Is that why they give kids wine?
*  Well, that's where fucking what's his face went over.
*  When there was wanted for rape, the director, Roman Polanski, that's where he's from.
*  Yeah.
*  He went over there and they're like, no, we keep him.
*  He is when the virus is there.
*  Cause they get it.
*  Yeah.
*  This is normal.
*  This is normal.
*  The home of postmodernism.
*  This is normal.
*  13 is normal.
*  Yeah.
*  You are so uptight with your.
*  USA with it.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like, even if at the end of the day, he did marry his teacher who was a
*  woman, it's still bonkers.
*  That's more bonkers than.
*  It's all things bonkers.
*  And, but the really bonkers thing is like, if this person has kids and they're a man
*  actually, and they had kids before they transition, where the fuck is the woman
*  that had the babies?
*  Dude, I was laughing before.
*  Cause I thought you were saying the kids might've came out of his dick hole.
*  I swear to God, I misunderstood what you were saying.
*  I was like, it's hilarious.
*  Like, but there has to be a woman.
*  There has to be a mom.
*  And then there's the kids, the kids, you have to pull the kids.
*  It's like, who's your mom?
*  Why are you a misogynist?
*  Where'd your mom go?
*  What happened?
*  Okay.
*  That's your mom.
*  Definitely.
*  Are we all.
*  From the beginning.
*  Okay.
*  We're good.
*  We're all Michael Jackson now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a mystery who the mom, where did this came from?
*  Cheap swab from you, ma'am.
*  I just would like to find out for sure, because I'm rooting for you to be a man
*  because it just makes it.
*  I would support this more.
*  More so crazy and so bonkers.
*  I'm rooting for it.
*  France.
*  Do you know, you ever see the old inner like Brian Volk is comic told me about.
*  I never in the night.
*  What is that stuff?
*  It's a CBD bomb.
*  I got a tight muscle in my lower back.
*  You ever use this shit?
*  No, I thought you had a rash.
*  I was like, no, no, no.
*  This is a CBD MD.
*  This is a, it's really good stuff.
*  Oh yeah.
*  CBD that you put on your muscles and it like significantly relaxes your muscles.
*  And it's a roll on so you can kind of like dig it into the muscle.
*  It loosens things up.
*  Yeah, you was like, is I, should I hit that?
*  I'm not going to do anything for you.
*  I don't think you should share those.
*  No, no.
*  Um, the Macron thing, what were you saying?
*  I forgot.
*  Cause I was thinking about that.
*  That roll on that roll.
*  Yeah.
*  The, even if it's just what it is, but when Candice Owens had that whole show about
*  it, I was like, she said, I will stake my reputation in my job.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, my professional reputation.
*  Oh, draw deep, I do.
*  Oh, that guy.
*  Yeah.
*  So Brian reminds me, I don't know, in the nineties in an interview and like, I
*  want to say vanity fair.
*  He just said when he was younger, he raped a, and he's like really young, like
*  nine or something goes, yeah, that's when I did my first rape.
*  What?
*  Dude, put it in.
*  Okay.
*  So that's how I reacted.
*  I was like, come on.
*  I looked up and sure enough, I don't remember.
*  I think he was in a movie called my father, the hero, which was a
*  Disney movie at that point.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That movie is a whole weird movie.
*  Oh, it resurfaced is what happened in 1978 interview.
*  De Pardo reportedly confirmed a story that he first participated in a
*  rape when he was nine years old and he had participated in more rape since then.
*  It was France.
*  We had too much wine.
*  Is France just like super rapey?
*  Uh, Rapier.
*  What the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like such, by the way, France is the country.
*  That, uh, Haiti had to pay reparations to for not being, wait until
*  like the eighties through chase bank.
*  Yeah.
*  What?
*  Yeah.
*  Chase is the media.
*  Is that great?
*  But I'm the eighties rolling around.
*  They go, this is a thing called the computer.
*  I think we should get out now.
*  This is going to be ugly for us.
*  Okay.
*  Let's pull out of this reparation.
*  Well, France couldn't take that to arbitration because it seems like
*  they're getting fucked, but there's no, that makes backdoos.
*  That's the crazy thing in the world that cause you always hear like it comes up
*  like in LA Gavin, American psycho hair here.
*  He's like, yeah, well, we're going to do slave reparations just in California
*  for like some great, and people get mad.
*  Have you seen what they done in Boston today?
*  Um, another no white parties of this, these black churches want $15 billion
*  in reparations from the white churches.
*  To the black churches.
*  Nice.
*  And they're out there.
*  Yes.
*  We, and this should be paid as follows.
*  It'll be like $5 billion at first and upfront payment and then another
*  5 billion and like they've got it mapped out that they're, they're actually
*  demanding $15 billion from these white churches.
*  Like, what's the angle guys?
*  What are you talking about?
*  But all the, it's all, it's all like,
*  nonsense.
*  Money.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It's to get you to fucking give a shit.
*  Every petty, stupid.
*  So the reparations, I say to people fight about that.
*  Not, not that that's absolutely bad shit.
*  We just told me.
*  Yeah.
*  But when people, when people talk about slave reparations, they talk about like,
*  first of all, do you think that that would be the, the real tragedy of our
*  government spending would be on that?
*  We gave like $300 billion probably to Ukraine.
*  So for that amount of money, not only could you pay slave reparations to the
*  wrong people, they could be half people that just got here and nothing to do
*  with it.
*  You'd have enough leftover to pay all the white people that feel bad about
*  reparations.
*  They could have a reparations and you'd have plenty of money for other shit.
*  And like, so then every time somebody argues about, Oh, what is the morals?
*  Like, yo dude, we give all our money to go kill other people.
*  You, we could have a candy land of moron shit here for years if they didn't do
*  that.
*  Yeah.
*  I feel like an idiot even like, but we can't do it, but I don't know.
*  That money came out of nowhere.
*  Like where was, they have a magic machine.
*  Would you not get out the world?
*  And on a cloud beam, dude, I'm telling you.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, we were, we were talking about the UFO thing.
*  Oh, um, you had sent me a video of a UFO thing that I sent to Jeremy Corbell and
*  he says it's bullshit.
*  Which one?
*  The one where the plane gets circled by the drones.
*  Oh, okay.
*  So like, I know, I know that video went around, but I was listening to that
*  autistic man talking about the ins and outs of how they looked at it.
*  Yeah.
*  Um, uh, so, you know, if you go on the like rabbit hole shit of, of, uh, all
*  this stuff, you know, like, you know, you know, I do.
*  So, you know, uh, uh, how, uh, who's the guy?
*  Jack Parsons that, that was a, the father of rocketry in America.
*  There was something they call him and he's the guy who blew up from
*  fulminated mercury L Ron Hubbard stayed at his house and he was like, they're
*  trying to bring about Babylon rise in Babylon spelled wrong by the way, which
*  is that Alastair Crowley Thelima kind of bullshit and, um, dude, it makes me laugh
*  so much every time I think about all the history of rockets, these dick shaped
*  objects that we shoot up, they, okay.
*  One part of rocket science is all the stuff I can't do.
*  Right.
*  The other part of it is going in the desert and jerking off and looking
*  into L Ron Hubbard's eyes.
*  Well, like the key component
*  rocketry in this country is connected to two things that are evil.
*  Nazis and Satanism.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, if you think it's evil, jerk off and look in the eyes of an
*  ingrate for us, but it makes me laugh.
*  So it's all this weird magic.
*  Yeah.
*  So, um, it's all this weird magical shit and, uh, it's so closely.
*  So now when you, they talk about the, they don't go, you just weird debate.
*  Like, I don't think it's ETS, it's extra dimensional something.
*  And there's a lot of religious kind of channels that are like, obviously these
*  are the Nephilim from the Bible, all that bullshit.
*  And, um, I don't think, uh,
*  see that thing that boom is actually, um, that's video game.
*  That's from a video game.
*  No, it's not.
*  It doesn't match up, but it does match up.
*  It doesn't match up except for some parts of it where it looks like it's partially
*  altered, but obviously if you're going like, there's a video that breaks it down,
*  how it matches that not only does it match up the edges, like match up precisely
*  at certain points of it, it looks like an altered version of that image.
*  That's like a stock footage of some kind of explosion and you're doing it through
*  filters and you're adjusting the way the image looks, but a visual effects guy
*  went over it and explained multiple reasons why he thinks it's fake.
*  Well, that's a good, someone is actual expert.
*  But you should know that a visual effects guy expert also went over if CNN
*  discolored your face and he said they did it.
*  Come on.
*  You think I'm really, we did CNN hired guy.
*  Who the, that's, here's the point.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you can't trust that now.
*  Like they're going to do you personally.
*  And then you're going to go, well, this like, I won't say I know or don't know on
*  a thing, but the way I look at it, that video's bullshit.
*  It could be.
*  Cause there's a lot of those videos that are bullshit.
*  That's the point.
*  As soon as the questions around a thing that's not solved, we're like, well, wait,
*  what is this?
*  And there's some weirdness.
*  Hey, maybe someone put that out as disinformation.
*  There's that.
*  Why are like, if, if there's nothing and they've been doing this, it's just, they
*  want to make us think they have UFOs.
*  Okay.
*  That's possible.
*  Totally.
*  That is crazier than if they just found something, the government to create a
*  George Lucas level lore of aliens in the popular consciousness for no reason other
*  than to like hide what you have nicer shit that flies.
*  That's insane.
*  That's fucking like hiding that your wife is a man and you're the president of
*  France.
*  It's that level insane.
*  Sort of.
*  Why would you trust your anything about your country ever again?
*  If they did that to you?
*  Well, because it's military secrets and they've always hidden military secrets.
*  Yeah.
*  They hid all the military secrets about the stealth bombers.
*  They, they had a bunch of military.
*  And you know what?
*  A lot of good has come out of that.
*  They hid the actual existence of area 51.
*  No, I know.
*  Yeah.
*  Why would I?
*  So now that I know they're lying every fucking time, and then if I'm lucky in 20
*  years, I'll be allowed to know, or the president will, will go, I looked it over
*  and, and you wouldn't put it out there either.
*  I think I would put it out there, but you know, I probably shouldn't be president.
*  But that that's the thing.
*  Like, uh, who said this?
*  I can't remember who it's on my quote, but your nation is as sick as it's secrets.
*  And that's how whatever's in there is how sick, sick fuck of a country it is.
*  Right.
*  If it, if it's so sick that it's actual aliens that are visiting us and they're
*  using human beings as like vessels for souls.
*  And I don't buy any of the stories of like, do you remember men in black?
*  We'll see the great Will Smith, the great Will Smith and the opening.
*  I call him slappy.
*  You're mean.
*  When, uh, okay.
*  So the slappy Smith, the, the narration with a timely, where, where are them?
*  We're the ones that handle the things.
*  You can live your stupid fucking moron peasant life.
*  Right.
*  Thanks guys.
*  Thanks.
*  It takes a great seat to handle the information.
*  Only someone that we tested as great as Will Smith could even handle the
*  knowledge of knowing the truth.
*  And he's doing helping you out by keeping it a secret movie.
*  Right.
*  But what's the message of the fucking move?
*  All the movies, the messages.
*  Yeah.
*  We need to have these people that lie because it's too big of a truth.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what they always say.
*  You need to lie motherfucker.
*  You need to, for your power thing to work, you need to not you.
*  So that, no, they don't have to lie.
*  It's all, it's always bullshit.
*  They don't have to lie.
*  The only thing they have to lie about is they want to keep the business going.
*  And it's never been for your good that they lied.
*  It's for the good of the people who fucked up before.
*  So they don't get in trouble.
*  Right.
*  And they sell it to you.
*  Like it's your fucking problem.
*  Damn, Kurt, you sound like an old man on a porch.
*  That was my goal in life.
*  I embrace it.
*  Mad about the government.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I'm not mad about it.
*  I'm mad about people not being knowing about it.
*  One of two things is real.
*  Either it is ours and they're awesome at keeping secrets much to our dismay, or
*  it's someone else from another planet.
*  And they're also awesome at keeping secrets, which is even kind of crazier.
*  Both things are pretty crazy.
*  If they can really keep under wraps the fact that we have been visited forever by
*  extraterrestrial beings, that's pretty nuts.
*  And if it's not, and it's just a con story that they're running to try to mask some
*  sort of a secret propulsion's program that's been going on since the 1980s.
*  That's pretty crazy.
*  Well, let me ask you this.
*  Think of this stunning amount of time.
*  They've been able to keep this secret that maybe women don't have dicks.
*  The things that they keep secret are so insane.
*  Like, of course they can keep a secret.
*  You know how you keep a secret?
*  Ro- Roy Cohn, the great Roy Cohn showed us how to keep his, you know, two can keep
*  us, three can keep a secret if two are dead.
*  The old, the old saying.
*  No, three can keep a secret if each of the three guys agrees to stick his dick into
*  something he shouldn't stick it in on camera and they each have that blackmail on
*  each other and then you can keep all kinds of secrets for a very long time.
*  Now you're talking.
*  So what do we do to make sure that people keep secrets?
*  We have them suck a dick with a skull mask on to put a minute to two.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Film it.
*  Right.
*  Dude, why do frats, the things you've heard about of like Ookie Cookie or all that
*  shit, Big Jay knew all the names of all of them.
*  And you're like, wait, why did you have to do that to join?
*  I went to an honor school.
*  They didn't have frats, but oh, I know why it's trickled down from the upper
*  classes of weird shit to your ass to Oxford.
*  That's how you pick a president.
*  Yeah, no shit.
*  You don't want a president that doesn't have any fucking footage of him sucking a
*  dick with a clown mask on.
*  I won't accept it.
*  Then you're never going to be able to trust that guy.
*  What if he goes rogue?
*  What if he goes JFK?
*  Yeah.
*  What if he crumbles under the weight of the hideous things he knows and gets the
*  bright idea snitching?
*  I would encourage snitching on what's great about right now.
*  This is the other reason I'm not like unhappy, even though I'm continuously like,
*  are you kidding about every, every single new thing?
*  I'm like, oh, so nothing I've ever heard was right.
*  Right.
*  I was like, okay, right.
*  Sounds great.
*  Uh, I love watching it every level it's collapsing and you don't have to do
*  anything except be a disgruntled enough employee to be like, fuck it.
*  I'm saying it.
*  I don't care.
*  So now the P diddy thing, which like for two years, I would tell people it's
*  I mean, it's horrific, but it's also hilarious that it was like the big secret
*  that P diddy had make a bunch of these guys suck his dick and do weird shit.
*  Oh, do you think the government does it?
*  Well, P diddy does it.
*  Homes in LA and Miami raided by federal agents.
*  So the conspiracies of P diddy are like, you know, that as above, so below that
*  like a magical shit the rocket scientists say when they jerk off and look at each
*  other's eyes.
*  What?
*  Duncan will know as above.
*  Hey, ask Duncan, but as above, so below.
*  You've heard that saying, yes, I want to write a hermetic magic book called as
*  the carpet, so the drapes by Kermis Mets, Trajanos with all my occult knowledge
*  that I picked up from looking into UFOs.
*  Uh, that like these things are like reflections all the way up.
*  So like at every level of society, there's something like Vince McMahon went down.
*  His empire.
*  Yeah.
*  I've given out Canadian top hats and chigs.
*  At every level, there's something I want to joke about it on stage, but people like,
*  you know, nobody follows all the same things anymore.
*  So it's hard to the things I want to make references about.
*  There's like no common culture anymore of like, we all saw this.
*  So you got to burn time explaining the first part of the story.
*  And, uh, with Vince McMahon, dude, I'll ask, is anybody know like people that
*  know, know what he did or what it's claimed that he did.
*  I only came out cause he didn't want to pay her the full money.
*  If, if he were paid 3 million to do all horrific things and you're like, yeah,
*  I'll do that.
*  Then I'd be like, no, well, that's not assault, but this fucker didn't want to
*  pay cause he's a, has a history of fucking people on shit and all he had to do was
*  pay what he agreed to.
*  And she's a disgruntled employee and good for her because that guy shit on her.
*  They're having a three, they don't say what position I don't think.
*  I hope it's Eiffel tower and not a blowjob.
*  He did this during two on one with, I'm guessing, Johnny Leonidas.
*  I don't know.
*  Another executive.
*  So they're both, they're both having sex with this girl.
*  This man gets up, shits on her head.
*  And then he goes, I'm going to go get you guys finish up.
*  I'm going to get a shower.
*  This is what's written in the legal.
*  He defecate.
*  They say he defecates.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to, we'll finish up.
*  I think we're all, I think we're all done here.
*  Vince, should we, I think we're done.
*  Should we steal a man, his position?
*  And should we say he's an elderly gentleman involved in rigorous activities.
*  And oftentimes they lose control of their bowels is the reason why depends is
*  old people.
*  Well, that's a fair, if I was his lawyer, I would say Vince is a wonderful man who
*  respects women, but he's got bad bowels.
*  Well, Jim, Joe, that's a great steel man.
*  And, but I would just say respectfully, the part where he goes, I'm in a shower.
*  You guys finish up right there is where I break with the idea that he just lost
*  control.
*  Well, he didn't want the party to be over just because he can't control his bowers.
*  It seems very considerate of him.
*  You guys finish up.
*  I'm going to shower.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Yeah, you get a shower in the party.
*  You go get a 30 minute shower.
*  Vince, I'll sit here with this chick.
*  Imagine having sex with someone with someone else's shit on their hair while
*  you're having sex.
*  No, it's a party foul for sure.
*  Smelling this guy's shit.
*  Like literally where your face is.
*  But I'll finish up.
*  Well, hey, miss, you want to finish up you with the.
*  That's so insane.
*  You with the stone cold steamer that you got.
*  Oh, maybe we'll just chat about nicknames.
*  There's nothing crazier.
*  Depraved act that you just did.
*  Than the depravity of shitting on people with feces.
*  OK, this is it.
*  Oh, my God.
*  I'm extreme depravity.
*  May 9th, 2020, he defecated on Miss Grant during a threesome and then commanded her
*  to continue pleasuring his friend with feces in her hair and running down her back.
*  All make man went to the bathroom.
*  I didn't see this part.
*  Wait, wait, I didn't see this part.
*  Upon his return from the bathroom, McMahon and his friend actively resumed the three.
*  She didn't get in and hose off.
*  You showered and went back and saw the girl who's heading back.
*  You should know why get a shower.
*  Oh, my God. So she didn't shower.
*  He got showered and she stayed.
*  Oh, my God.
*  With Bob Saget's closer on.
*  I also like how they just described it as his filth.
*  His filth.
*  I mean, is that like is this like a legal
*  document, a legal term like his filth?
*  He gave her a Polish car wash and he goes and cleans himself.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  Yeah, well, that's that.
*  So the P diddy thing.
*  Yeah. The disgruntled employees have been coming out years ago on.
*  The whole mafia has a podcast now, by the way, you might have seen.
*  Everybody has and and people will get in invested in it.
*  It's so much better than the mob has podcasts now.
*  Oh, and they have rivalries.
*  And there there's like people that are like, oh, well, I heard he's a snitch.
*  Like they're now like, do you have Stockholm syndrome?
*  Good. There is. That's why we have this great show.
*  The fucking I hope everyone snitches.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  So I get criminals.
*  He has a right to say as a fucking criminal, don't snitch.
*  You, the citizen of the good country.
*  You spoke. Edward Snow is not supposed to be hiding out in Russia with the bad man.
*  Right. He's the guy that did the right thing, right?
*  No. Some of us.
*  We kill snitches.
*  Like what is it?
*  But it's all falling apart.
*  So the P diddy quote is my it's Jaguar.
*  Wright said this, an ex employee of him.
*  He goes, if you can get a man to suck you dick, you can do anything.
*  As in a man that does not want to do that.
*  Yeah, that's a real it's like an affirmation.
*  It's like a real affirmation, power affirmation for someone.
*  But we know that people can get depraved enough to shit on people.
*  That's real.
*  I mean, that's all we do by porta potty.
*  That's what Instagram models do for 50 grand a pop.
*  We know people are depraved enough to try to get straight guys to suck their dick.
*  We've all heard of it.
*  That's pretty light.
*  I think you guys are going to ask me if I want to suck your dick.
*  So it's just straight stuff, dude.
*  Normal shit. No one around being bros.
*  No, I'm not. People really love this joke.
*  But I was like in the future, you know, like, you know, gay conversion therapy
*  they used to do. Yeah.
*  Right. The gay away. Yeah.
*  Yeah. With with hard on, like hugging you from behind.
*  Yeah. For like your parents pay like 30 grand to go to some weird, you know,
*  in the future, you're going to pay that money.
*  The conversion, you know, you're going to send your kid to a camp
*  so they can talk him down to just being gay.
*  You know, right. You know, like, hey, he's a he told me he's a diaper.
*  He has a for sauna. Can you just tell him he's gay?
*  And he's a cat. And he wants a litter box.
*  He thinks he's a cat.
*  They want a litter.
*  Oh, it's the covering up of the litter box thing.
*  Do you see that principle at play of like don't even talk about it?
*  Yeah, because it's the same principle as if you talk about
*  John Stewart putting a medal on a Nazi or Canada
*  applauding a real Nazi.
*  It helps Putin, the bad man.
*  So cover up the fact
*  that the Canadian House of Commons gave a standing ovation to a real
*  World War Two Nazi.
*  Why, by the way, why is he hiding out in Canada?
*  That's been allowed. Oh, but isn't it funny?
*  Like the way people realized what he was saying
*  when he was saying that he fought Russia.
*  Yeah, my girlfriend went to Jacksonville public schools
*  and she picked it out.
*  She's the one who said something first.
*  Just wait, would that mean that with the Nazis?
*  We all learn that just like from Call of Duty games just a few years
*  like not that long ago.
*  Isn't that insane that fighting against the Russians?
*  You can say it as a positive thing now.
*  Even if you did it while you were a Nazi, you could say it
*  like the communists still.
*  They act like they're the Soviets.
*  He won't do it.
*  If you say this, anyone who's if you see Montevideo and they go,
*  Putin wants to rebuild the Soviet empire.
*  Now, if you just some Joe Schmo saying that to me, OK, you just know nothing.
*  That's you're right, as an American.
*  People in charge saying that stupid fucking shit
*  that he wants to rebuild that you are a fucking either a liar or you're a fucking chump.
*  You're probably like a, you know, an innocent chump like Chris
*  Cuomo or some shit.
*  But that's domino theory.
*  You're still selling domino theory to people.
*  The Vietnam Vietnam, that thing that we lost.
*  And they're doing great.
*  Communism has never worked.
*  Well, Vietnam won.
*  And also, it's a great vacation spot.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  I don't believe in communism.
*  OK, I thought it doesn't work.
*  So why are you spending everybody's money to go make a thing that doesn't work?
*  Not work. That seems like a waste to me.
*  That's our entire first half.
*  Now it's Russia.
*  We want to weaken Russia.
*  A friend of mine said this to me, who's a comic.
*  He goes, but isn't it good?
*  We're weakening Russia.
*  Oh, the guy with the hair that you brought up, that CIA guy.
*  He was listening to reasons is great.
*  We get to we have old weapons we weren't using.
*  We get to use those on the battlefield and see how it'll be for a coming war
*  with China, of course.
*  We they want to fight Lindsey Graham.
*  Miss Lindsey Graham like they want to fight the last man.
*  Oh, my. That's a great impression.
*  Yeah, it's easy. Oh, they want to.
*  This is the best money we ever spent.
*  There is something really crazy about watching that guy
*  Roy Cronge beat the drums of war.
*  He's been doing it my like my whole life.
*  But when he says it, like in an aggressive way, there's
*  when he makes statements in an aggressive way, it's like it's very bizarre.
*  He's a good actor.
*  But it's very bizarre.
*  It's very bizarre to like listen to it in his voice.
*  Yeah, well, that's a different which is the gentleman down here.
*  It's not any doesn't mean any.
*  You don't have to do a conspiracy theory about me.
*  We are going to make them pay.
*  Down they will fight to the last man.
*  OK, so here's how is that inspiring?
*  Joe, you just said the thing.
*  So they're saying this like the CIA.
*  He's going like, there's a great idea.
*  So we want Russia.
*  They're our enemy.
*  So we got these crash test dummies
*  that we're going to just grind them into hamburger.
*  Isn't that good?
*  And use our old weapons we were using in creating jobs.
*  Is that good?
*  No, that's despicable.
*  That's lower than any shit I've ever heard about in another country
*  that we want to have a war with another country.
*  We're not secret openly bragging about it.
*  We're going to get these other people who can't win.
*  And they're not winning, by the way, and just kill off most of the pop.
*  Well, all their able bodied people, average age 50
*  of their soldiers, the average age of soldiers 50.
*  You aware of that in Ukraine? Yeah.
*  How many soldiers have died?
*  I don't know. I don't know for sure, but it's at least half a million.
*  If you include people that can never do anything again,
*  that are just injured, you know, the wounded and shit.
*  The numbers they tell you are always lie.
*  They're the same shit they did with Iraq and Afghanistan.
*  No, it's it's working.
*  You know, we just got to keep putting a little more money into like a drunk.
*  We just got to keep putting more money into it.
*  Ukraine has lost a half a million people.
*  Able body. Yeah.
*  Well, the deaths are probably that high.
*  You know, you got to you got to do Coralitos way method with the numbers
*  they give you. Right.
*  So they tell you it's 50,000 is probably 100,000. Right.
*  So you got to look at it like that because they're
*  everything's a fucking lie that the people that you're supposed to believe say.
*  So now what the fuck, man.
*  Yeah. So now now, you know, our our first wife, our main wife, Israel needs us.
*  So our side, our side piece, Ukraine.
*  Hey, Zalinsky, we it was a great while it lasted, man.
*  It's time to you know, it's getting weird now.
*  Yeah. Like he's going to say he's pregnant.
*  That's his last move.
*  But America, it's I'm pregnant. It's yours.
*  That's all he's got left.
*  I'm pregnant with a war.
*  Here's the order of of nations that I care about.
*  Age is 50. You haven't heard this.
*  I have heard this.
*  Did you see the video of the sad old men that look older than me?
*  I'm realizing now that I did hear something about it.
*  And it was also they were talking about how they stop people from trying to escape
*  to make them fight.
*  There's a three hundred dollar rubber mask that looks like from the movie Drive
*  that you can get to look old so they don't grab you and put you in a fucking van.
*  Oh, my God. Oh, they're oh, they're taking everybody, by the way.
*  Women, they're putting in force.
*  So they've lost. So they lost.
*  That's the truth.
*  Why don't we just kill another fucking amount of them until?
*  By the way, Russia's not weak.
*  They're they're doing better.
*  I feel like Wolf Blitzer.
*  But but you made Russia weak, right?
*  Like we can't confirm that.
*  In fact, we didn't.
*  When Tucker went there and showed the subway, this is where John Stewart,
*  he says something great, like on Colbert Colbert show about clearly
*  who overcame from a lab.
*  We work with them again, by the way, for the record.
*  And then he's fucking does this.
*  He goes, well, that's the price of freedom.
*  You have the National Guard in your subway and it looks like shit.
*  And you're saying, oh, we're so free here.
*  That's why our subway, that's why nothing is running correctly.
*  That he's smarter than that.
*  That dude, that's fucking shitty.
*  Well, it's also it's echo chamber thinking, you know,
*  and you find ways to support what the echo chamber has sort of established.
*  I'm doing that. Yeah, stop doing.
*  You don't have to fight nobody.
*  You have to march. Just stop doing that.
*  Everybody at once.
*  It'll it'll end the whole thing. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's a problem.
*  It's a real problem.
*  And it's also a problem that's being used to manipulate people
*  to think one way or another.
*  You know, they'll they'll use that and manipulate you with that.
*  Just comment.
*  You know, a lot of times I'll look at something like a kooky conspiracy thing.
*  Like I was reading about, what is it?
*  Monarch, the one that's like after Ultra.
*  And it was making me laugh because the thing they're saying is like these
*  the scientists have kids in these cages and they they shock one cage
*  and they go, I love you.
*  And they don't shock one.
*  They go, I love you not.
*  And shock the other one to make them.
*  It's like a mind control conspiracy.
*  But while I'm reading it,
*  I was laughing because it just sounded like a metaphor for our actual entire society.
*  Like, I don't know if that shit's real.
*  I'm sure it could be, but I don't know.
*  But when you read it, it sounds like a metaphor for all of society.
*  The I love you.
*  Maybe a cat Williams talking about the homeless people seeing
*  all these illegals getting cards, money, cards with money.
*  Yeah, that's a great point you made like homeless people.
*  You're laying on the ground watching people that aren't from here getting, getting.
*  That's that sums it up right there.
*  You know, it really is like at every level, there's this fucking
*  just like a scam and you're supposed to buy into every will.
*  Every level, every level.
*  The the homeless people thing is a great example.
*  Just poor people in America, realizing that these people are getting
*  $10,000 a month, that whole fucking thing that they were trying to do
*  and with Eric Adams and in New York, that it all, you know,
*  you get an ATM card and you get like a certain amount of money.
*  You're debunking that.
*  Can I just debunk that real quick?
*  Yeah. The debunkings are worse than that.
*  They go, no, you guys, it's not.
*  Listen, I know you're an alt right conservative guy, Joe, and and you're making it.
*  But you have to understand, it's actually cheaper.
*  See, they were actually giving them weight like they're spending more,
*  giving them money before this.
*  The card is just to be to streamline it.
*  And it'll actually be cheaper in the.
*  You were giving them more money before this.
*  And that's your debunking.
*  How much do they get?
*  No, it's only enough when you add up all the family members, Joe.
*  Now, see, you're getting conspiratorial again.
*  It's just enough to buy food and diapers and things that,
*  you know, people from here need if they all get $10,000.
*  Is that real? That seems so insane.
*  Did I move to Alaska from my home?
*  Got $700 a one time.
*  The people in Hawaii and you know, many kids are missing still.
*  Did they ever find those missing kids, the thousands of them?
*  Or did Oprah find a buyer?
*  I don't know. Yeah, they didn't do nothing for them people.
*  But these are going to be baffled. They don't vote for Biden.
*  They're going to be baffled.
*  Imagine if these people are literally getting $10,000 checks
*  and the people in Maui got 700 bucks.
*  You don't imagine that's what happened. Right.
*  That's what I'm getting to.
*  Like, this is the world that we're living in.
*  This is how upside down everything is.
*  And people that want to pretend that anything makes sense,
*  whether it's on the left or the right, people that want to pretend that any of
*  this makes sense, you're all out of your fucking mind.
*  A family of four is expected to receive up to $350 per week under the program,
*  which will last six weeks, city officials said.
*  The program would begin with 10 families on Monday,
*  expanding to about 115 families or roughly 450 people over the next week.
*  Wasn't there something about keeping $10,000 in an account on an ATM card?
*  So what that was about?
*  I'll bet you the numbers he was connected somehow.
*  The mayor was supposedly connected somehow to it.
*  It's New York, of course.
*  All the everything's corrupt at every level.
*  It's not a little bit. It's the whole thing.
*  Er, I mean, yeah, correct.
*  Well, I like that.
*  Oh, yeah. One more time.
*  One more thing. Yeah, it's about Haiti.
*  No, Danny Shaw, you should look up if you want to know.
*  It's it's like really upsetting.
*  And because now the people that what I'm seeing on the channels
*  that I like to, you know, where they're I'm more conservative.
*  The great now these Haitians are going to come in.
*  It's like the reason all these people are rushing in and it's intentional.
*  It's a hundred percent intentional. All these NGOs and shit.
*  They and the corporations want to flood with immigrants.
*  It lowers wages.
*  They need the military need soldiers.
*  We've done this many times throughout history.
*  You saw gangs in New York, right?
*  The Irish. Yeah. OK.
*  They want to.
*  It's all military age men being brought in to completely like.
*  What's the word I'm looking for?
*  I'm so glad.
*  Well, you eliminate legitimate patriotism
*  because if you got people that come from other countries,
*  then you arm them and have them go against the people that were here.
*  Originally, Dick Durbin saying on C-SPAN, that that's what we're doing.
*  This is the 10,000 number, but I don't know where they get the.
*  Oh, this is up to.
*  It would give migrants up to $10,000.
*  It would give migrants up to $10,000
*  each in taxpayer money with no ID check, no restrictions and no fraud control.
*  So that means they get $10,000.
*  So I don't know where they got that.
*  Maybe that is like the limit for the 350 bucks.
*  Like when it gets to here, that it's a thousand dollar up to a thousand dollars
*  each month.
*  So maybe it's like at the end of $10,000, they cut you off.
*  But also the more I've heard, maybe it's not true.
*  That debit card can only be used at particular places.
*  Yeah, for the things that cost the most in society now, like for people
*  that have a business connection to the company that's issuing the money.
*  That way they can get all the money.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's so.
*  Look, so that's crazy.
*  That's 100% crazy.
*  So that's your Democrat side.
*  But the people doing that flooding in,
*  besides the ones that the government and these companies put on purpose,
*  we fucked their country up and the people on top know that we've.
*  That's how we got like member cocaine cowboys
*  with like the Cuban, the Mariel boatlift and all.
*  There's waves of this as because we went somewhere
*  and they have shit that we want and we take it, you know, like Hitler did.
*  OK, and we go, hey, Haiti, it's pretty fucked up.
*  You're not slaves.
*  I hope first you're paying France back.
*  Number one. Yeah.
*  You're paying them back into the 80s for the not being slaves.
*  And we're and they have lots of natural resources, all those iridium,
*  like rare earth minerals we need for electric,
*  EV initiatives around the world.
*  There are sweatshops.
*  You thought it was all Uyghurs? No, we make Haitians do.
*  We've invaded for them, wanting like 37 cents more to make Levi's.
*  We've invaded my four times.
*  We're about to have Kenya invade them for us.
*  How we do it, Ukraine, the crash dummy method,
*  because it doesn't look good for us to invade
*  while we're yelling at all these invasions Putin did.
*  We're doing worse to Haiti than anything he did to Ukraine on any level.
*  That's a fucking fact.
*  But Danny Shaw, if you want a good source, that's the guy. OK.
*  Let's wrap this up. Kurt, you're the man.
*  Did that last time I was going to.
*  I laughed so that that it doesn't send me down a road, though, dude.
*  Well, I have to deal with this. So why shouldn't you?
*  I'm a woman, by the way, you started going to Jimmy Doerr show like you.
*  You immediately like became once you see it.
*  Yeah, once you see it, you can't unsee it.
*  It's horrible. I don't recommend it.
*  I don't recommend it. The end.
*  All right. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
*  Thanks, brother. That was fun. Thanks, man.
