# Joe Rogan Experience #1378 - Greg Fitzsimmons
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 06, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDni5sKbAII)
*  Three, two, one.
*  Gregory!
*  Joseph!
*  Sober October's over.
*  But, uh, we were allowed to smoke cigars during Sober October for whatever reason.
*  But they do get you high.
*  They do give you a nice little buzz.
*  They do.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird that that's, like, thought of as being a sobriety thing.
*  Is it really?
*  I mean, if you're smoking, people smoke cigarettes when they're sober.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking AA guys.
*  Remember, right?
*  Those guys were always...
*  These guys were always...
*  Those guys will tell you you can't have a non-alcoholic beer, which I do.
*  I have a non-alco...
*  I even had a drink.
*  It'll be fucking 30 years next month that I haven't had a drink.
*  Didn't you have, like, one or two when Meany died?
*  When Meany died, I had some scotch.
*  That's a weird one, right?
*  I had, like...
*  I didn't get drunk, but I had, like, a few shots.
*  Did you, like, feel weird about that?
*  I've been all those years.
*  I think I felt so weird about him being dead that the whole thing felt surreal anyway.
*  And I haven't really...
*  Haven't had the desire...
*  I can't say I can't have the desire.
*  It's more of just, like, you feel like there's times where you want to just do what everybody
*  else is doing and just chill out.
*  And you see everybody getting more mellow and relaxed and social.
*  And especially if I'm in a situation where, you know, it's a bunch of people I don't know
*  that well.
*  Maybe it's your kid's friend's parent kind of situation.
*  Nice glass of wine to take the edge off.
*  Dude.
*  Dude.
*  But you did the couple glasses of scotch and then you didn't go right back to it.
*  Like, you became a 21-year-old drunk Greg again.
*  Right.
*  Well, a lot of it has to do with my father.
*  And he was an alcoholic and I saw his depression, the guy had the same depression as he does,
*  and I felt like when I drank it wasn't always for fun.
*  It was a lot of times it was like dealing with feelings and bullshit like that.
*  And so I saw him as an unhappy guy who was unfulfilled in a lot of ways and I saw the
*  alcohol was a big part of why his life wasn't what it could have been.
*  And I just sort of feel like, you know, maybe I could drink but maybe I can't.
*  Why fuck with it?
*  No, why fuck with it?
*  I'll tell you what, man.
*  I just got done with a whole month of being sober and then I had my first drinks this
*  weekend.
*  I felt like shit.
*  No kidding.
*  I felt like shit.
*  Really.
*  I had a couple of glasses of wine, went to play pool and I was having a hard time focusing
*  on the ball.
*  I was like looking at the ball, I was like, three glasses of wine?
*  Yeah.
*  Three glasses of wine.
*  I'm having a hard time seeing.
*  Right.
*  It took like, cause everything's like, oh, just a little off.
*  It took like an hour for my liver process did enough where I could play pool well again.
*  Do you think you just lost your tolerance?
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I've never been a big drinker anyway, but it was interesting doing sets.
*  That's what's always interesting.
*  It's not like a shot before I go on stage.
*  I always like to do a shot of Jack before I go on stage.
*  Just, whoa.
*  That's a standard for you?
*  Yeah, a little bit of whiskey.
*  Wow.
*  For a big show, just one shot.
*  Bang.
*  Yeah.
*  Brian Regan, one shot of frozen peppermint schnapps before he goes on.
*  Or peach schnapps.
*  It gives you like this.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's not necessary.
*  It's definitely not.
*  I mean, I did a lot of shows this month.
*  Stone Cold Soba.
*  But it's...
*  Isn't it weird though?
*  The human condition, that we're born with this set of, you know, this brain and these
*  neurological pathways and this relationship to the universe and the people around us,
*  and that we want to, whether it's smoking pot or drinking or taking opiates, we want
*  to change the natural state of our brain.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that fucking weird?
*  It's very weird.
*  Because it's all we talk about.
*  All people talk about, dude, what'd you do last week?
*  Oh, dude, we got fucked up.
*  I changed my brain.
*  I made myself dumber.
*  All weekend, I made myself dumber.
*  Did a bunch of stupid shit I should have never done.
*  And I did stupid shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Because in our natural state, we don't do goofy shit enough.
*  But then I learned when I quit drinking that I could be just as crazy.
*  People didn't realize I quit.
*  I'd be hanging out with my same friends in the same bar, it's still four in the morning.
*  We'd go to a wedding, I'd be the last guy on the dance floor, first guy on the dance
*  floor.
*  And I just was like, you know, this doesn't have to change me, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  You can just enjoy fun.
*  You just enjoy fun.
*  It takes a little bit more of, I think you have to sort of break through walls a little
*  bit more, as opposed to just the booze does that for you.
*  Yeah.
*  But you can still get there.
*  Yeah, that's a good way of looking at it.
*  The one thing that I found that affects my writing, marijuana is like steroids for writing.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Really?
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah!
*  This weekend, as soon as I started getting high again, I'm fucking my notebook full.
*  No shit.
*  All these crazy ideas.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Half of them are dog shit for sure.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Half of them, at least half of them are dog shit.
*  Half would be you're doing pretty well.
*  Yeah, it's pretty good, right?
*  Yeah.
*  But I got a few that I'm like, ooh, there's something in this, there's something in this
*  one, definitely something in this one.
*  So is it like after the show you get high and then you write or you do it during the
*  day?
*  Well, I didn't do any shows this weekend because I was in New York for the UFC and
*  I had some friends that I wasn't going to see while I was down there, my friend Tommy,
*  so I was playing pool with him.
*  And Hinchcliffe came with me too, he plays pool too.
*  But I just decided not to do comedy this weekend.
*  I'm like, I'm here for the UFC, I only get a chance to see Tommy.
*  He's like one of my good friends from fucking 25 years ago, more, 28 years ago maybe?
*  I might know him for almost 30 years.
*  I've known him for fucking ever.
*  We've become old men together.
*  But we get together and play pool until like two o'clock in the morning.
*  I haven't had a chance to do that forever.
*  I don't really get a chance to do it once a year when I see him.
*  So I decided not to do any shows.
*  But just while we were playing, I was just getting all these ideas.
*  Generally I like writing at night when everyone's asleep.
*  That's my favorite time to write.
*  I like to come home from the store and I sit around with the laptop and I just start writing.
*  I just force myself to write for an hour or so.
*  Just write.
*  Just freeform, just get it all down.
*  Yeah, have a subject to start.
*  I don't try to write like in joke form.
*  I try to write like essays and then I try to extract ideas out of those and then turn
*  those into material.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
*  It's like I used to do this thing called the writer's way, which is this great way to,
*  if you're trying, it's not just for writing, but just to get your creativity flowing.
*  One of the things you do is you get out of bed in the morning and you don't have your
*  coffee, you just take a piss.
*  You don't have to take a piss.
*  You can shit.
*  If you want to shit, you can shit.
*  You're allowed to?
*  You're allowed to shit.
*  Okay.
*  As a matter of fact, I think that probably helps a lot.
*  Oh yeah, you don't want the shit inside of you.
*  You're trying to write.
*  Also what better feeling than your anus repuckered after delivering that it's ...
*  Just a giant dump of lung.
*  Just a little halo over the log floating in the water.
*  And then you sit down and you write three pages nonstop.
*  You don't let the pen stop.
*  And then you go about your day.
*  And you get out.
*  It's amazing what your subconscious will get out when you just keep the pen flowing.
*  And like you said, a lot of it's garbage, but within it, there's going to be a couple
*  kernels that are good.
*  Yeah, that's how creativity works with me.
*  I mean, I'm not a consistent hitter.
*  I'm not a 500 hitter in terms of creativity.
*  If I get half, half is amazing.
*  Half would be amazing.
*  500 is amazing.
*  Most of it's garbage.
*  Sometimes I go back and it gets frustrating reading some of the shit I wrote.
*  What the fuck?
*  But I know what I'm doing.
*  When I'm writing, I'm just trying to see if I could dig something out.
*  I'm out there with a metal detector.
*  Some guy just found some fucking incredible ancient treasure using a metal detector.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  See if you can find that, Jamie.
*  On a beach?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I want to say, fuck, what era was it from?
*  Ship, right?
*  No, no, that was a different one.
*  That was a guy.
*  Yeah, that was a crazy one too.
*  A guy found a fucking shipwreck that was on the beach that was exposed by a crazy storm.
*  Like a storm came along and it pulled away so much of the sand that a fucking shipwreck
*  was there.
*  Damn.
*  This guy's there walking his dog.
*  He's like, what the fuck is this?
*  This is a boat.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  Oh, here it is.
*  It's, what is that?
*  Three million pounds.
*  Is that pounds?
*  Our hoard of 6,000 gold artifacts from 650 AD uncovered in Staffordshire Field using
*  a two-pound metal detector, a metal detector for $2.
*  Wow.
*  Is that pounds or euros?
*  What is that one?
*  I think that's British pounds.
*  So from 650 AD, so 650 years after Jesus is murdered.
*  Shit.
*  Look at that shit.
*  Look how gorgeous that is.
*  Still got the fur on the top.
*  We're looking at a gold helmet, this really intricate carved gold helmet with a fucking,
*  like a mohawk, a fur mohawk.
*  That's amazing.
*  And look at the detail.
*  It wasn't corroded at all in that saltwater all those years.
*  Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
*  Where's Staffordshire?
*  It said it was in a field.
*  Right?
*  This wasn't, so this wasn't saltwater.
*  Oh my God.
*  Look how beautiful that shit is.
*  That's amazing.
*  A scabbard boss.
*  I don't even know what a boss is.
*  What is a boss?
*  A scabbard boss?
*  What does that mean?
*  Which is part of an Anglo-Saxon horde found by Terry Herbert.
*  Terry's balling right now.
*  Yeah.
*  How about Terry?
*  What did Terry do?
*  Did he sell it?
*  I mean, do you keep some?
*  You got to keep some of it.
*  Are you a lot?
*  What happens there?
*  Sold to museums for 3.285 million with the funds were split between them.
*  He used a metal detector.
*  Oh, in the field of farmer Fred Johnson.
*  Oh, so they split it.
*  Him and Fred split it up.
*  So they both got a million and a half.
*  Not bad.
*  Not bad.
*  But it's pounds to dollars.
*  It's not the same.
*  I think it's like a buck twenty.
*  So he's super balling.
*  Yeah.
*  Eighty percent of the items identified were fittings from weapons, mostly swords, and
*  research believe it's remarkable.
*  So many were made from gold.
*  Wow.
*  Shit.
*  Nine pounds of gold included were 50 incredible rare gold sword pommels as well as parts of
*  a golden helmet.
*  Fucking A man.
*  The golden age, this period of Anglo-Saxon England.
*  Literally.
*  This was a period when gold was suddenly much more available and was converted into beautiful
*  objects for the warrior elite.
*  I wonder why it was more available.
*  What makes gold more available?
*  Did they figure out how to pull it out of the ground or something?
*  They hadn't started grabbing it from other countries yet.
*  I guess that was their own local gold.
*  Look at this quotation.
*  Look at this.
*  The collection includes, it's believed, a battle shrine with a processional cross suggesting
*  Christian emblems were used as good luck charms for battle.
*  On it is a quotation from the book of number which reads, rise up Lord and let thine enemies
*  be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee.
*  Boy.
*  Yeah.
*  Wouldn't you love to hear people talk back then?
*  Yeah, right.
*  It probably was so confusing.
*  Game of Thrones, they talk like us, but they didn't talk like us.
*  They had some weird lingo back then.
*  Well, Game of Thrones is obviously fake, but it was supposed to be a long time ago, right?
*  Yeah, and I'm sure they researched.
*  Everything about that show was so authentic.
*  I'm sure they went back and tried to find the way people spoke at that time and replicate
*  it.
*  Not really though, because it's not really about a time.
*  It's about a fantasy land.
*  Well, I think it was the War of the Roses it was based on, which was, I think around
*  the first century, wasn't it?
*  Yeah, but they got fucking dark knights or white knights or whatever.
*  Oh yeah, no, they mixed a lot of it together.
*  But I think there was a point where the British Empire was divided into whatever it was, five
*  or six different kingdoms.
*  Oh, that's what they based it on?
*  Yeah, that were all fighting for the throne.
*  Apparently they're going to do a prequel now.
*  Like those guys, they were not going to do it, they were going to cancel it, but they're
*  going to do it now.
*  I heard it got canceled.
*  Did it get canceled?
*  Yeah.
*  But there was just something a couple of days ago that said they're doing a preview hundreds
*  of years before that's about the Targaryens.
*  That's awesome.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Get back after it, you fucks.
*  Come on.
*  Anything.
*  Give me anything.
*  The thing about that show is they kill everybody.
*  So they can always have new people.
*  Yeah.
*  They fucking kill everybody.
*  Remember the Red Wedding?
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Here you go.
*  They issued a statement on the canceled.
*  It's canceled.
*  Thumbs down.
*  Bad news.
*  It's over.
*  What?
*  Yeah, sorry.
*  What?
*  What did they say?
*  What's their statement?
*  They're bringing back Arliss so they need space.
*  That's why he won an Emmy, ladies and gentlemen.
*  That's right.
*  What is the statement?
*  Do they have a good excuse?
*  What could their good excuse be?
*  We suck and we hate money?
*  It's just as they decide not to move forward with the series.
*  Fuck out of here.
*  Part of the problem is that who's the guy that wrote all the books that it was based
*  on and he wrote the first?
*  George Martin.
*  George Martin wrote all of them until they got to the last season, the last two seasons,
*  and then he ran out of steam.
*  And that's why they weren't as good.
*  People say that last season wasn't as good as the rest because it was the two showrunners
*  that had...
*  I thought the last season was excellent up until the last episode.
*  Last episode was kind of like, how do we end this?
*  Yeah.
*  We're in a wheelchair or a king.
*  Let's make them gay too.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just...
*  Come on, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they didn't...
*  You know, when you think about the last episode of any show is going to get a lot...
*  Remember how much shit Seinfeld got for the last episode?
*  Yes.
*  Because they didn't do anything and Game of Thrones did the same thing.
*  They punted.
*  Yeah.
*  They didn't go for anything.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, the beautiful thing about News Radio's last episode is we didn't know it was our
*  last episode.
*  It was the only time we ever thought we were going to get picked up.
*  No shit.
*  And that was how many seasons?
*  Five.
*  The ratings were good.
*  Yeah.
*  The last season we were like, we did pretty good.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like, fuck it, it's over.
*  Why?
*  Probably because Phil was dead.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and Lovitz came back.
*  Lovitz replaced Phil, but...
*  How many seasons was that?
*  Just one?
*  Yes, the final season.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe, I mean, who knows?
*  It was also the problem with the News Radio was News Radio was not owned by NBC.
*  So it was one of those shows where we moved at least eight times during the five years
*  that we were on the air.
*  Your time slot.
*  Yeah, just always moving.
*  And this is before the internet, so you couldn't tell people.
*  It's not like you could tweet, hey, News Radio is going to be on Monday at 8 o'clock, but
*  you don't give a fuck because you have a DVR.
*  So just DVR it.
*  No, you found it when it was on, if you were lucky.
*  And they didn't advertise that much.
*  I was like, News Radio, moving to Friday at 8.
*  It just would move around.
*  We moved all over the place.
*  Was it on NBC?
*  NBC, yeah.
*  Did you ever have a good lead in?
*  Sometimes.
*  One time we were on the Thursday night, which was the big night with Seinfeld and Friends
*  and we crushed it.
*  Yeah, we were like number two in the world.
*  Is that how they launched you or that was after?
*  No, no, no.
*  I don't remember how they launched.
*  I don't remember.
*  But I remember one time we were on Thursday and everybody was so excited.
*  Maybe on Thursday, we'll be right after Caroline and the Shitty.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we used to call it.
*  Remember Caroline and the Shitty?
*  Yeah, right.
*  It was a few of those shows, like the single guy.
*  Like, what is this?
*  And they stayed on forever.
*  Because they were owned by someone, either NBC or someone who had a deal with NBC, Warner
*  Brothers or whoever it was.
*  That's the weird thing about television shows.
*  You can last forever if you have a good lead in and there's someone good after you because
*  people just slack jaw it and keep that TV on.
*  That's how it used to be at least.
*  Now I think that model is kind of out the window.
*  No, now they take that sweet spot after their number one show and they try to launch something.
*  They'll put something they like in there to get it legs and once it's good, they try to
*  create that and want that to be the lead in for another show.
*  It's like baseball, managing baseball.
*  Right.
*  But who the fuck, I mean, like, who's watching TV with commercials now?
*  Like who's sitting there and actually watching TV with commercials?
*  Like, how much time do you have?
*  And do you not know that there are so many shows that you could watch that don't have
*  commercials?
*  And you could just watch those and record that one and then come back and watch it when
*  it doesn't have commercials or fast forward through the commercials.
*  Or just get Hulu.
*  Pay $10 a month and watch the history of television from the pilots.
*  I go back and watch pilots on Hulu.
*  That's the fucking greatest.
*  Dude, the taxi pilot I just watched recently.
*  Taxi, I forgot about taxi.
*  The taxi pilot was so fucking heartwarming.
*  Really?
*  Oh my God.
*  It was about Alex Krieger had a daughter that he hadn't seen.
*  He was estranged from him.
*  He was basically like a deadbeat dad.
*  And it was about him reconnecting with her.
*  And the second half of the episode was all of them in a fucking New York taxi driving
*  down to Florida so he could meet his daughter.
*  Nowadays, it has to be like, all right, what's the simplest, most basic storyline that lets
*  you, you got to get to know each character, each relationship, two or three great act
*  breaks.
*  There's so much criteria that go into the structure of it.
*  There's no room for anything interesting to happen.
*  Where's the diversity?
*  Do you have diversity?
*  Where's the inclusiveness?
*  Inclusivity?
*  What's the message?
*  What's the heart?
*  What's the message?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, you can't just make a whack.
*  Well, you mean you kind of can curb your enthusiasm is still that.
*  HBO.
*  Yeah.
*  But the networks haven't done much.
*  Well, the networks did cool stuff with like The Office.
*  30 Rock was kind of interesting.
*  Well, the dumbest thing in the networks for sure are the presidential debates.
*  The fact that they take these people that are running for the most important job in
*  the fucking known universe and they, we're out of time.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Mr. Senator.
*  Thank you, Mr. Senator.
*  We're out of time.
*  Thank you, Ms. Congresswoman.
*  Thank you.
*  Thank you, Ms. Congresswoman.
*  You're out of time.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You have 80 seconds to just fucking spill out as many words and get your point across
*  and try to go viral.
*  Yeah.
*  And the worst part is then you got like the also rands that are like on the edge of the,
*  they got the last podium on the left.
*  The guy's like the mayor of Dayton and he's trying to get headlines by taking a shot at
*  the real candidates, which just hurts the Democratic Party.
*  Yep.
*  Sure.
*  It just makes the main guy look bad because he's, so they got a winnow down the field.
*  I think a couple of people just dropped out.
*  Beto O'Rourke just dropped out.
*  Shocking.
*  Yeah.
*  I thought that guy had King written all over him.
*  At the beginning.
*  Leader.
*  He's like, I'm not going to walk out of here.
*  He never did.
*  But he was this guy that he got hot from running against, who'd he run against?
*  Ted Cruz in Texas.
*  Texas of all places.
*  He's running against the guy who's a fucking, you know, arch conservative.
*  And he comes out as this bleeding heart liberal and almost wins.
*  And it's like, all of a sudden, Texas is not a red state.
*  It's starting to become like a purple state.
*  Purple's a good word for it.
*  Well, Austin's very weird, right?
*  Austin is this super blue area in a red state.
*  But it's also got a lot of cowboys and guns and barbecue.
*  It's such a great place.
*  Fucking great place.
*  Austin's one of the best places on earth.
*  It really is.
*  And people figured that out too.
*  You go there and the fucking traffic is absurd.
*  You're like, why are you all here?
*  Like, oh, you found out, that's awesome.
*  There's a great place to shoot pool there called the Jackalope.
*  Jack-o-lantern, Jackalope.
*  It's just like, you just go in there and fucking everybody says hi.
*  Hey, you want to shoot a game?
*  Let me buy you a beer.
*  Texas.
*  Great fucking music on the jukebox.
*  And I love that place.
*  Yeah, it's not, well, they're a little, I mean, they're kind of aware that it's supposed
*  to be kind of cool.
*  So they act a little cool.
*  Like, you know, keep Austin weird, those t-shirts.
*  By the way, if you wear one of those fucking t-shirts, those keep Austin weird t-shirts,
*  you're a part of the problem.
*  You're not weird.
*  And if you're selling them, you're a piece of shit.
*  You just, you're fucking it all up.
*  You found this spot, you're fucking doing those Hollywood lights, you know, when they
*  have a premiere.
*  Come on, everybody, here's a spot.
*  Let's come ruin it.
*  Let's make a documentary about why it's cool.
*  When I first started going there, though, man, I was stunned.
*  I was like, what a cool fucking place.
*  People are educated and aware, but also southern.
*  They have a southern accent, a Texas accent, but they're also educated and very friendly
*  and open-minded.
*  It's a very unique place.
*  And great fucking music.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm playing there.
*  I'm going to Cap City soon.
*  Oh, shit.
*  One of my favorite clubs.
*  It's a great club.
*  The only club I did this whole year, like on the road.
*  Oh, no shit, really?
*  Yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I just said I'm going there.
*  I was about four or five months after my special, and I just put together an hour that I could
*  kind of go on the road with.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and I'm like, this is good.
*  Let's go to Cap City.
*  Bang out two shows a night.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  It's just a great place, man.
*  It's a fun place.
*  Like, I've had so much fun there.
*  Like that club is just, it's got fun soaked into the floorboards.
*  You know, it's like just a fun, it's a club where, I mean, so many great comics have performed
*  there, and so they got good taste.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, they curate good shows.
*  I mean, they get, they get all, and all kinds of comedy, like Maria Bamford will be there
*  one week, and the next week it'll be fucking Doug Stanhope or something like that.
*  It's just, you know, they're all over the place.
*  But it's not downtown, though.
*  That's the only thing is you got to take a little Uber into town.
*  It's about five, 10 minutes out.
*  Yeah, but it's, at nighttime, it's fine.
*  The real problem there is rush hour.
*  They have a real rush hour now.
*  Yeah.
*  They didn't have a real rush hour 10 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think that's where you could get around in Austin.
*  It was no issue.
*  I think it's where young kids get out of college now, and when they used to go to San Francisco,
*  now they go to Austin.
*  Yeah, there's a lot of tech startups there.
*  There's a lot of the tech business.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, Onnit's there, too.
*  There's a lot of shit there.
*  Onnit's there?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, no shit.
*  Onnit, Onnit Gym's there as well.
*  The whole, the factory's there.
*  Everything's there.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  You go there much?
*  It's a great place.
*  Not that often.
*  Maybe once a year.
*  No board meetings you have to be at?
*  I'm not a board meeting kind of guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I can picture you at a board meeting.
*  Could you?
*  Stoned.
*  Stoned.
*  Looking at your watch, checking your fucking phone.
*  Checking my Instagram.
*  Let's see if anybody posted a good Epstein didn't kill himself meme.
*  Oh, fucking Epstein.
*  Man, what a story.
*  What a story.
*  So now, what did they say?
*  It looks like he was choked to death?
*  Yeah.
*  His brother hired a real fucking autopsy guy to check it out, including that guy Michael
*  Badden from that HBO autopsy show.
*  That guy said he was murdered.
*  Who dinged?
*  I might have dinged.
*  Do you remember that show, HBO autopsy?
*  No.
*  It was a great show that was on basically pre-internet, where you would watch these wacky fucking stories
*  of people that got busted murdering people by this one really good autopsy coroner.
*  This coroner, Dr. Michael Badden, one of the ones I'll never forget, he took this one lady,
*  he was in love with this lady, and she died.
*  He stole her corpse and had it in his house and put a tube where her vagina was and he
*  had bought cases and cases of perfume because she was rotting in his bed.
*  He would just douse her in perfume and keep fucking her.
*  Wow.
*  Dude.
*  And he put a tube in her vagina so that it didn't collapse?
*  Well he put a tube there so he could fuck the tube.
*  He put a fuckhole in this dead lady's body.
*  Damn.
*  Oh my god, dude.
*  And apparently it was like, the smell was insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Like horrific.
*  And this guy, I think one of the ways they were suspicious, like why is this motherfucker
*  buying cases of perfume?
*  Yeah.
*  He put a mask over her face and just the fact that it used to be her was enough.
*  I forget his deal.
*  I think, I want to say he was a doctor and she was a patient of his and he was in love
*  with her.
*  Huh.
*  Yeah, just some dude who just had a fucking major fuse blow.
*  Yeah.
*  It just goes to show you don't know who it's going to be.
*  It's not just some derelict on the street.
*  It could be your fucking doctor who snaps.
*  Doctors are just humans, man.
*  They're just humans and a lot of them have access to drugs because of the fact that they're
*  doctors.
*  There was a book called Dead Doctors Don't Lie and it was basically the gist of the book
*  was that a lot of people are dealing with mineral deficiencies and that mineral deficiencies
*  were, it's by a guy named Dr. Joel Wallach.
*  It's a controversial book and his ideas are fairly controversial but they're not controversial
*  in the sense that like in animal husbandry, in agriculture, animal agriculture, people
*  are very aware that you need to supplement the diet of a lot of animals with minerals.
*  Like for instance, some of the places where I hunt, they don't bait animals.
*  These are wild animals that are in these giant ranches but when they have, there's a place
*  in Utah that I go to, it's like 270,000 acres.
*  Huge place but every fucking mile or so they scatter, they'll put these mineral licks and
*  it's a mineral lick so that the deer and the elk get minerals in their diet because animals
*  like desperately need minerals and sometimes they don't get enough of it from their diet
*  and particularly from foods where the ground is deficient in minerals.
*  When you, say if you have, if you're growing corn, monocrops is what they call, monocrop
*  agriculture, you're growing corn on like fucking 700 acres, just growing corn.
*  So when they till that land, like every year that land has less minerals.
*  Like you're not supposed to grow the same thing in the same place forever.
*  And the places that are doing it right, they do what's called regenerative agriculture
*  and there's a real good argument for, it's one of the reasons why you, like it's good
*  to raise grass-fed cattle in these areas because the manure from the cattle actually is a great
*  fertilizer, it's good and also scraps from food, fish and different things, you need
*  nitrate, you need nitrogen and nitrogen is very difficult to get when you want to put
*  it into the ground for fertilizer and all these other different minerals.
*  Phosphorus.
*  Yeah, all kinds of shit.
*  Like you have to add that stuff to the soil now because the topsoil has been so eroded
*  from continuous over farming and that his contention was that most of us, even if you're
*  eating like vegetables and you're getting stuff at the grocery store, you're getting
*  things that are minerally deficient, they're not optimally mineralized, if that's a word,
*  I don't think that's a word.
*  So I take colloidal minerals, it's just a liquid form of minerals, like minerals that
*  come from.
*  There's a type of water that's like a very rich mineral water that is called glacial
*  milk and basically what it is is the runoff from glaciers that it carries an incredible
*  amount of minerals in it to the point where the water actually kind of looks kind of milky
*  and you can get that in some places, some places on earth, people, their water actually
*  looks like that because it's got so many minerals in it and these people have like dark hair
*  and you know, health benefits are attributed to that.
*  I'm not smart enough to know whether or not that's accurate, but there's definitely some
*  benefits, some health benefits to taking minerals.
*  Right, people go to mineral spas, I mean it was always the, that was the Miracle Elixir?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Do you take any minerals?
*  I don't take anything.
*  Here, is that glacial milk?
*  Fresh water meets glacial milk in Iceland, look at that.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Damn.
*  So that stuff on the rise is just fucking overwhelmingly packed with minerals.
*  So they just bottle that shit?
*  I think, you know, you probably could get too many minerals too.
*  I mean it's always like the balance.
*  What is a good intake?
*  Like, I don't take shit.
*  I think sometimes I take vitamin D.
*  Vitamin D is good, especially for a white fellow like yourself who doesn't get a lot
*  of sun.
*  You're not getting enough sun, right, right.
*  That's why I take it.
*  That's real good.
*  And that's it.
*  Do you take D3?
*  That's all I take.
*  D3 is very good.
*  I take B, I take D, I take multivitamins.
*  I take what this called, it's a company called Pure, Pure Encapsulations.
*  And they have an athlete pure pack.
*  It's very nice because it's real simple.
*  A little packet I take.
*  Not a sponsor.
*  I take this packet, just bring them with me on the road, open it up and just take those.
*  And then I also take, there's a company called Athletic Greens.
*  And they make a really good supplement that I pour into water.
*  And it's very easy.
*  And it's got a bunch of different shit, vitamins and minerals.
*  That is a sponsor.
*  That's good.
*  That's good too because it's whole food based.
*  It's not, there's nothing synthesized.
*  It's all based on food.
*  But I think you really should take something.
*  You know, I mean, it's so hard to make sure that you're getting all the vitamins that
*  you need from your food, especially when you go on the road.
*  On the road, it's, you know, unless you know you're getting, you're eating in a really
*  good organic restaurant where you're getting high quality vegetables, high quality meat.
*  It's hard.
*  And then the hotels have gotten a lot better, man.
*  In our lifetime, hotel food used to be garbage.
*  How about airport food?
*  Airport food's gotten great.
*  Way better.
*  You got Lemonades in there.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  You can get real food at the airport.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a big issue, man.
*  It's a big issue for people that go on the road.
*  Because, you know, you're on the road like three, four days in a row to eat and fucking
*  jack in the box.
*  You start feeling like shit.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And then if you're, I mean, comedy club food in 50 years has not gotten any better.
*  Deep fried chicken wings and...
*  Except Comedy Magic Club.
*  Comedy Magic's got good club and good food.
*  They give you a fucking serious restaurant steak there.
*  You could go there and eat a legit excellent dinner.
*  Oh, what am I saying?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I've had plenty of dinners there.
*  Very good.
*  Right.
*  They do have good food.
*  Ice House has good burgers too.
*  Yeah.
*  Ice House has very good burgers.
*  Uh-huh.
*  But Comedy Magic Club's probably the tops.
*  That's top.
*  And you know what's good too is Hilarity's in Cleveland.
*  They got the Pickwick and Frolic restaurant upstairs.
*  Yes.
*  I was just there.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  We went to see Jessie Mae.
*  Me and Santino.
*  Jessie Mae was playing at Hilarity's and we were over at, we were at this arena.
*  So we came down and saw Jessie Mae and I had a prime rib.
*  It was fucking great.
*  Yeah.
*  It's good, right?
*  Very good.
*  Very good.
*  Nick Costas got it.
*  Although Santino's got food poisoning.
*  No.
*  Yes he did.
*  Oh boy.
*  Yes he did.
*  We don't know where he got it.
*  I'm assuming it was the vegetables.
*  I mean, that's a lot of times where people get it.
*  You get it from things that aren't washed properly or they sit out.
*  Like they say that a large percentage of food poisoning cases are salad.
*  Yeah, I could see that.
*  Yeah, it's handled wrong, not washed correctly.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, a lot of people when they get E. coli, they get it from salad because of the
*  runoff from animal agriculture, the runoff from the shit, animal shit gets into the water,
*  the water gets into the lettuce or the spinach is a big one.
*  Spinach.
*  Well, that's why if you go to a third world country where you don't trust the water, stay
*  away from the salad.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's the first thing to say is don't eat lettuce in a third world country.
*  Good point.
*  Yeah.
*  Right, like meat is meat.
*  Right.
*  As long as it's seared on the outside, you're golden.
*  Oh yeah, look at Anthony Bardin.
*  He would just go to fucking Vietnam and go to a street meat shop where there's no running
*  water and he'd just gobble down some fucking whatever meat, you didn't even know what meat
*  it was.
*  Well, they used to drink wine when people would travel to prevent travelers illness
*  because they didn't want to drink water because if you drink water, like if you found a fucking
*  pond somewhere and you're trying to suck some water out of it.
*  Yeah.
*  Like back then, it wasn't a lot, I mean you had to boil it, that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Nowadays you can get, they have a bunch of different things you could do to water if
*  you find it.
*  Like you could take water out of a fucking elk wallow.
*  You know what an elk wallow is?
*  No.
*  It's like a puddle that elk piss in and they wallow around in it and they get their scent
*  on it, especially when they're rutting, when they're having sex with the female elk.
*  They get in there and they piss all over the water and they roll around in it and so you
*  get this muddy puddle.
*  And sometimes hikers, like if you're on some serious fucking trek, you know you're doing
*  like the Appalachian Trail or something like that and your water's scarce, you can't find
*  a creek, you got to take the water out of an elk wallow.
*  No shit.
*  I have friends that have done that and you throw it through some filters.
*  What they do is they'll take it and they'll throw it through filters, they'll put it through
*  a biological filter first so there's like a filter that's like a pump.
*  But the problem is those pumps can get clogged up because they're basically taking the sediment
*  and then they're filtering it out and then you get the water afterwards and it still
*  tastes like piss.
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's piss in it, you're drinking piss.
*  Yeah.
*  You're drinking piss that's not contaminated with something that can kill you.
*  Wow.
*  So then a lot of times guys, even after that, they take something called a SteriPen.
*  You ever heard of a SteriPen?
*  Now.
*  Steri, short for sterilization pen and it uses some kind of light.
*  Pull up SteriPen.
*  I don't want to say this wrong.
*  But utilizing some sort of light.
*  Some sort of, I forgot what kind of light.
*  What is it?
*  UV light.
*  UV light.
*  You keep it in the water for a certain amount of time.
*  It just nukes everything.
*  Kills everything.
*  But still.
*  That's amazing.
*  Tastes like piss.
*  So you're drinking piss.
*  Yeah.
*  You're definitely drinking piss.
*  So a lot of times guys will take, like they sell these different, there's a SteriPen.
*  So that little thing with that light is spinning around inside your glass of water and depending
*  upon the amount of ounces, a certain amount of time, but it's not that much time.
*  Shockingly.
*  It's like 10 minutes.
*  Sometimes guys even throw iodine tablets in water.
*  The whole deal is just kill anything that can fuck you up.
*  And just get over the fact that it's going to taste like piss.
*  And then they also take, there's a bunch of companies, there's a company called Mountain
*  Ops.
*  They have stuff that you throw into the water to make the water taste better.
*  I wonder if you drink a glass of that.
*  If you saw a female elk and she started presenting.
*  You'd get hard?
*  You'd get hard as a rock.
*  I think you'd probably want to suck an elk's dick.
*  You'd probably be gay for elk.
*  No, no, it's not gay if it's an animal.
*  It's a male animal.
*  Oh, it's bestiality.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Interesting.
*  Yeah, they should get those into third world countries, some version of that to help people
*  drink water.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, they definitely do.
*  They definitely do get filters and different things like that in certain countries.
*  You know, we're involved with Fight for the Forgotten.
*  It's my good buddy, Justin Wren.
*  He's got a charity where they build wells for the Pygmies in the Congo.
*  And through this podcast and through this company called The Cash App, they've raised
*  thousands and thousands of dollars and built a bunch of wells.
*  And they're in the process of building them now.
*  We've donated a bunch of money to that too.
*  That's amazing.
*  It's very cool.
*  But my point being, this motherfucker was just here last week and he's got a parasite.
*  They can't even identify.
*  And he's had it for six months.
*  And he gets so fucked up, like sometimes he works out and then he gets to the point where
*  his body turns pale and he starts shaking and shivering and they have to get him into
*  a shower.
*  Oh, shit.
*  Dude, they don't even know what it is.
*  Like they think, do you remember what he said it was?
*  They think it was a type of parasite?
*  They've been testing it with Lyme disease recently.
*  Yeah, everything.
*  Quite a few things.
*  Yeah, quite a few things.
*  They have no idea.
*  They think it's in his brain.
*  Whatever it is.
*  Jesus.
*  Yeah.
*  Heavy antibiotics.
*  And of course, one of the things that comes with heavy antibiotics, particularly something
*  called Cipro, is you don't just get sick from that.
*  You also get your ligaments become very, very lax and they get weak.
*  And a lot of people that come off antibiotics for a long period of time, they are subject
*  to injuries.
*  Like athletes, when they get staph infection, they put you on this heavy dose of antibiotics
*  but all your ligaments get weak and then you end up tearing your ACL.
*  He's got both of his shoulders are torn and he thinks it's probably a connection to the
*  antibiotics that he had to take to deal with the staph or to deal with whatever the fuck
*  this infection is that he's got some very, very strange parasite.
*  He goes so deep in the Congo, it might be an unidentified parasite and that's part of
*  the problem.
*  He's basically like a fucking lab rat right now.
*  And he's got malaria three different times.
*  Wow.
*  Not once, not twice.
*  Three times.
*  Fucking malaria.
*  Three times.
*  He didn't take the anti-malarial stuff?
*  It's still got it.
*  Well, one of the things he got it and then he said the anti-malaria shit is so bad and
*  it's so rough on you that some people would prefer to get malaria and get it treated.
*  And what was the stuff that he said that you get there's a toxic sickness that he got from
*  malodorn, what the fuck was it called?
*  I'm trying to think of that word for like two minutes.
*  Malodium?
*  Malodium?
*  I can pull it up.
*  There's a type of anti-malaria medication that they give to, particularly to soldiers,
*  and they find that these guys, it's fucking incredibly toxic.
*  And they found it in his brain.
*  They found that he's suffering from poisoning from this anti-malaria medication.
*  Wow.
*  And he was on like really high doses of this shit too.
*  If you live somewhere like that, you're supposed to be taking it all the time, constantly.
*  What the fuck?
*  You know, when they built the...
*  Malodium?
*  What the fuck?
*  The Panama Canal, they went down there.
*  The French tried to dig it for like 50 fucking years and they were dropping like flies from
*  the malaria.
*  They didn't know it was from malaria.
*  They had no idea what was going on.
*  They just knew people were getting sick while they were trying to...
*  I mean, the scope of that project at that time was insane.
*  I mean, they were hand digging a fucking...
*  Canal.
*  Canal from...
*  I mean, through like thick jungle.
*  In the middle of the country.
*  In the middle of the country.
*  And they were just...
*  People were getting sick and then they would...
*  And eventually France after 50 years said, fuck it.
*  And then they just left.
*  And then for some reason we bought it and we're like, we can do it.
*  So we went down there.
*  Meth-lo-queen.
*  Meth-lo-queen?
*  Meth-lo-queen?
*  That sounds like a queef.
*  She metho-cleaned.
*  So we show up and they realize...
*  But spell it out.
*  Put it up there again so we could...
*  A mello-queen.
*  Meth-lo-queen.
*  Sold under the brand names Larium.
*  That's what I've heard.
*  I've heard medication to prevent or treat malaria.
*  It's used to start a potential exposure and continue for several weeks after potential
*  exposure and then people get sick off of that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  That's definitely it?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  All right.
*  Seems wrong.
*  Like the name seems wrong, doesn't it?
*  That's what I looked up.
*  I know, but does it seem right to you?
*  It seems wrong to me.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm sure it's right, but it just...
*  So we go in and some genius goes, it's the fucking mosquitoes.
*  We're getting an infection from the mosquitoes.
*  So they've simply got rid of standing water.
*  They just started finding...
*  They had teams of people every day would go out and they'd find puddles and they would
*  get rid of the puddles and they went from going like...
*  I'm telling you, one out of three people was dying trying to dig this tunnel and they went
*  to almost nobody dying.
*  Do you know malaria has killed some insane number of people?
*  We looked it up once.
*  I think the rumor is that it's killed half the people who have ever died.
*  Ever.
*  Oh shit.
*  Have been killed by malaria.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  That was what I had heard.
*  I think it's less than that, that they can definitely determine was killed by malaria.
*  But nevertheless, it's a staggering number of humans.
*  Those little dirty mosquitoes.
*  I think we can get rid of them, right?
*  Yeah, they're trying to do that.
*  They're trying to genetically engineer mosquitoes that don't carry malaria.
*  And then they're also thinking that, you know, and this is really dangerous, really dangerous,
*  that they could just get rid of mosquitoes, period.
*  But the problem with that is, man, you don't know how all that shit's connected.
*  What happens if you get rid of mosquitoes?
*  The beetles take over?
*  The beetles start carrying diseases?
*  They start biting people?
*  What morphs?
*  A mosquito wasn't always a mosquito.
*  This must be understood.
*  A mosquito at one point in time was a single-celled organism, just like us.
*  And then it became a mosquito and found a really good niche.
*  It's like this fucking mosquito business is the shit.
*  It's like fast food.
*  You can't go wrong.
*  Mosquito business is awesome.
*  Sure.
*  They fucking go crazy.
*  Yeah, all they need is a little bit of water and any living thing that they can take a
*  little fucking drop of blood from.
*  Did you ever go to my, when I rented a house in Encino, did you ever go to that place?
*  I don't think so.
*  I think it was before you moved out here.
*  But when I first moved out here, I rented this house in Encino and nobody had lived
*  in it for a couple of years.
*  And the fucking pool had not been taken care of.
*  So the pool was green, like the Hulk's dick.
*  And I looked in the pool and it was little things were swimming, like schools of fish.
*  And I was like, what the fuck is this?
*  And the pool guy goes, oh bro, that's mosquito larva.
*  I was like, what?
*  And he goes, yeah.
*  He goes, we got to kill this now before you literally infect the entire neighborhood with
*  mosquitoes.
*  There was fish.
*  No shit.
*  Like swimming.
*  Whoa.
*  Dude, like filled with mosquitoes.
*  Have you ever seen mosquito larvae in a pool?
*  It was so disturbing.
*  I was like, I got to get a hotel.
*  He's like, no, no, no, we can kill it.
*  We can kill it.
*  But they had a poor like fuck.
*  They drain the entire pool and poured gallons and gallons of poison in there.
*  They just filled and I couldn't swim in it for like six months or something.
*  I don't remember what it was, but it was so nasty.
*  You could see these little fuckers swimming like schools of fish.
*  That's amazing.
*  Like little schools swimming around there.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Standing water, man.
*  That's all it takes.
*  That's why you got to have a fountain.
*  You have little fucking bubbles running through it.
*  We are so, so lucky when it comes to bugs out here though.
*  I know.
*  We got no bugs.
*  No bugs.
*  Well, we got termites.
*  That's the only thing that they're fucking insidious.
*  Yeah, they're gross.
*  Like we built a fence around our house, took like six weeks.
*  They put it in and six months later, there's fucking like little, you never see shavings
*  from that powder on the bottom.
*  I'm like, you motherfuckers brought termite infested wood to my house and now it's in
*  my house also.
*  The wood had termites in it?
*  Can you sue?
*  I probably, I'm not really a sewer.
*  What are you?
*  You plot revenge?
*  Just a guy who gets sad when things happen.
*  Silent revenge.
*  Don't say that.
*  I'm Irish.
*  Silent revenge.
*  Yeah.
*  Ravenga.
*  I'm an arsonist.
*  I find the next project he's going to do, take it down.
*  So they brought wood that had termites in it.
*  Yeah.
*  For sure?
*  Well, the wood had fucking termites in it immediately.
*  Did you contact the contractor?
*  I don't even remember.
*  This was like 15 years ago.
*  Is the fence still there?
*  Yeah, but it's like I tried to screw something into it the other day and it wouldn't hold
*  the fucking screw.
*  It's like powder underneath.
*  The whole thing needs to be ripped down.
*  You could run through that fence like the Hulk.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  We're not keeping anybody out.
*  The high sea guy and the Hulk meeting at my house.
*  The Kool-Aid guy, right?
*  Hey Kool-Aid, remember that?
*  Yeah.
*  What happened to the Kool-Aid guy?
*  They just stopped that campaign.
*  That was a huge campaign.
*  He ran through the fucking house everywhere.
*  Kids were just sitting there, boy, I'm thirsty.
*  Boom.
*  A fucking giant pitcher.
*  Kool-Aid guy shows up.
*  Yeah.
*  A pitcher with a face on it.
*  Runs right through your house.
*  You kids want a fucking bucket of sugar with some water in it?
*  Boy, was that delicious though.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Kool-Aid, a couple years ago, I ate at this place in, what's that shitty town in California?
*  Fresno.
*  There's a place called, god damn it, I follow them on Instagram.
*  It's a soul food place in Fresno.
*  Trying to remember.
*  Paul's Kitchen.
*  Is that it?
*  Chef Paul's.
*  Chef Paul's.
*  Chef Paul's Cafe.
*  Dude.
*  You know, sometimes you're in the road, you find a place that's just fucking off the charts
*  good.
*  If you're in Fresno, ladies and gentlemen, Chef Paul's Cafe, I fucking give it two thumbs
*  up.
*  No shit.
*  Five stars.
*  Full on soul food.
*  Like fucking collard greens, oxtails, like phenomenal food.
*  And they also had Kool-Aid.
*  I was like, okay, well obviously I'm going all in.
*  I gotta get the Kool-Aid too.
*  I hadn't had Kool-Aid in probably a decade.
*  Is that a soul food thing, Kool-Aid?
*  I don't know.
*  It was their menu thing.
*  They had a bunch of crazy shit on the menu.
*  That's it right there.
*  But, you know, it's a great restaurant in a sketchy town.
*  Fresno's sketchy as fuck.
*  I mean, you got like, we were driving down the street, there's homeless communities,
*  skid roast.
*  Look at that food, dude.
*  Seriously.
*  Chicken and waffles.
*  Oh my god.
*  Their food is so good.
*  Their fried chicken's off the charts.
*  But the oxtail, I had oxtail.
*  There's chicken and waffles.
*  Oh, that looks good.
*  It's so good, man.
*  That place is amazing.
*  And it's just super, super authentic, like down home, like real hearty comfort food.
*  There's that Kool-Aid right there, baby.
*  Kool-Aid on the menu.
*  I mean, why not, man?
*  Just get all the flavors when you're at a place like that.
*  Don't drink water, you asshole.
*  Get all the flavors.
*  Get yourself some Kool-Aid too.
*  Get yourself some Kool-Aid too.
*  But that's what Red Bull is, isn't it?
*  It's just Kool-Aid.
*  Red Bull has taurine in it.
*  And taurine is actually originally from bull cum.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Taurine is a stimulant that's derived from bull jizz.
*  And Hitler used to actually take bull cum.
*  I think I found that out from Tom Papa.
*  Is that who told me?
*  Wow.
*  Someone told me that.
*  And we Googled it.
*  I was like, what?
*  Like, they figured out a way to synthesize it.
*  But taurine is one of the actual ingredients in bull jizz.
*  Damn.
*  So, Hitler used to take bull jizz as some sort of a stimulant, I guess.
*  Here it is.
*  Heil Hitler!
*  Oh, hi Hitler.
*  Medical record show, Fuhrer Adolf was a cocaine addict and was injected with bull semen to
*  help his sex life.
*  He also took steroids.
*  He took a lot of testosterone.
*  He suffered from flatulence.
*  Known to break wind during meals with his generals.
*  Oh, they all ratted him out.
*  I wonder if you say to a guy who's killing millions of Jews, that was offensive.
*  That smell was offensive.
*  Your farts are worse than what you've done to the Jews.
*  Right, you gas them, you're gassing us now.
*  Well, he was a vegetarian too.
*  Was he?
*  Yeah.
*  You eat a lot of vegetables.
*  That's the gas.
*  Broccoli farts.
*  They're famous.
*  Because your body's breaking down all that fiber.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it has something to do also with the vegetables are breaking down faster than the
*  meat.
*  If you eat meat and vegetables and they get caught in your intestine, that's why you
*  get pockets of gas.
*  The meat's blocking it up.
*  Fermenting.
*  Yeah.
*  Steaming up, creating gas.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, I've been farting.
*  Phenomenal.
*  I enjoy farting.
*  Do you?
*  And my wife laughs at it.
*  Thank God.
*  We wouldn't still be together.
*  You fart in front of her?
*  Oh yeah.
*  You don't even let her know it's coming?
*  No, it's a, it's a, it's, I will walk in the room with a fart because she laughs at it.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  She thinks it's funny every fucking time I fart.
*  She's like a guy.
*  Yeah.
*  She is.
*  But when she farts, she wishes she could fart as much as I do, but when she does she lets
*  me know.
*  Our family does.
*  The whole family farts?
*  Son farts at the dinner table.
*  We all laugh.
*  Yeah.
*  We're very open about it.
*  But do you think that that's going to carry on to his next relationship?
*  I hope so.
*  I hope so too, but it's hard to find a gal that's down with that.
*  I think you gotta make him down with it.
*  You ease him in.
*  You start with a little one and then gently you just, you know.
*  If they smell you take it in the other room, but if it's just a...
*  When you know your cycle, you usually know what's in the tank based on the previous ones.
*  Sometimes you don't.
*  Sometimes you think you're floating an air biscuit and you let out a bomb.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Whenever I'm getting on a plane I try to get a few out before I get on the plane when I'm
*  on that ramp.
*  You know what's weird?
*  This is really strange.
*  I mean really strange and not a lot of people are aware of this.
*  When you are around certain smells, like if you're, like say if you're butchering an
*  animal, okay.
*  Say if you shot an animal in the field and you're hunting and you cut it up and you...
*  The smells that come from that animal will be in your farts even if you don't eat it.
*  Wow.
*  It's weird.
*  Oh shit.
*  It's weird.
*  And I had recognized this, but I was confused by it.
*  And then it was brought up to me by friends that are hunting guides in Alberta.
*  My friends John and Jen, the Rivets, they've got this guide service and one of the things
*  they hunt is bears.
*  And bear is delicious, but you have to cook it right because you can get trichinosis.
*  It's like pork, same kind of deal.
*  But they smell.
*  Like their guts and like when you're butchering them, like a lot of times people use what's
*  called the gutless method.
*  It means you take all the meat out without opening up the gut cavity because if you do
*  get that stuff on you, like specifically if they've been eating something that's rotten,
*  the smell's horrible.
*  That smell comes out in your farts.
*  And one of their daughters canceled school.
*  She stayed home because she was farting so bad.
*  She was like, I can't go to school farting like this.
*  I will be a pariah.
*  But I've smelt it before.
*  Did you have bear?
*  Yeah, like if I've shot a deer in the field and it's called quartering it, you gut it,
*  you take out the heart and the liver, you eat the heart and the liver, you quarter it,
*  you take like the limbs off, you take like the legs off and you take the meat off the
*  back, it's called the back straps and the tenderloins, you take all that stuff off.
*  And then when you fart, you fucking smell that animal in your farts.
*  This was addressed actually by my friend Steve Rinella on the show Meat Eater.
*  They were trying to figure out why.
*  They're like, okay, this is a real thing, right?
*  Everybody talks about this.
*  How is it getting in you?
*  You're smelling it and then somehow or another those molecules come out, go all the way through
*  your body from you smelling it and breathing in that air and comes out in your farts and
*  you smell this horrific gut smell.
*  This is like a good game show.
*  You know, you go into a room and you come out and the contestants have to guess what
*  animal you just quartered.
*  Lamb!
*  I wonder if that's the case with, I mean, it must be the case with fish too.
*  Like you catch a bunch of fish, you gut them and then you probably smell fish farts when
*  you're farting.
*  You probably smell like fish.
*  But the weird thing is it would make sense if you were eating it, right?
*  If you cooked it and ate it, that would make sense.
*  But this is, I'm telling you, this is farting when you've had none of it yet.
*  You haven't eaten any of it, but you fart and you smell it.
*  I think I fart, I think you fart from getting nervous also.
*  Like if you're a nervous person, I think you fart a lot.
*  That makes sense, right?
*  Your gut starts building all the juices and stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Here it is.
*  Farts can fight strokes, heart attacks and dementia, scientifically.
*  That's fantastic.
*  Her farts.
*  That girl, she farts in your face.
*  You don't get a heart attack.
*  They always get a hot chick in the picture.
*  Somebody has proven that farts can help your cells to live.
*  What?
*  What?
*  Yeah, it's sulfur, what is it?
*  Hydrogen sulfide is well known as a pungent foul smelling gas in rotten eggs and flatulence.
*  It is naturally produced in the body and could in fact be a healthcare hero with significant
*  implications for future therapies for a variety of diseases.
*  Can you imagine if all those weirdos that pay women to fart in their face, if they're
*  onto something.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Right, those women are heroes.
*  Those are the most confusing porn videos.
*  I've never seen that.
*  Where guys are like laying there and girls are like, you like to fart, you dirty bitch.
*  And they fart in their face.
*  Yeah, mommy, give me that fart, mommy.
*  And they fart in their face.
*  Oh, it's so fucking, it's so confusing.
*  It makes me shut my laptop and walk around the block.
*  That's fucking great.
*  I've seen a bunch of those.
*  You never seen one of those?
*  No, I've never seen it.
*  I'm just trying to figure out who the first guy was that had the balls to just go, like
*  smelling a fart and going, I think this is it.
*  I think this is my, you know, for some people it's feet, you know?
*  Yeah, right.
*  Some people it's farts.
*  Wow.
*  That's a thing with guys.
*  Farting in the face.
*  Some people like a lot of weird shit.
*  Like I had this girl on the podcast back in the day, it actually made me sad talking to
*  her.
*  I remember her because like I was like, what?
*  She's selling her piss.
*  She sells like toenail clippings, dirty socks, dirty underwear, all these guys.
*  And then she humiliates these guys.
*  They want her to humiliate them.
*  And the worst she treats them.
*  She's what I believe she refers to, and she's a very smart girl, very pretty too.
*  She refers to herself as a humiliatrix.
*  Like it's like, that's her business.
*  Like she bought a fucking house.
*  She's wealthy because of getting these guys to buy her shit and piss.
*  Very strange.
*  I think I got a new nickname for my wife.
*  Humiliatrix.
*  But I met this prostitute in Lake Tahoe.
*  She had come to my show and she was like, you know, in Nevada, it's all legal.
*  And so I go, what's the weirdest client that you ever had?
*  And she goes, well, I don't know if you're ready for this, but I met this guy and he
*  lived in Colorado and he had been in Nevada.
*  Liked her.
*  She said she's up for anything.
*  Sends a jet to take her to Colorado.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  They go to Denver to some five-star hotel, come up to the suite, presidential suite,
*  they come in, she's like, I have no idea what this is about.
*  And he goes, now this is going to be weird, but it's not going to hurt you.
*  Just go with it.
*  Room service shows up.
*  The guy's got a tray.
*  He's got four plates of hamburger meat, uncooked, just hamburger meat.
*  Tips the guy, he leaves and he says, what I want you to do is take this meat.
*  I'm going to get naked and you're going to take handfuls of it and shove it up my ass.
*  I didn't think it was going there.
*  Five pounds of hamburger meat.
*  Oh!
*  She stood there and she kept stuffing it up, stuffing it up.
*  No erection, no sex, no touching her.
*  And then back on the jet, back to Nevada.
*  So he's a wealthy guy.
*  He paid her a ton of money.
*  Oh my God.
*  I'm surprised, but I'm not surprised.
*  Like if you said, would you bet your life that there's a guy out there that sent a private
*  jet to get a prostitute and take her to a nice restaurant and then paid her to stuff
*  hamburger meat up his ass.
*  If you're wrong, you die.
*  I go, yeah, probably happened.
*  Right?
*  Right.
*  A million monkeys typing, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm not, I'm surprised, but I'm not stunned.
*  I'm not like, no way.
*  I don't believe that.
*  Yeah.
*  I believe it.
*  And the funny thing is like, I don't get the sense this guy is on a chat room talking to
*  other guys that stuff ground beef up their asses.
*  This is his thing.
*  Right.
*  That's his, yeah, that's a personal thing.
*  He's got so much fucking money that his mind just goes to places and he can indulge it.
*  He can just go, yeah, I'll try that.
*  What the fuck, man?
*  And talk about getting diseases.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well there's just an outbreak of, is it salmonella?
*  Yeah, from ground beef.
*  I think someone died.
*  One person died.
*  A few other people have been, they've been recalled.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, you can get salmonella, anally.
*  For sure.
*  It's raw.
*  You gotta tell your doctor.
*  Fucking A. What happened?
*  Well, have a seat.
*  Let's start from the beginning.
*  When I was a boy, first time, started getting hard-ons.
*  I sat on a cheeseburger.
*  And, do you think these guys exist?
*  If I shove solid food up my butt, would I gain any nutrition from it?
*  First of all, here's the thing.
*  He's answered by Andrew Lee, doctor of acupuncture.
*  Hey, fuck face, you didn't go to medical school.
*  Stop calling yourself a doctor.
*  Doctor of acupuncture is so weird.
*  It's like, I'm a doctor of comedy.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You practice acupuncture, you're not a doctor.
*  They don't go to medical school.
*  Did you know that?
*  I didn't know that.
*  Doctors are doctors.
*  A doctor goes to a medical school.
*  It's hard.
*  You have to study.
*  You have to do your residency.
*  You have to get your fucking degree at a medical school.
*  Not chiropractors.
*  They call themselves doctors.
*  Yeah.
*  But they don't go to medical school.
*  At all.
*  Right.
*  At all.
*  And they can fuck you up.
*  They do those cracks on your neck.
*  Oh!
*  Pull that up so we can read that.
*  So, answer is, things can be absorbed through the membrane.
*  Through membrane, what?
*  See, this is how...
*  It's not really an answer.
*  I was just showing you that people have asked this.
*  No, I'm saying, but listen to the way he writes the answer.
*  This is how a chiropractor writes it versus a real doctor.
*  Things that can be absorbed through membrane will bypass the liver when taken through the
*  anus.
*  Through membrane will bypass the liver.
*  Through a membrane?
*  Okay.
*  For example, various drugs can be taken as through the anus in order to be easier on
*  the liver.
*  This is how chiropractors write.
*  See how he's writing?
*  This is not a guy who went to medical school.
*  As the liver no longer needs to filter the drug, which makes the drug half as potent,
*  and is also hard on the liver.
*  This guy's Asian.
*  How do you know that?
*  What's his name?
*  Andrew Lee.
*  How dare you?
*  I did not know his name when I said he's Asian.
*  I didn't know.
*  I could tell by the way he was writing.
*  Alcohol can cross the cell membrane and thus absorbs very easily into the human body.
*  Oh, how about this?
*  My friend, his wife is a school teacher in Utah, and they have a problem in middle school
*  because kids are taking tampons and they're soaking them in rubbing alcohol and stuffing
*  them up their assholes.
*  And they're getting high.
*  Really?
*  Yes.
*  Wow.
*  And one kid found out about it, a bunch of other kids did it, and so they had a problem
*  in their fucking school.
*  Where kids were putting tampons, dipping them in rubbing alcohol and stuffing them up their
*  butt.
*  Shout out to my friend Huey.
*  And by the way, I don't know how many millions of listeners you have.
*  How many people are now going to do that?
*  A lot.
*  40.
*  40?
*  40 people.
*  It's been going on for a while.
*  Yeah, apparently.
*  It's been going on for a while.
*  Three weeks ago.
*  I bet it feels good.
*  Nice and cool.
*  Define feels good.
*  Tingle a little bit.
*  What if you got a hemorrhoid though?
*  Yikes!
*  I'm sure people like that.
*  I'm sure there's people that cut themselves and pour alcohol on it just to feel a sting.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm a piece of shit.
*  Cut.
*  Yeah.
*  The definition of a drunk asshole.
*  Don't be a drunk asshole.
*  Especially when you're 12.
*  You're fucking middle school.
*  They're fucking Mormons probably.
*  They're so desperate.
*  That's a good point.
*  Maybe.
*  We're talking Utah.
*  Remember Kitty Dukakis?
*  She was sober.
*  She was drinking aftershave, right?
*  Something like that.
*  She was drunk aftershave, isopropyl.
*  Yeah.
*  That sunk his...
*  Well, he kind of was on the way out anyway.
*  It was that and when he sat on a tank with a helmet on.
*  Yeah, that was...
*  And people were like, what?
*  Are you a soldier?
*  Are you in war?
*  Why do you have a helmet?
*  Yeah.
*  We're not even at war, you piece of shit.
*  Right, right.
*  Mike Dukakis.
*  Remember him?
*  He was like...
*  Who did he run against?
*  I want to say Bush Sr.?
*  Bush Sr.?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that was a landslide.
*  Yeah, people weren't down with that.
*  It's interesting how some things sink some people.
*  That Howard Dover guy has got to be so fucking confused that Donald Trump got away with that
*  grab him by the pussy thing when all he did was scream.
*  Remember that guy?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Dean.
*  We're going to Arkansas, then we're going to Detroit.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  There he is.
*  I know.
*  Mike Dukakis.
*  It sunk him.
*  Sunk him.
*  Fuck.
*  Look, he had his helmet on.
*  He was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  He was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  He was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  He was like, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
*  He had his helmet with a fucking sticker on.
*  That probably sunk him, too.
*  Why does it say, oh, Mike Dukakis and your helmet, bro.
*  Are you going to go fight for our country?
*  Get out of here, son.
*  Look at him now.
*  You see the picture of him now.
*  Hammered.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at him.
*  He's like, I was almost president.
*  Go to the one picture above that with the red face.
*  Look at that.
*  I was fucking president.
*  That guy is like, if we did a gig for Dick Daugherty in New Hampshire, that guy would
*  be at the bar.
*  Hey, you fucking guys.
*  It's funny, but you know, I was almost president.
*  I was almost president.
*  My wife, my fucking wife, she was drinking a rubber knuckle on this after shave.
*  And after shave, fucking this is aquavelva.
*  My fucking wife was drinking aquavelva.
*  This fucking sunk me.
*  Bitch sunk me.
*  He had a thick head of hair, though.
*  Yeah.
*  Oof.
*  Was he the governor?
*  I believe he was.
*  Yeah, he was the governor.
*  I believe he was the governor of Massachusetts.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Weld?
*  Is it Weld?
*  Or maybe, that's a while ago.
*  He's a Republican, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's unusual, right?
*  We've had a couple of Massachusetts Republicans, like Fuckface, the Mormon.
*  What's his name?
*  Romney?
*  Yeah.
*  Mitt Romney.
*  Yeah, Mitt Romney.
*  Fuckface.
*  Charlie Baker, Republican.
*  He's a Republican, too.
*  That's interesting.
*  That is interesting.
*  Well, you were talking about Texas and Austin.
*  Yeah.
*  Massachusetts is a Republican state.
*  Boston is a Democratic city, but it's such a big part of the state that it's like what
*  Austin is to Texas, and also like Minneapolis to Minnesota.
*  Yeah, I guess so, huh?
*  Where would you think the Republicans are in Massachusetts?
*  Everywhere outside of Boston?
*  Well, I think it's a lot of defense contracts.
*  There's a lot of defense money there.
*  Boston Dynamics, right?
*  Right.
*  I got tricked.
*  They tricked me.
*  They did?
*  I posted one video, it's Boston Dynamics.
*  They wrote B-O-S-S-T-O-L Dynamics, and it was a video of like robots shooting guns,
*  and they're kicking the robots, and it's hitting these targets perfectly every time.
*  I'm like, oh my God, we're fucked.
*  But the thing is, it's not that far removed from what the Boston Dynamics robots already
*  do.
*  Those fucking robots are already doing back flips.
*  They do back flips.
*  Yeah.
*  They do like parkour.
*  They run and jump off things, and hang on things.
*  And then this one was a fake video, though.
*  Was it CGI, I think?
*  Yeah, those guys have, that's what they do on YouTube.
*  How do you trust anything anymore?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Well, we're pretty close to not being able to trust anything anymore.
*  Because with those deep fake generators, where they could take you, like they've already
*  done videos with me where they have audio of me saying shit that I would say, like a
*  bunch of shit that I would say, but I never said it, about like champ armies and all these
*  different things.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's a whole website dedicated to that.
*  It's just weird, man.
*  And it's going to get weirder and weirder with the stuff that they can do with your,
*  you've seen Kyle Dunnigan's fucking page.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  And his, the stuff that he does that's my favorite, that's really, really funny, is
*  the stuff that looks fake.
*  It's like he does the face swap shit from like the Instagram filters or Snapchat or
*  whatever it is.
*  He did a bunch of stuff because he was doing a pilot for Comedy Central and thank God they're
*  too fucking stupid to pick it up because they would have ruined it.
*  Because he was showing me one that they wouldn't do.
*  It was Caitlyn Jenner having sex with Trump.
*  He was showing it to me.
*  I was crying.
*  I was in the green room crying.
*  He goes, yeah, Comedy Central said no to that one.
*  I'm like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  Like what?
*  They're like, no, it was too edgy.
*  Yeah.
*  They wouldn't get involved in anything trans.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Right, right.
*  I'm like, come on.
*  That's why I was shocked that on the roast that she came out and said the shit that she
*  did.
*  That was, excuse the pun, but that was ballsy.
*  What did she say?
*  I think she still has her balls.
*  She said she still has her dick too.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah.
*  What did she say?
*  She came out and said...
*  I love that expression.
*  She has her dick.
*  Welcome to 2019.
*  Yeah.
*  But, Dunnigan, I did a show with him on Saturday night and he came out on stage and he put
*  a laptop in front of his face and there was a big screen and he was doing the characters
*  for the crowd that he usually does like as Instagram posts.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I've heard he does that.
*  Yeah, it was great.
*  How does he do that?
*  He just has the video plays?
*  I guess the computer is videotaping him and sending it...
*  I know it ran through the house, through something in the house system, because it was a fuckup.
*  It got fucked up.
*  Oh.
*  But it still worked.
*  Because he was...
*  We were doing a gig at the store on a Friday night and he was supposed to be on right before
*  me, but they were like, actually, let's have Kyle go on after you because apparently his
*  whole thing needs a big setup.
*  Confirms gender reassignment study.
*  What?
*  She confirms gender reassignment...
*  Hold on.
*  Put that back up.
*  Says, Caitlyn Jenner confirms gender reassignment surgery in 2020 interview.
*  But the problem is she just did an interview recently.
*  She still has it.
*  What is gender reassignment surgery?
*  They fucking wave a wand over you like they knight you.
*  I hereby announce you have a vagina.
*  I have a vagina.
*  Yes.
*  Arise.
*  You now have a vagina.
*  Okay.
*  I mean, look...
*  And they're tapping you on the head with your penis.
*  If you're clearly a man and you could just say you're a woman, why can't you say you
*  have a vagina?
*  We're going to play make believe.
*  Let's just play make believe all the way.
*  Because look, my friend Zuby, he was a guest on the podcast.
*  He claimed he was a woman for a day and broke the women's world record in deadlift.
*  What did he have to do to qualify as a woman?
*  You don't have to do anything.
*  You just say it.
*  He didn't identify as a woman.
*  I mean, who are you to say that he didn't identify as a woman, you fucking transphobic
*  piece of shit?
*  I know.
*  I feel bad now.
*  You should.
*  Jesus Christ, Greg.
*  All these years we've known each other.
*  I believe.
*  I didn't know that you have this in you.
*  This is my childhood.
*  I think you're canceled.
*  I'm canceled.
*  I wish I was big enough to get canceled.
*  I got to get a little bit more famous.
*  And then it can happen.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm more like me who?
*  That's like a Tony Hinchcliffe joke.
*  That was such a pun.
*  Oh, God.
*  Now I think...
*  Pull up.
*  I think that Caitlyn Jenner still has his dick.
*  Her dick.
*  Was there a fight with a guy that became a woman and then beat the shit out of a woman?
*  You mean MMA?
*  I don't know if it was boxing or MMA.
*  Yeah, she had a few fights.
*  The problem was not that she had the fights, which I would never advise anybody to fight
*  someone who used to be a man.
*  I would say, ooh, probably got a lot of physical advantages that's not going to show up in
*  the weight class.
*  Just because you're both 135 pounds, there's a fucking difference.
*  I don't give a shit what anybody says.
*  There's a reason why this woman world champion cyclist is breaking records.
*  Women deadlift.
*  These women weightlifters who used to be men are breaking records by giant numbers.
*  I mean, giant numbers in powerlifting.
*  And all they have to do is just say they used to be a man and now I'm a woman.
*  This is it.
*  Oh, she's a woman.
*  You're a piece of shit if you say anything different.
*  This one was fighting, her name's Fallon Fox, and she was fighting as a woman, even though
*  she'd been a man for 30 plus years and in fact even had kids at a kid.
*  Then just transitioned, became a woman, didn't tell anybody, said it was a medical issue.
*  It's none of your business.
*  And then beat the fuck out of two women and beat them like domestic violence.
*  You watch it, you're like, what?
*  Then she came out and then it was like this big hubbub.
*  I got caught up in it because I said it was nonsense.
*  I said it's worse than nonsense.
*  I'm just like, it's bullshit.
*  It's 100% bullshit.
*  And I've never, never been attacked harder.
*  Oh, I shouldn't have brought it up.
*  I didn't realize.
*  No, no, I don't care.
*  It's fine.
*  Look, that's a hill I'll die on.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a hill I'll die on.
*  You guys are out of your fucking mind.
*  I think you're out of your mind with track and field.
*  I think you're out of your mind with weightlifting.
*  You're out of your mind with all those things.
*  But if it comes to fighting, fuck you.
*  Fuck you.
*  You think a man or a woman are the same thing.
*  You are out of your goddamn mind.
*  If you think all you have to do is get a little bit of surgery, take some hormones, and you're
*  a woman now and you should be able to fight women.
*  Imagine if that's your daughter and your daughter is getting pummeled by someone who used to
*  be a man.
*  Fuck you.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's crazy.
*  Well, it's unfair to the female athletes.
*  It's women.
*  Real women.
*  Real women are getting fucked over.
*  Real women are training their whole fucking lives.
*  They're sacrificing to be the best woman out there and then to compete against somebody
*  who's got testosterone that just puts them at a whole different level physically.
*  Well here's the deal.
*  I know it lowers the testosterone, but it's still there.
*  It doesn't.
*  No, it lowers it significantly.
*  But the gains that they've had through growing up through puberty with testosterone and being
*  an XY chromosome, having the bone structure of a man, those are undeniable.
*  And they're undeniable by the world records that these trans women are winning.
*  They're beating men.
*  I mean, they're beating women, biological women, by giant numbers.
*  Someone sent me this.
*  The states that allow people in college and in high school to compete as the gender that
*  they identify with.
*  Without surgery or drugs.
*  You don't even have to.
*  You don't even have to have surgery in a lot of these places.
*  They are dominating.
*  Dominating.
*  It's dominant.
*  Trans people.
*  Trans people are winning these things.
*  Always, always male to female.
*  Never female to male.
*  Female to male, it's not like no chicks are like saying, identify as a man, let me get
*  in the NBA and fucking post it up at 40 against LeBron.
*  That's not happening.
*  It doesn't go down that way.
*  What goes down is men who want to be a woman become a woman and then want to compete against
*  biological women.
*  In every single case, the biological women are getting fucked over.
*  Because if a woman, say if a woman was 30 years old and she decided at 30 years old
*  she was going to start taking hormones and become a man and compete against men, she
*  would be fucked.
*  If a man does that, he's got the benefit of having testosterone in his system for 30 years
*  and then transition and becomes a woman.
*  There's no denying there's a gigantic advantage.
*  If a woman was going to compete, say if she's going to compete in track and field and she's
*  30 years old, but for all of her life she's been taking steroids, her whole life she's
*  been taking just steroids.
*  Get a man jaw and a thick neck and fucking shoulders.
*  And then she gets off of it.
*  Just gets off of it for a couple years and competes against women.
*  Just throwing them around, ragged on them.
*  People will be like, she's a cheater.
*  She cheated.
*  She took steroids for 30 years.
*  Just because she's not taking them now doesn't mean she's not a cheater.
*  Well that's what's happening.
*  But it's worse because the bone structure and because it's a natural testosterone.
*  You're fucking puberty.
*  You're going through puberty with testosterone.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's fucking crazy.
*  And it's almost even crazier if you didn't go through puberty.
*  So how about if you're a trans person and someone decided when you're five or six years
*  old that you're trans.
*  And so now someone's transitioning you before.
*  I mean somebody had a great joke about that.
*  You don't let a five year old pick their outfit.
*  Why would you let them pick their gender?
*  You can't let a kid say what they are and what they aren't.
*  Kids are a giant part of what a kid is, is you're so easily influenced by your environment.
*  So easily influenced.
*  It's so easy to convince a kid one way or the other and you don't know what's happening
*  in their home.
*  And you're asking this child to make a decision about their biology.
*  You're talking about in terms of starting to take drugs.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean the idea of doing that to a little kid to me is fucking bananas.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  So we're really in this weird fantasy world right now where people want to be so progressive
*  and they want to be so open minded and they don't want to be transphobic.
*  So we're letting people say and do absolutely preposterous things that don't have any logic,
*  that don't make any sense in terms of what we know about biology.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  And particularly when it comes to sports, particularly when it comes to your life, you're
*  a grown adult.
*  I don't care.
*  I'm happy for you.
*  If you live better as a woman, you feel better as a woman, you're a woman to me.
*  Congratulations.
*  I don't care.
*  But you're competing against men.
*  You can go fuck, or competing as women rather, you can go fuck yourself.
*  You're not a woman in the sense of you don't have double X chromosome.
*  You didn't grow up as a woman.
*  You're not a biological woman.
*  If you want to be treated as a woman, that's fine.
*  But you can't just decide you're a woman and now you're going to break world records in
*  fucking dead lifts and you're going to run faster than any woman that's ever lived.
*  You're going to beat them in bike races.
*  You're going to break world records as a trans woman.
*  You're crazy.
*  What happens to all these regular women that didn't get the advantage of growing up through
*  puberty with testosterone?
*  They're getting fucked over.
*  That's the reason why we have men and women's divisions in the first place.
*  There's this weird cop out there.
*  Well, it's not fair in some sports because there's LeBron James.
*  I hate to use LeBron again.
*  There's Mike Tyson.
*  There's these outliers who are these freak physical specimens.
*  Yeah, there are.
*  But they're men versus men.
*  There's freak physical specimens in men.
*  But when you go so far, so far over that, when you take a biological male and they're
*  just breaking world records as a woman, you've got to go, come on.
*  We're entering into this complete nonsense area.
*  This is just progressive thinking, this ideology taking to the extreme.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and I mean, I don't know what the answer is because the women, if they do start taking
*  testosterone, then they obviously can't compete against women legally any longer.
*  So they're sort of in limbo.
*  I don't know if there needs to be a third category of athletics.
*  Trans.
*  The trans category.
*  That's the perfect answer.
*  I don't think even if the women take steroids, if it would be fair.
*  I don't even know if that would be fair because they're still not going through puberty.
*  Like you would have to, I mean, first of all, there's not a lot of data on this.
*  There's not a lot of data in terms of years and years of competition where they've studied
*  athletes that have been trans versus athletes that have been biologically female versus
*  athletes that are biologically male.
*  I don't think there's a lot of studying on this.
*  This is people going with the current thinking and the current progressive ideology where
*  they don't want to be criticized.
*  They don't want to be called transphobic.
*  They don't want to have articles written about them or people call them terrible names and
*  talk shit about them.
*  And it's such a small percentage of the population and it's become an issue that is being identified
*  for political reasons.
*  Yes.
*  You know, it's something that is like, like my kid is at college now and like every college
*  now and like every class, you have to say your name, what gender you identify as and
*  what pronoun you want to be referred to as.
*  Do you know how many fucking people this is affecting?
*  Is there five in the school?
*  If that, if that, it's, I believe the current number of people that are trans in this country
*  is somewhere around 1%.
*  Is that what the number is?
*  Do we even know?
*  Let's find out.
*  I'm fine with all of it up until it comes to sports.
*  I mean, if you just, if you want to identify with they, them, you know, you want to be
*  a they person.
*  I might fuck up occasionally because it's odd.
*  Yeah.
*  I might make mistakes.
*  If you want to be called Caitlin.
*  Okay.
*  Hi, Caitlin.
*  Okay.
*  I don't care.
*  Right.
*  But with sports, you can fuck all the way off.
*  0.6%.
*  Okay.
*  That's hilarious.
*  It's not even one.
*  Half of a, basically half of a percent.
*  And Elizabeth Warren, she's getting shit because she was, she was supporting trans prisoners
*  having the right to have corrective surgery in jail.
*  And of course people had a field day with like the amount of money that that would cost.
*  And it's like, she should just say pass.
*  What's your opinion on that, Elizabeth?
*  Let me talk about the economy.
*  Let me talk about healthcare.
*  Yeah, that's not a good one.
*  But that's one that I guarantee if you sat down and talked to her about it, like this
*  is, this is an ideologically based opinion that's she's probably looked at her demographic,
*  which is progressive left wing.
*  You know, she's a woman, she's running for president.
*  And a big part of her being candidate is the fact that we would like to have a woman president,
*  particularly people on the left.
*  They look fucked up with Hillary Clinton didn't go well.
*  Maybe Elizabeth Warren's our gal.
*  Yeah.
*  She seems to talk well.
*  She's strong.
*  Experienced.
*  Yeah, maybe she's the one.
*  Maybe she's the one.
*  Well, well, she's got to support that because you want the whole Democratic Party.
*  Otherwise, someone will fucking snatch up those people in an independent category, a
*  green category.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, fuck it, I'm voting for Jill Stein because she's a piece of shit.
*  Or Elizabeth Warren's a piece of shit and she won't, she doesn't address trans rights.
*  Yeah.
*  There was a lot of third party voters in the last election.
*  Sure.
*  They swung the election.
*  I was one of them.
*  Jill Stein?
*  Gary Johnson.
*  Oh, no shit.
*  Yeah, so I said I'll vote for you.
*  What was his deal?
*  Well, he didn't know anything about, he was sunk because he didn't know where Aleppo was.
*  Oh, I remember that guy.
*  That sunk him.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, people were considering him fairly seriously.
*  Maybe I'm serious about Gary Johnson.
*  He seems fairly reasonable.
*  We could use a reasonable guy.
*  And they asked him, what do you think we do about Aleppo?
*  He's like, what?
*  Fucks Aleppo.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  That's a city where a lot of bad shit's happening right now, bro.
*  But did Trump know where Aleppo was?
*  He doesn't have to.
*  He doesn't have to.
*  They could say, what are you going to do about Aleppo?
*  He'd probably go, where's Aleppo?
*  Syria.
*  Oh, well, that place is a mess.
*  Yeah.
*  We're done with that.
*  I think we're done with that.
*  I think we canceled them.
*  So Aleppo's in Syria, right?
*  Is that where it is?
*  I think that's what it is.
*  Yeah.
*  It was almost like a trick question.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because who the fuck?
*  Yeah, he didn't know, but who does?
*  Yeah.
*  Who did?
*  I got all the people like, this fucking idiot doesn't even know where Aleppo is.
*  I didn't know where Aleppo was.
*  Yeah, I didn't either.
*  I didn't know the question either.
*  Yeah.
*  Obviously, I'm not running for president.
*  Well, we're kind of hoping that that person knows the shit we don't know.
*  Or they tell him when he gets in there.
*  But that's the scary thing about Trump is that other leaders will have advisors around
*  them that they trust, that tell them stuff.
*  But Trump doesn't seem to read the...
*  He's not interested in that.
*  He's not interested in that.
*  No.
*  They booed the fuck out of him at the UFC.
*  Oh, were you there?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, because I heard from one camp that they cheered and from another camp that they...
*  His son said they cheered for him.
*  Listen to daddy.
*  I took my fucking headphones off just to listen.
*  And it was, boo!
*  Really?
*  Yeah, man.
*  18,000 people going, boo!
*  His son said they were chanting USA.
*  Maybe four people behind him were chanting USA.
*  The rest were saying boo, SA.
*  Is that what Donald Jr. said?
*  That's what Donald Jr. was very upset.
*  Listen, if that was your dad, you'd probably say that too.
*  Look, they booed the fuck out of him.
*  I'm sure some people clapped.
*  I'm sure.
*  But if you had to bet your money on it, what was the greater percentage?
*  Was it boos or claps?
*  It was fucking boos.
*  Dude, I took my headphones off.
*  I was right there.
*  I was 50.
*  I could have hit him with a rock.
*  He was right over there.
*  Boo!
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm surprised he showed up after what happened at the World Series.
*  The same fucking thing happened a week before.
*  Maybe he figured because it was DC, it was because it's so liberal in DC.
*  He probably figured because it was at the fights.
*  He's at cage fights.
*  Also, he's friends with Dana White.
*  They're good friends, apparently.
*  There's a picture on Dana's Instagram of him and Donald sitting in front of the television
*  watching fights.
*  They're watching the prelims before he went out.
*  Dana watches some of the card in his green room, listens to the commentary, and wants
*  to see.
*  Because there's a lot of moving pieces involved in being the President of the United States
*  and also the President of the UFC.
*  A lot of moving pieces.
*  You don't have a lot of time to sit through the entire pay-per-view while you're there.
*  Dana sits in the back and he watches a lot of the pay-per-view card on the screen in
*  his office or in his green room.
*  He was back there with Donald sitting on the couch.
*  He put it on his Instagram just watching some fights.
*  It's just him and Trump sitting there.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  Look at that.
*  Wow.
*  I was watching my friend Corey Anderson.
*  Damn.
*  Knock out Johnny Walker.
*  So look at that, watching fights.
*  Like what?
*  You think Dana White's been to Fuck Island?
*  Look at this kid, Khabib.
*  Ask him, where did my father's visa?
*  Send location.
*  Yeah, his father can't get a visa.
*  Yeah, ask Donald, bro.
*  Come on.
*  Good for Khabib.
*  Khabib got 46,000 likes on that.
*  Walking to Mass Square Garden last night with Dana White for the big UFC championship fight
*  was a little bit like walking to a Trump rally.
*  Plenty of MAGA and KAG present.
*  What is KAG?
*  Keep America Great.
*  Oh.
*  Okay.
*  Great energy.
*  Fantastic job, Dana.
*  Headed to D.C. and then to Kentucky for the big Matt Bevin rally.
*  Okay.
*  Well, look, for sure some people cheered.
*  For sure.
*  For sure.
*  For sure some people waved at him.
*  Some wavy people.
*  Look, some people were psyched to see him.
*  If I was in the crowd and I was hammered and he was there, I'd be like, what's up, bro?
*  I'd yell at him.
*  I'd say hi.
*  I'd wave at him.
*  But the reaction, like when he walked in, it's a lot of boos.
*  But that's just fucking going to happen, man.
*  He's a controversial character.
*  You know?
*  Like anywhere he goes, you're going to get a lot.
*  It's fun to boo.
*  Yeah.
*  It's fun to go, fuck you.
*  It's fun.
*  You're going to do something when you see somebody.
*  You're either going to cheer or you're going to boo.
*  Yeah.
*  You're going to be like, I'm going to do service all around him.
*  There was a lot of noise, man.
*  A lot of noise.
*  But a lot of it was, ugh.
*  Yeah.
*  But it wasn't like, fuck Trump.
*  Fuck Trump.
*  There was no chant.
*  You know?
*  This place is where he can't go.
*  Right?
*  Like if he went to an LBGT rally, I would guarantee that's a place where he can't go.
*  Even if he's pro-LBGT with his policy, that's a place where they're going to be pretty
*  universally hate him.
*  Yeah.
*  Where would you say he can't go?
*  Where wouldn't be a good move?
*  I think any kind of a woman's movement, like a Me Too marches.
*  Yeah.
*  What if he had dressed?
*  Like when they had those women marches, we're all wearing the pussy hats and walking the
*  street.
*  And they have a little speaker.
*  They have speakers.
*  And he has a fucking, he puts up, they set up a stage and he comes out to address them.
*  He starts grabbing everybody's hat.
*  Grabbing the pussy hat.
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  What?
*  We'll possess someone to want that job.
*  I mean, look, if you wanted to have the best case scenario answer, it's like, I want to
*  do a good job and make this country great and do better.
*  But what do you think really?
*  It's ego.
*  I was watching Andrew Yang on some morning talk show on Sunday and he's walking down
*  the street with his wife and it's a Sunday.
*  He's got his fucking kids.
*  And I'm like, this is your Sunday?
*  He's got followers with his name on his.
*  Imagine it like strangers with Fitzsimmons on a placard walking behind you, cheering
*  on a Sunday.
*  I want to be home.
*  I want to watch a fucking football game, play with my kid, make a meal.
*  But these people every day, they're working 16 hour days where they're speaking, saying
*  the same shit and they're saying, we're, we're winning.
*  They always say we.
*  No, just say I am.
*  Be as fucking selfish as you really are.
*  I'm winning.
*  More people are liking me than those other people.
*  It's a bad job.
*  It's a bad job that no one should have.
*  It's a, it's a job that should be a giant round table of geniuses should be deciding
*  the fate of the country.
*  Yeah.
*  And they all should be on mushrooms.
*  They all should be on ego dissolving doses of mushrooms so that none of them are acting
*  in their own self interest.
*  They all should have zero financial investments in anything that has anything to do with any
*  decisions that they make.
*  Like they should have to give up all their stocks.
*  They should have to absolutely make sure like, like Trump is able to have all his businesses
*  be run by his kids, which is kind of hilarious.
*  But then he makes decisions that would benefit his businesses that are being run by his kids.
*  And as soon as he's out of office, he gets, he jumps back in and takes over again, which
*  is like, yeah, this, what do you think is going to happen when they get his taxes?
*  Cause they're pretty close.
*  They're pretty close.
*  It's going to go to the Supreme Court now.
*  The last court said that he has to turn them over.
*  And what they're doing is they're going after his accountant instead of him.
*  That way the accountant will be liable as opposed to him personally, cause he's never
*  going to do it.
*  But if you're, if you're fucking, you know, Harvey Altman and company, you got to do it.
*  You're not going to go to jail for him.
*  Right.
*  You saw what happened with Michael Cohen.
*  Right.
*  Like you go to jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  There's no pardons.
*  You're going to jail.
*  Bunch of them went to jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Quite a few people are in jail.
*  Manafort.
*  Jail.
*  Real jail.
*  Yep.
*  Like, like you can't see anybody locked in a cell jail.
*  It's not going to matter when his taxes come out.
*  It's not going to matter.
*  It's nothing.
*  None of it matters.
*  He's got his file.
*  The only thing this election comes down to is whether or not the left can get people
*  to show up because his 46% or whatever percent are into him.
*  They're fucking there on November 4th next year.
*  They're showing up.
*  You know what was crazy?
*  Chris Rock went on stage right after he won.
*  And Chris Rock said, you don't know that motherfucker.
*  He goes, let me tell you something.
*  He ain't leaving.
*  He goes, he's going to be the president for a long fucking time.
*  He ain't going to leave.
*  And I was thinking like, what does that mean?
*  Like you have to leave.
*  Yeah.
*  Like if he loses, you imagine if he loses and he doesn't want, he doesn't believe he
*  lost.
*  Well, he's already said he won't believe it.
*  He's already said that there's going to be a revolution.
*  Can you imagine?
*  Yeah.
*  He's laying the groundwork for, could be ugly, including the impeachment, which would be
*  even worse than him just not getting elected.
*  If he was impeached, can you imagine what would happen?
*  I don't think he's going to get impeached.
*  Not impeached.
*  If he was, he's being impeached if he was convicted.
*  If he's convicted and then removed from office, it would be crazy.
*  But I don't think that's going to happen.
*  I think someone explained to me, was it Kyle Dunigan explained to me?
*  How many people?
*  What's that?
*  No, not Kyle.
*  Kyle Dunigan did explain it.
*  You want to try it.
*  Kyle Kalinsky.
*  Sorry, Kyle.
*  Kyle Kalinsky, who's my favorite online political commentator.
*  Very wise guy.
*  He's a left-wing guy, but like he calls it like he sees it.
*  He's very educated and very aware of all the pitfalls that is plaguing the left and the
*  right.
*  And he said that you would need all these Republicans to vote on it in order for him
*  to actually be impeached.
*  And they're not going to.
*  No, there's like 22 Republican senators that would have to flip.
*  Yeah.
*  And so far they have zero.
*  They're not going to flip.
*  No, of course they're not.
*  They're more interested in their party than they are in anything else.
*  You have to, the Republicans, they have to stick together.
*  where, you know, look, I'm not a Republican, but if I was, I would be extremely concerned
*  about censorship in social media, which is a real thing.
*  Censorship of Republican ideas and conservative ideas is absolutely a real thing.
*  And it's not just real, it's accepted as being the right thing to do by certain organizations.
*  I mean, they've been caught on camera and hidden camera talking about the ways that
*  you can silence conservative voices.
*  You know, this is not like these, when you look at social media platforms, they're essentially
*  the best way to get ideas out there, right?
*  It's even better than broadcast news, because if you put something on Fox or CBS or whatever,
*  how many people are really going to watch it?
*  Is it a thousand, a million?
*  I mean, how many people watch it?
*  If you have a clip that goes viral, that clip on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook, wherever,
*  that could get 30 million people, 40 million people, way fucking more than is ever going
*  to watch it on television.
*  And they've kind of accepted that on late night television.
*  Like late night television has kind of accepted that what they're looking for is these clips,
*  these moments, these clips that almost act as advertisements for the show.
*  You know, where it's James Corden fucking making people sing in his car, that kind of shit.
*  They're trying to get these clips that go viral, because the show itself, I don't know
*  how many people are watching, a few hundred thousand at the most, right?
*  It's nothing in comparison to a lot of the, like, what's that guy's name that's the famous
*  makeup kid?
*  He's a gay fellow?
*  James Charles.
*  That guy's videos on makeup get way more fucking views than anything that happens on Fox News.
*  And that's a fact.
*  That's the only thing that happens on MSNBC.
*  And that's a fact.
*  Okay?
*  Social media is way more potent than anything else when it comes to getting a message out.
*  And for sure, conservatives are being discriminated against on social media by social media platforms.
*  Well, what's weird about it is that when you think about social media and coming out of
*  Silicon Valley, which is famously left wing, the election was really swung by the internet
*  in Trump's favor.
*  You know, whether or not you want to call them bots that were set up by Russia or whether
*  or not it was just, they were a well-organized campaign.
*  They just, they were really smart and very sharp about videos that they put out.
*  Yes.
*  They have a thing now where they put out a lot of memes that they encourage people to
*  make memes about.
*  Yes.
*  They're all over.
*  Democrats are so far behind the Republicans when it comes to using it.
*  But you're right.
*  I mean, if you ban certain people from Twitter and from YouTube, that's censorship.
*  Yes, it is censorship.
*  And even if you're not banning them from those platforms, if you're shadow banning them,
*  if you're making it very difficult for people to find them, which is real, it's a real thing
*  that they do.
*  They, you know, the way you post, like if you have a post on social media, it doesn't
*  just go up in chronological order anymore.
*  Now it's affected by an algorithm.
*  So I might see your posts or I might not see your posts in my feed.
*  It's dependent upon what I like and what I watch and what I see.
*  When I go to search, like if you look at my search feed, you know, you see, you see people
*  beating the fuck out of each other and girls doing squats.
*  That's like my search.
*  It's all like, like it's the most cartoonish version of me possible.
*  Yeah.
*  And you see all like big bull elk screaming and dudes getting head kicked in a muscle
*  car doing a burnout.
*  That's my fucking, that's all you can look at my Instagram search and that's all affected
*  entirely by this algorithm that figures out what I like.
*  Yeah.
*  And then also recommends things to me.
*  Like in terms of like, there's a lot of sponsored things on Instagram.
*  Like, oh, I could use that.
*  Is that good?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't have to Google it.
*  Is that fucking good?
*  And it's because it's targeting me.
*  It's targeting me.
*  It knows that I search for certain things.
*  I look at certain things.
*  These are the sites that I follow.
*  These are the things that I interact with.
*  So let's sell them something.
*  And it does the same with you.
*  It does the same with Jamie.
*  It does the same with everybody.
*  So they can, in certain social media platforms, use that algorithm to discriminate so they
*  can decide, hey, this fucking guy keeps chirping on and on about Hillary Clinton's war crimes
*  and all this.
*  We don't need this guy around.
*  We don't need this guy and all of his fucking right-wing bullshit and all his Make America
*  Great Again bullshit.
*  So we'll shadow ban him.
*  And so they can shove you into this category where it's very difficult to find your page.
*  And it's very difficult for your shit to show up.
*  And a lot of people have seen their views drop drastically.
*  Their interactions drop drastically because people aren't seeing their shit anymore.
*  Andrew Santino had that happen to him.
*  No shit.
*  He talked to someone, talked to someone on the phone that told him he was shadow banned.
*  And he was like, what does that mean?
*  They're like, well, it's because of a post that you made.
*  He goes, well, what post is it?
*  They wouldn't tell him what post it was.
*  What kind of post would it have been?
*  Is he political?
*  No.
*  He's like, I'm not political at all.
*  But he's a comic and he says ridiculous shit.
*  And he's a redhead.
*  And so people are probably like, look at this guy, this super white-looking guy who says
*  a bunch of ridiculous shit.
*  Get rid of him.
*  Off of his head.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I had this guy, weird fella, I think is his handle on Twitter.
*  And he used to say stupid shit.
*  He was goofy, whatever.
*  I would interact with him a little bit.
*  And then he emailed me at my site to say that he got banned from Twitter.
*  Remember on Halloween when a kid showed up at the White House and Trump and
*  Milani were standing there and Trump put candy on top of the kid's head instead of canning
*  it to him.
*  It was like a really ridiculous, like, this guy can't even just put candy in the kid's
*  bag.
*  He's got to put it on his head.
*  So it was like something that became a meme.
*  And this guy just wrote, I wish the kid had kicked him in the shins.
*  Thrown off Twitter for saying that.
*  It was a woman named Megan Murphy.
*  She's what's called a turf.
*  Do you know what a turf is?
*  No.
*  Trans exclusionary radical feminist.
*  And she is one of those radical feminists that don't believe that a trans person is
*  a woman.
*  And she was arguing that these people don't have, they shouldn't have a voice in women's
*  issues.
*  Like you're not a woman.
*  And so this is her opinion.
*  And some people think that that opinion is transphobic.
*  Some people think she should be allowed to have that opinion.
*  While on Twitter, she wrote, a man is never a woman.
*  They told her just take down that tweet.
*  So you know what she did?
*  She made a screenshot of it.
*  She took down that tweet and then she posted a picture of the screenshot.
*  And then they banned it for life.
*  Wow.
*  You know who's not banned for life?
*  OJ Simpson.
*  Double homicide, armed kidnapping.
*  Hey, Twitter world.
*  Hey, Twitter world.
*  It's your friend OJ with football picks.
*  Hey, Twitter world.
*  He's fine.
*  But this lady who's just said with her words, a man is never a woman, which biologically
*  is correct.
*  Banned.
*  Wow.
*  Do you know what else you get banned for?
*  Damn.
*  You know what else you get banned for for life?
*  What?
*  Dead naming.
*  Do you know what dead naming is?
*  What's that?
*  If you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce.
*  Really?
*  Banned for life.
*  No shit.
*  Yes.
*  For life.
*  Damn.
*  Ridiculous.
*  Wow.
*  This is where we're living in.
*  This is this political ideology world.
*  This is the reason why someone like Elizabeth Warren thinks she has to say taxpayer money
*  should pay for prisoners.
*  Some fucking mass murderer who decides he's a woman now, they get this transitionary surgery.
*  Transition surgery.
*  Yeah.
*  Reassignment surgery.
*  Whatever you want to call it.
*  Look, I wish there was a fucking pill that you could take.
*  I wish there was a place where you can go where they zap you like the place where they turned
*  Bruce Banner into the Hulk that turns you into a woman.
*  A legit 100% bona fide XY or XX chromosome woman.
*  I wish there was.
*  I wish there was.
*  So this is no argument.
*  Yeah.
*  The argument is in changing someone, but not really.
*  You know, like you're still your chromosomes and your biological makeup and then forcing
*  people to comply.
*  So it's a thing of compliance.
*  Like you're supposed to not bring up the fact that this person used to be a man.
*  Look, if your name is Greg, but like my friend Aubrey, okay, perfect example, his name used
*  to be Chris, but he tripped balls one day and decided he wanted to change his name.
*  So he changed his name.
*  We all just called him Aubrey now.
*  I don't call him Chris anymore.
*  He was Chris for years.
*  I knew him as Chris for years.
*  And then he became Aubrey.
*  I'm like, all right, man, you want to be Aubrey?
*  Now you're Aubrey.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  But if I called him Chris, would I be dead named?
*  Yeah, right.
*  Right.
*  You know what else is weird is that like the same mentality that says this says that a
*  white kid who grows dreadlocks and dresses in urban streetwear is culturally appropriating.
*  Yes.
*  Many, many of the people that would think that, yeah, including there was a movement
*  that they had a band.
*  I think most people abandoned it, but it was really ridiculous for a while where they were
*  where they were yelling at white girls wearing hoop earrings because they were saying that
*  this is a Latina thing.
*  You're culturally appropriating.
*  I remember that.
*  But it's not like then if you historically you got to go back to ancient Sumerians where
*  they invented hoop earrings.
*  So are you from Babylon?
*  Are you are you from Mesopotamia?
*  No?
*  Then shut the fuck up because you're culturally appropriating.
*  Do you have a Korean phone in your hand?
*  Yeah.
*  Guess what?
*  That's culturally appropriating.
*  Are those Italian jeans?
*  Culturally appropriating.
*  Who made your sneakers?
*  Huh?
*  China?
*  What the fuck are we talking about?
*  Culturally appropriating is one of the dumbest fucking things because that's what cities
*  are.
*  They're melting pots of awesome cultures and they all get together.
*  If you're a fucking dude and you want to dress up like Bruce Lee, that doesn't mean you're
*  culturally appropriating.
*  It means you're a Bruce Lee fan and it's kind of cool.
*  You're admiring that and so you're trying to take it on.
*  It's all woke.
*  It's all woke culture.
*  It's this culture of compliance.
*  They want you to comply.
*  That's what it's about more than anything.
*  It's getting people to change, getting people to listen to you and do what you want them
*  to do.
*  I want you to stop wearing those fucking earrings.
*  I want you to stop wearing dreadlocks.
*  Meanwhile, dreadlocks, Romans wore fucking dreadlocks.
*  Dreadlocks are not necessarily a black thing, although most black people, like there was
*  more rather black people wearing them than white people.
*  But white people have had dreadlocks forever.
*  It's like you can, we've all seen dirty hippies with dreadlocks.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a fucking Grateful Dead concert.
*  It's a lot of dirty white people with dreadlocks.
*  They're not trying to culturally appropriate.
*  They're trying to be dirty hippies with dreadlocks.
*  Yeah.
*  They exist.
*  They're real.
*  To say that that's cultural appropriation is fucking crazy.
*  We all appropriate.
*  We all do.
*  We all do.
*  If you are in the United States in 2019, you're a part of the greatest melting pot the world
*  has ever known.
*  And to decide that you can have some of that but you can't have other parts, like come
*  on, man.
*  Stop.
*  Good luck on Halloween.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  I read this list of things you shouldn't do on Halloween.
*  It was like, don't put a feather in your head.
*  Don't put, don't even tattoo.
*  Don't put a tattoo of something that would identify you as Native American or Asian.
*  Yeah.
*  Don't have Asian letters tattooed.
*  That was a thing that people used to do.
*  Oh, is that a thing you shouldn't do now?
*  Yeah, you can't do that anymore.
*  I never was a fan of that to begin with.
*  Obama wrote, yeah, he didn't write.
*  He gave a speech.
*  Oh, I saw that.
*  It was excellent.
*  It was great.
*  Yeah, it was excellent.
*  He's telling people like we were looking to cancel people all the time.
*  And this is a perfect quote that he said, the world is messy and it is messy.
*  Here's what we got to stop looking for things that make you angry and just try, try to let
*  things go and just be nice to each other.
*  It's not that hard.
*  And dialogue.
*  These people want to just talk and have you listen.
*  I saw a woman coming out of a fucking restaurant the other day and I was walking in and a t-shirt
*  said, I don't want to hear, or men stop talking.
*  I don't want to hear from men.
*  And it was like, I'm sorry, did I do something to you?
*  Have I not raised a beautiful daughter and been a loving husband and a great son to my
*  mother and-
*  And a great friend to a lot of women.
*  I've mentored many female comics that I bring on the road with me and hired when I was a
*  head writer on TV shows that I've hired.
*  And it's like, don't fucking put me in that category.
*  How about we talk about, do you have an issue with what's going on with you personally involving
*  me?
*  Well, let's talk about it.
*  As a human being, one on one, as an individual.
*  But that's the thing.
*  They're denying the individual and they're making everything binary.
*  It's you and them.
*  It's us and them.
*  It's one and zero.
*  It's not, there's no room for nuance.
*  There's no room for the complexity that is the human race.
*  This idea like, men should shut the fuck up.
*  I don't want to hear from white men.
*  That's another one.
*  I've seen that shirt.
*  I don't want to hear from white men.
*  Maybe that's who it was.
*  I don't want to hear from white men.
*  It's all nonsense.
*  It comes from people that want compliance.
*  The whole thing about woke culture is people that felt like they've been pushed around,
*  they felt like they've been bullied, they felt like they've been maligned, they haven't
*  been treated fairly, and now they want to turn it on you.
*  And they don't give a fuck.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  If you're a white man, I don't give a fuck what your opinion is.
*  Shut your fucking mouth.
*  And they feel like they can say that because this culture emboldens people by letting people
*  get away with nonsense, by letting people say things like that.
*  Like walk into it.
*  Like if I owned a restaurant and someone walked in with a shirt like that, I'd be like, get
*  the fuck out of here.
*  Just like if you walked into a shirt with a shirt that said black people should shut
*  the fuck up.
*  Get out.
*  Get out.
*  Get out.
*  You think that?
*  You have no room for black people talking?
*  Get, I don't want you around.
*  Your mind is rotten.
*  You're thinking a terrible way.
*  Go cleanse yourself.
*  Go take a fucking meditation class or something.
*  Figure out what's wrong with you.
*  But don't bring that toxic energy around people.
*  It's stupid.
*  It's discriminatory.
*  Well, it's half the population.
*  And it's like, I understand that women have been, they've had a different experience than
*  men.
*  Black people have had a different experience than white people.
*  There's issues that need to be addressed and corrected.
*  And enlist me in that.
*  I'm perfectly willing to-
*  But don't force you to comply.
*  You know, there's a giant issue in this country that is like skirted.
*  It gets addressed, but then it gets ignored.
*  And that is, what do they do with all the communities that have been forever affected
*  by slavery?
*  Like, what about all those, all those, when people talk about reparations, it gets dismissed.
*  Like it's not you.
*  I didn't do anything.
*  It's not you.
*  It doesn't have to do with you.
*  You didn't do anything.
*  You never owned a slave.
*  I never owned a slave.
*  We didn't have anything to do with it.
*  denying that there's parts of this country that are forever affected by slavery and then
*  afterwards by racist laws.
*  Those red line laws-
*  Oh yeah, reconstruction and Jim Crow.
*  All that.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Never really been addressed.
*  Never been addressed in terms of a correction.
*  Now, in terms of like reparations, you give people money.
*  I don't know if that works.
*  If I thought that by me paying more in taxes and them giving reparations, we could ease
*  the tension, racial tension in this country, I would be like, okay, that's all you have
*  to do, but it's not all you have to do, right?
*  Because you're still going to have these communities that are forever affected until something
*  has been done to correct them.
*  Like I'm not in favor of giving people who were never slaves money as reparations, but
*  I am in favor of giving communities money and figuring out a way to rebuild them, figuring
*  out a way to make them safer, better-
*  Preschools, school lunches-
*  Yeah, everything.
*  Community programs, getting people off the streets that are involved in gangs and drugs
*  and all that stuff.
*  I've said this a thousand times, but it bears repeating.
*  The best way to have a great country is if we're a team or if we're a country, we're
*  supposed to be a team, right?
*  We're a community, a giant community of 320 million people.
*  What's the best way to make it stronger?
*  Well, you have less losers.
*  That's the best way.
*  Well, what's the likelihood of you becoming a loser if you're in an impoverished, drug-riddled,
*  crime-ravaged area?
*  Well, it's highly likely that you're not going to succeed in that area unless you are some
*  person of unbelievable character and unbelievable will and fortitude, and you're raised by people
*  who did a phenomenal job essentially in a war zone, right?
*  If you live in the South Side of Chicago and you look at the murder rate in the South Side
*  of Chicago and you compare it to the murder rate in war zones, they're pretty fucking
*  similar, right?
*  So, essentially, these people are being asked to do their best and come out of this war
*  zone and pull themselves up by their bootstraps, whereas other people around them are not in
*  a war zone.
*  If we're a community, we're supposed to look at that and go, hey, how the fuck do you stop
*  this thing from being a war zone?
*  How do we stop this?
*  How do we do that with Detroit?
*  How do we do that with Baltimore?
*  How do we do that with all these impoverished areas?
*  That should be addressed.
*  Well, it has to be looked at as our problem, not their problem.
*  We are all living with ramifications of inequality.
*  It's affecting us on a daily basis, whether it's crime or whether it's our gross national
*  product would be much higher if more people were educated and more people were proud of
*  their work.
*  And so, there has to be pride.
*  Less losers, more pride, more identifying with progress.
*  And I think if you live in a certain culture in this country, there isn't a pride in succeeding
*  because you haven't seen it.
*  Right.
*  More opportunity.
*  And this includes poor white cultures.
*  Like, I have a friend who's from Kentucky, and he tells me about these fucking people
*  that live in these coal mining communities where the coal mining community, the coal's gone,
*  and the community shut down, people are hooked on pills.
*  And he's like, you have never seen poverty like this.
*  He's like, you've never seen it.
*  Where like everyone in the community is on pills.
*  Everyone is surviving on like below minimum wage.
*  Everyone's a criminal.
*  Like it's just, everyone's poor.
*  It's just horrific.
*  Did you ever see the wild and wonderful whites of West Virginia?
*  No.
*  Holy shit.
*  Oh, I think it's a Johnny Knoxville documentary.
*  Did he put it together?
*  It's amazing.
*  It's amazing for all the wrong reasons.
*  Because these are the trashiest white trash people that have ever lived.
*  And they're all on pills.
*  They're all turning tricks and doing crazy shit and robbing people and shooting people.
*  And it's like everyone has a fucking story that's like, you're like Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone.
*  Like what?
*  Yeah.
*  Putting your hands in your ears like what the fuck?
*  But those communities exist.
*  They exist.
*  And it's so hard to get out.
*  It's so hard to break free.
*  Like we as a community, as a giant 320 million person community,
*  should be concentrating on fixing those spots.
*  At least as much as we're concentrating on fixing problems in other parts of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  I understand the logic behind going to these other parts of the world that are fucked up
*  and trying to solve these problems before they affect us.
*  Before they come back to us.
*  That's the logic.
*  I get it.
*  But internally, inside of our country, we're not doing the same thing.
*  We're allowing people to become violent criminals by never giving them a chance.
*  But never giving them an outcome or never giving them possibilities other than what
*  they see around them.
*  Not giving them any opportunities.
*  And we treat it as if they're supposed to be, we're all supposed to be even.
*  We're all supposed to be on this even game.
*  No, some people got one shitty card and some people got like five aces.
*  It doesn't.
*  Yeah, there's this documentary they made about a public school in Chicago.
*  I forget what Oak Park I think it was in.
*  It was called America is Me.
*  And it was like this 10-part series and it showed the experiences of the white kids versus
*  the black kids because it was an integrated school.
*  But you were seeing that the black kids were lagging grade-wise, graduation rates.
*  And they just went in depth and you saw that a lot of the black kids were dealing with
*  single parents.
*  They were dealing with being fucking evicted.
*  Some of them being homeless or just not having the resources like, you know, the white kids
*  are getting SAT prep classes.
*  And, you know, they're getting extra help because they've got a parent that's not
*  working that can pick them up from school and drive them to a tutor.
*  And there's just all these things that you're seeing.
*  One side is getting fostered and the other side is struggling.
*  And it's the same fucking school.
*  So it's not as simple as just put good schools in the community, but there's got to be
*  mentorship programs and there's got to be…
*  Community outreach programs.
*  Community outreach.
*  There's got to be… they got to get preschools.
*  They got to get kids in there at a young age so the parents can work and there's good nutrition.
*  They say that the studies that show preschool, the differences long term of how people come out of
*  there with those extra two years is astronomical.
*  Makes sense.
*  Makes sense.
*  You prep them for it early.
*  But the thing is, this is where a concept like democratic socialism actually makes sense.
*  It's like people think of democratic socialism or anything where you say the word socialism,
*  they go, oh, you're going to take money and give it to lazy people.
*  That's the worst case scenario, right?
*  But man, if we're a community, if we are a community of human beings,
*  we've got to help the people that aren't doing good.
*  There's got to be a reason why they're not doing good.
*  It's not that they're inferior.
*  They have inferior choices.
*  They have inferior opportunities.
*  They have an inferior situation.
*  And it's so hard to get the mass of people behind giving their money to some sort of
*  a program that does take steps to fix this.
*  You just don't hear it.
*  Well, they had the jobs for FDR and the New Deal.
*  They were able to start.
*  People want to work.
*  People don't want to get a welfare check.
*  They want to feel good about themselves.
*  And you want to be busy all day.
*  Sometimes I don't work for a month.
*  I'm between writing jobs.
*  Maybe I take some time off from stand-up.
*  I don't feel good about myself.
*  Terrible.
*  I mean, imagine that times year after year and generation after generation.
*  And for you, it's a choice.
*  If you want to go on the road any time.
*  But that's not a choice for a lot of people.
*  For a lot of choice, they're just fucked.
*  And you used to have...
*  The funny thing is the factory jobs, you look back on them and you go,
*  those are really shitty jobs.
*  I grew up in a factory town and it was like people were not enjoying it.
*  People were getting fucking drunk and high and just getting through.
*  And now we're looking, we're harkening back to like that it was like some golden age of
*  great work.
*  They were union jobs, which was great.
*  But let's shoot higher.
*  The factory jobs aren't coming back.
*  Right.
*  But the real question is like some people, some people don't have aspirations.
*  So if you took someone who's already gone through the school system and like,
*  oh, we're going to get jobs for people.
*  That's not good enough.
*  You got to fix the people that are fucked up.
*  You can't say like an 18 year old person is not a finished product.
*  Right.
*  A 25 year old person who came from a fucked up neighborhood and got all sorts of mental
*  problems and probably PTSD.
*  That's not a finished product.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't say, we got a job for you.
*  Well, because they're fucked in the head.
*  You know, they've had to deal with their friend getting shot.
*  They have to deal with their mom being on crack.
*  Like getting them a job is not enough.
*  I don't know what the answer is.
*  Like obviously we're just two white guys talking shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  We don't have to worry about this.
*  This is not our concern.
*  But if you wanted to, if you wanted to fix, if you were a person, like say if Greg Fitzsimmons
*  became president, how do you fix that?
*  How do you, how do you even make steps to fix that?
*  Because I haven't heard anyone come up with a plan.
*  Maybe there is one that I haven't heard, but a plan where it makes sense, where there's a
*  long term proposition to try to take these communities that are just habitually
*  engulfed in crime and violence, just consistently, like throughout the 60s and the 70s,
*  and fix it and turn it around.
*  Like at least try.
*  Well, there's a gap.
*  The gap between the rich and the poor is growing.
*  Ever since the 80s, it's gotten just out of hand.
*  You know, the amount, the top 1% have 50% of the money or something like that.
*  And it's just, and everything is set up structurally for that to continue to divide more and more.
*  Right.
*  But are they playing a game?
*  Right.
*  They're playing a game called capitalism.
*  And that game, they're dominating that game.
*  And once they get the money, then they keep the money and they pass that money down to
*  their kids and then they keep the money.
*  How do you change that?
*  We could all play that game, right?
*  Like we could all invest in the stock market.
*  We can all just really focus entirely on making money.
*  Or should we not be able to?
*  Like, how do you stop the 1% like these bankers and investment people?
*  How do you stop that?
*  And how do you stop that in a way where it doesn't seem like you're, you know,
*  you're changing the rules of the game because some people are just psycho good at it and
*  completely dedicated to only making money?
*  Well, you're not changing the rules because the estate tax was there from day one.
*  The founding fathers wanted there to be a very large estate tax.
*  They wanted to avoid what happened in Europe, which is these building up of these families
*  that are handing down wealth.
*  And so these kids, you know, so I think we need to go back to right now it's like 35%
*  or something like that on wealth over $10 million if you're a couple.
*  They need to go back to really taking that money back because—
*  And doing what with it though?
*  Put it into schools to start with.
*  I would love that if there was like a real logic to how that money got spent.
*  Right, right.
*  That would be the problem because if it just went to a bunch of like,
*  just if it just went to a bunch of government programs that don't seem to make sense and
*  that are like poorly structured and that money gets wasted, that would make me sick.
*  No, I think it has to be job training programs.
*  It has to be helping small businesses grow with, you know, low-cost loans.
*  But, you know, think about these kids that are inheriting a billion dollars.
*  What are you ever going to contribute to society?
*  As opposed to if you were set up with you went to a private high school,
*  you went to a great university, you went to a graduate school, all of it was paid for,
*  you had nannies, you were given tutors, you should be able to go out and make a good living now.
*  You don't need that billion dollars.
*  Right.
*  And you will feel so much better if you make your own money.
*  Yeah. So there should be enough money left.
*  You know, I'm not saying take away everybody's money when they die,
*  but I'm saying that there's a grotesque amount of money that needs to be pulled back.
*  That's one way of at least putting a chip, like chip away at it.
*  That's one way, right?
*  That money?
*  Yeah.
*  What's another way?
*  What's, I mean, unless you want like cops or police to occupy these areas, like how would you ever stop,
*  like at this point in time, how would you stop places from being crime written?
*  It would have to be like a multi-step program where you would slowly but surely implement it
*  and try to slowly but surely chip away at all these problems.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not something you're going to fix overnight because it didn't happen overnight, you know?
*  Right. Right.
*  No, but I think that's a good point.
*  No.
*  Right. Right. No, there has to be great leadership and there has to be.
*  But man, you've got eight years. You're president, you've got four, and if you're lucky, you get eight.
*  No, I mean local leadership. You need to, you know, city councilmen and, you know,
*  mayors that are really looking at the community and figuring, and each one's different.
*  But I feel like if it's that way, unless it's federally, if it's that way, like,
*  you're dealing with communities that don't have as much money already.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, because just by virtue of the fact that they're crime-ridden and that this is
*  in poverty stricken, these are communities that already don't have any money.
*  Yeah. Low tax base.
*  Let's go back to talking about farts.
*  Yes.
*  This bums me out.
*  When I fart-
*  I get bummed, I get really bummed out when I talk about people that live in poor neighborhoods that
*  don't have a way out because that is one thing that really freaks me out. Like being stuck.
*  Like the feeling of being stuck. I don't know, I mean, I don't know what it is about that
*  feeling, but it's just, you see people in, like I was in Colorado Springs once and I saw this
*  homeless couple and they were begging for money and they had a fucking baby. They had a baby.
*  And it was outside and it was kind of cold. It was like October. And I'll never forget that.
*  I'm seeing this homeless couple with a baby and I'm like, fuck, they have a baby and they're
*  homeless. God damn it. Like that kind of shit freaks me the fuck out. Like people who are just
*  doomed. You're stuck. Like you're stuck, your parents are homeless and you're a baby.
*  And usually one of the parents or both of them is mentally ill. I mean, most homelessness is
*  caused by mental illness. You have addiction, which is usually somebody self-medicating to
*  begin with. If you got to that point, you're usually self-medicating something and it could be
*  a number of things. But there used to be, you had people that were institutionalized because
*  they needed help. You had mental hospitals. You had places where the lowest in our society,
*  the most vulnerable were taken care of and those were closed and those people are on the street now.
*  That was during the Reagan administration, right? Now in LA, we now have typhus.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  They have literally medieval diseases.
*  Tuberculosis is back.
*  There's so many homeless people in LA. They think it might be as many as 70,000 people.
*  Every night, 70,000 people. That's what I heard.
*  70,000. And there's not a fucking single plan that makes any sense to deal with that.
*  Like, how do they fix that?
*  Well, part of the problem is that it's just gotten so expensive to live here. The real estate has
*  gone through the roof and so people that were living on the edge, paycheck to paycheck, all
*  of a sudden you're out. You stay on as many couches as you can until people say, look,
*  you can't live here anymore. And then you're in your car and trying to get, now you got to get
*  to get back into housing. You need to come up with the first, last security deposit.
*  Where the fuck are you getting that?
*  Where are you getting that? That's definitely happening in some cases. And a lot of cases
*  is just drug addicts too, right? People who are addicted to drugs.
*  Yeah. Well, one of the things they're finding is that like, I work with this group called
*  People Concern in LA and they're trying to get people into housing, transitory housing,
*  where they can at least get a shower, get some decent clothes. We can go on a job interview
*  and get started where you don't have to pay that first, last security deposit.
*  That's great if you're not mentally ill. Right.
*  You know, if you're mentally ill, all the showers in the world aren't going to fix Robert William
*  Aprovaya. Remember that dude? No.
*  You know that guy? He's a guy who comes to the comic store all the time. Very nice guy.
*  He's a perpetual open mic'er. Actually kind of funny. He got some good one-liners,
*  but he's got something wrong. Yeah. And those people need to take
*  medication every day. And when you're on the street, you're not getting it. And what they
*  require is that you go to a certain facility every day to get your pills. They won't give
*  you the pills. These people are fucking, they don't know where they're sleeping that night.
*  They can't show up at a certain time at a certain place. Yeah.
*  So they need to have play. And one of the things they found also is when they give people housing,
*  it used to be contingent on you staying sober. And now they're finding that no,
*  get them off the street. If they're still using, you try to work with them. You try to get them
*  into counseling, but you don't throw them back out on the street because they're using.
*  God, fixing people, dude, fixing people. So fucking hard. Look, I did a podcast this weekend with
*  Artie. Artie Lang. Yeah. He's been sober now for nine months. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fucking
*  great. His eyes, they sparkle. He's alive. That's great. He's right there with you. His stories
*  were hilarious. The best storyteller out there. Oh my God. Dude, it was so fun. Yeah. And I was
*  just thinking, like, you know, I was so happy to see him, so happy to see him sober, crying,
*  laughing and thinking, God damn it. I hope he hangs in there. Yeah. I hope, you know, I hope,
*  you know, they were talking about fixing his nose, but you know, the doctor was like, look,
*  he's going to be on pain pills. If you fix his nose, they're going to give him medication. Like
*  it's too soon. Yeah. Yeah. He needs at least a year of sobriety before he even thinks about
*  doing that. But even then you're taking a guy who's a bona fide addict, a self professed addict,
*  and then you're going to give him drugs. Yeah. Come on. I know you can't do it. You can't do it.
*  No, and that's got to be some painful surgery. I would imagine you'd have to have something
*  come out of that. Nah, you can take it. You can take it. Yeah. Yeah. You're all right. I mean,
*  it sucks. I heard meditation can be as effective as any painkiller if you do it right. Maybe.
*  I doubt it. I don't think so. I bet painkillers are way better. Yeah. People aren't addicted to
*  medication or meditation. They're addicted to medication, not meditation. No, I'm happy for,
*  I'm really happy for Artie. And I've seen him, you know, I saw him before he went in and he was a
*  fucking mess. He was really bad. And he had been doing good. Like he was on crashing the two years
*  that I was there and he would come in and the guy was always on time, knew his lines, improv'd his
*  face off, was always fucking great. And then you'd hear that he'd gone off again. And he was just
*  like, man, can't you just fucking, you're so much to offer. So smart, so talented. But he's also a
*  wild man. That's one of the reasons why he's so funny because he's so impulsive and wild. You know,
*  I mean, that's just who Artie is. Yeah. But goddamn, he's alive right now. He's alive and
*  kicking and his fucking eyes are sparkling. Yeah. Like you talk to him, he's like, ha ha, he's right
*  there. Yeah. He was so funny. Yeah. God damn, he was funny. It was just so nice to see him and hug
*  him. And when someone has gone through hell and back like that, like just to know that he's still
*  there is so nice. You know, we've lost a lot of people. We know a lot of people are gone,
*  that were really great people and really funny people and just not around anymore.
*  They fucked up. Geraldo and I mean, Mitch Hedberg, you can just keep going down that list.
*  Right, right. Yeah. And it's like, it is, it's that wild, they have to find something to replay.
*  I mean, Lenny, I heard Lenny on your show. He was fucking great. I mean, that guy, not that he was
*  ever like a hard addict, but he's been sober for a lot of years and he found ways to replace it and
*  still be a fucking mad man. Yeah. You know, he plays golf like a fucking mad man. He's funny as
*  ever. Yeah. Funny as ever. Funnier, I would say. Oh my God, he's so funny on the podcast. Yeah.
*  He's just rapid fire. He's in his sixties. Yeah. You know, he's a wild man. Yeah. Yeah. I told him
*  to start running. I said a lot of addicts, they start, they, they, he goes, he goes, I never got
*  that run as high. I ran a little bit. I never got that fucking run as high. I'm like, then you got
*  to run a lot. You got to get in shape and then you do it a lot and get used to it. Yeah. The high
*  doesn't kick in right away. There's some layers you got to shed first, but it goes back to what
*  you were talking about earlier, but so many of us are looking for a way to twist our consciousness,
*  to do something to, to just take you out of whatever the fuck the normal sober consciousness
*  is. Yeah. What's wrong with the regular sober consciousness? And I mean, I'm saying this,
*  I'm saying this as somebody who struggles with it. Yeah. I feel all the time like reaching for
*  something. Yeah. You know, even if it's like, I took CBD pills this morning, just because
*  it changes me a little bit. It fucking gives me a little lift. You know, I'm on the road. I'll
*  smoke a little pot. Why? I don't know. I just need to be different right now. I need my head
*  to change right now. Yeah. Well, I think it's the monotony of existential angst too. It's just like
*  wearing you down. You know, you look in the mirror, you see a few more lines, a few more bags.
*  Your skin is just slowly giving away from your skull. Slowly, slowly. Yeah. And we're,
*  we're not going to win this race. No one wins. No one wins this thing. And that just wears you out.
*  Sometimes you just don't want to think about that. You have a couple of drinks, you don't think about
*  it anymore. Like, fuck Donald Trump, Donald. You get hammered. You know, you see the fights,
*  you go to see a game, you go to a concert, you drop acid, you do something. You hit on somebody.
*  You wouldn't have done that. I wouldn't have walked up to that fucking hot chick and told her
*  a joke. No way. But like, couple of drinks. Yeah. Ladies, let me buy you a drink. Come on.
*  I can remember trying to hook up sober after being drunk for so much of my life and then getting
*  sober and then trying to hit on girls and like go to bed with a girl while sober was weird.
*  I was looking at my body like, look at this shitty body. I didn't care about my body when
*  I was drunk. I'd walk to the bathroom naked. Walk back with my dick flopping around.
*  But once you're sober, you're like, this is really odd. I just met this person.
*  I know. And that even sex, like what is that? Like you're trying to get some sort of a rush
*  out of that. You're trying to escape. You know, you're trying to bolt of you together.
*  We're doing something. We're leaving this plane. You know, you're doing something. You're trying to
*  escape whatever this fucking monotonous existence is together. You're seeing her face, a woman that
*  an hour before was sitting in a bar, maybe smiling and thinking to herself, oh, is my five,
*  does my smile feel fake or should I be smiling more? And now all of a sudden she's screaming
*  as she, her eyes are rolled back. Yeah. She's in another dimension. Yeah. Both of you are. Yeah.
*  And then afterwards you got to deal with each other. That is the weirdest thing ever. It's like
*  when you really think you're into someone and then you come and you're like, oh my God, I got to get
*  out of here. How much of it is chemical? It's such a fucking trick. Yeah. And women are like,
*  ah, you just did that. You just pretended you liked me so you could have sex with me.
*  No, I thought I did like you. Yeah. I was, I was tricking myself too. Like I really believed it.
*  If you, you know, if you say a lot of shit that you don't really mean just to fuck some, that's a
*  dirty move. But so many guys, and I've talked to so many guys who echo this, you really think you like
*  them until you come. Right. And then you're like, oh. Yeah. And then whatever was kind of cute before
*  now is annoying and grating on you. It's probably the same with women. They probably like thought
*  you liked, they liked you till you fucked them and then you're hanging around talking and farting and
*  they're like, get this guy out of my fucking apartment. Right. Right. It's biology. Yeah.
*  That's the ultimate trick. Right. You, you are, when you're having sex with someone,
*  especially if you're really aroused and you, they're really hot and you're really into it and they're
*  into you, that is a drug. Yeah. It's, it's definitely a drug. Yeah. It's your, your oxytocin is through
*  the roof. All your fucking pheromones are flying around. You're smelling each other and you're
*  aroused. All your sex hormones are fucking, you're blaring, you know? And it's all,
*  it's the number one thing. Oh yeah. That's it. I mean, we think about it. There's the orgasm and
*  then what's second, what's second in the list of great things that you can experience physically?
*  A runner's high. Yeah. You know, without drugs, just that you can naturally experience.
*  It's pretty up, it's pretty up there. Yeah. Yeah. There's not a lot of things. Well,
*  it's also the, the, that it's difficult to procure, right? It's difficult to get someone who's really
*  attractive to like you. Yeah. Right. I mean, that's the reason why you and I are funny.
*  Yeah. Right. Let's be honest. Like why are, why are most men, why do they have a sense of humor?
*  They have a sense of humor because girls like that. It's a big, it's a big one. Like you can
*  kind of jump through a lot of hoops. You can skip a lot of steps if you're funny. Yeah. If
*  you're a guy and you're funny, cause you have to be smart to be funny. So girls are like, oh,
*  he knows how to be funny. Yeah. You know, and if they're not funny, but they, then you're funny,
*  you can make them laugh. They're like, oh, just bring this fucking comedian with me everywhere.
*  Right. And I always have my own little show. Yeah. And when she likes you because of that,
*  you're like, oh, she likes me cause I'm funny and I'll get funnier. Yeah. I'll work at this.
*  Yeah. I'll be good at this. Dude, when I was in sixth grade, me and John Yerczak used to do comedy
*  routines for the girls at lunch. We had whole fucking routines, like, you know, like Mark's
*  brother's stuff and Muppet Show shit, like whatever worked. We were up there tap dancing for those
*  girls. And they liked it. Vicki Betman and Linda Rae. You're so funny, Greg. They loved it. You're
*  so funny. And I remember that feeling back then, cause I was the skinny little kid with red hair
*  and freckles. No chicks took it. They just cared about the guys that were good at sports. And all
*  sudden, like I'm getting laughs. And, and I just remember feeling like this is what I want to do.
*  This is, this is what I need to do. Yeah. I found it. Yeah. Yeah. So there's that, right? It's like,
*  when guys see a car, like a brand new Mercedes in a commercial and there's a girl with long legs
*  and high heels and she's leaning against the car. You're like, oh my God, is that girl coming to
*  car? If I get the car, will I get her? Yeah. I need to get her. It's hard to get one of those.
*  You get a girl with long legs and high heels and beautiful lips, and she's looking at you like she
*  loves you. That's so difficult to find. It's so difficult to get. Most of the time, those girls,
*  they look, they walk right by you. Like you don't even exist. But look at that. If I get that watch,
*  that watch, there's a girl staring at that watch. She loves that watch. Gotta get that watch.
*  And that's like what's used to sell most things. Like how many things in America in particular are
*  sold by attractive women? Attractive women in ads, attractive women that we associate,
*  if you get this Lamborghini, attractive women will be more drawn to you because it's difficult
*  to get a Lamborghini. This guy can get a Lamborghini. That means he's got $300,000 to
*  throw on a stupid car that's probably going to break down. Yeah. John Ham doing those car ads.
*  Women fucking, they want to get in that car with John Ham. Matthew McConnay. Look at him. Look at
*  that house he lives in. I could be in that house. I just need to, if I meet him, he'll love me.
*  I would put a couch over there though. There's not enough, there's not enough shrubbery inside
*  the house. Gotta fix it. Kind of a modern painting. It just needs a woman's touch.
*  Then he has sex with him. He's like, I gotta go. But I thought. But it's your house. We are forever.
*  Yeah. The ultimate biological trick. If they ever, that's what's going to be really weird.
*  Like if you look at aliens, right? What's the iconic alien? They have the big heads.
*  They have these little boy like bodies. Long fingers. No dicks. Yeah. There's nothing there.
*  Right. Because that's probably what happens in the future. In the future, we all figure out, listen,
*  we are being tricked left and right by our dicks and our vaginas and our sex hormones are talking
*  us into nonsense where we could just be enlightened and we could travel the galaxy together. But we
*  gotta get past all this sex stuff, this biological sex stuff. And you could have an orgasm in your own
*  brain. Here, with this new phone, iPhone 72. Just press the button and get that out of your system.
*  Good. Now we don't need sex anymore. And we don't need our mouths either. We need to talk
*  with our brains. Big giant head with a tiny slit for a mouth. It's like remember that Woody Allen
*  movie Sleepers and they have the orgasmatron? Oh yeah. And you just pass it around and then
*  you have an orgasm and then you move on. That was it. You think about how much work
*  is involved in trying to get an orgasm. How much energy people spend. And then the seduction,
*  right? You meet someone at a bar. Can I buy you a drink? Okay. Want me to light that cigarette?
*  Can't do that anymore. But that was a thing, right? Like light the girl's cigarette, buy a drink. Oh,
*  he's so charming. Oh, thinking maybe. Dance? A mating dance? Let's dance. Watch me shake my hips.
*  I'm going to look you in the eye. Does he know how to dance? A guy who doesn't know how to dance
*  probably sucks in bed. Yeah. That guy can fucking dance. Look at him dance. Maybe I'll let him shoot
*  one in me. Make a baby. It's time to breed. I'm going to breed with a conqueror. A man who could
*  dance who knows how to light a cigarette. He could kill somebody for me. He's big. He's big. He knows
*  how to think. He knows that we got to get out of here. Trouble's brewing. He's a protector.
*  Oh, I'm going to get in his nice car. He can drive fast.
*  He lives in the top of the hill. He's got a good spot where we can see the enemies coming from a
*  long way. That's right. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. So weird. People. I mean, that's our business is like
*  getting people to like us, right? That's a big part of what our business is. Our business is like
*  saying funny shit so people like us. Yeah. And other people do different things. Like some girls,
*  they just work on their squats. You know, just go to the gym a lot. So people like them more.
*  Their ass sticks out more, get more attention. Right. You know, some people are just funny.
*  Some people, they acquire things. Some people acquire power, respect, influence.
*  Yeah. I watch this nature special on the, what are those animals that hang upside down in Australia?
*  Bats? No, they're like furry. They're furry and cute. Wallabies? No, they bounce around.
*  I forget what they're called. Wombats? No, they've got them here too, I think. But anyway,
*  this motherfucker is on one side of the river and he can hear a mating call from the other side of
*  the river and he's slow as shit. Sloth? Sloth. A sloth. So the sloth hears the female sloth and
*  he fucking, and I don't know where they get these cameras from, but they watch this guy go down the
*  tree, across a limb, into the water, can't swim for shit. There's fucking rapids. He makes his way
*  across. All like, aw, cause he can hear that. Gets across, climbs on it. It takes like two days.
*  And then he finds this other sloth and he climbs on top of her, couple shakes of the head, done.
*  Oh, who's this bitch? But now he can think. Now the poor little guy can think. Oh Jesus,
*  she wants to eat my fruit. Fuck out of here. It's my fruit, bitch.
*  She wants to talk about that star that was shining last night. Cause that was entertainment back
*  then. But it's an even weirder dance for a girl because a girl has to figure out whether or not
*  this guy is going to be around, right? She's going to let this guy shoot one inside of her.
*  And then what if she gets pregnant and now this asshole, she has to rely on him and what, is he
*  going to be around? Is he going to sloth? Like she can't, she like, there's a going to be a lot of
*  time or she has to dedicate to taking care of this kid. Maybe she can hold that down a full-time job.
*  Maybe she can't, but there's a lot of fucking resources that need to be dedicated towards
*  raising these children. Is someone going to help? Am I going to be doing this on my own?
*  Women have to be really fucking careful. Really careful. Imagine if guys got pregnant every time
*  we fucked. Oh my God. I had a joke about that. Abortion would be an app on your phone because it
*  would. If we got pregnant, fuck out of here. Oh yeah. Morning after pills would just be
*  on the bedside table every morning. They'd be everywhere. They'd give them to you at hotels.
*  They'd leave mints on the bed. Yeah. Chocolate. Yeah. Fucking Plan B pills. There would be no
*  kids. There's zero kids. There'd be two of us. Women love children. They're nurturing. They're
*  capable. Yeah. We're like, what? Some women, but some women don't want to get boxed into that either.
*  Yeah. And some guys don't want to. Some guys, look, I love being a father. I know you love
*  being a father, but we all, I have friends that are like a bunch of them that have vasectomies.
*  They don't want to have kids. Fuck that. Yeah. Okay. That's okay. It's all okay. There's plenty
*  of people. It's great that you know you don't. Yeah. I mean, I don't even know if you know you
*  don't because maybe you think you don't because you haven't had it. I mean, a kid will change the
*  way your fucking brain works. Yeah. And a lot of times for the better. It made me a way nicer
*  person. Yeah. Way nicer. It made me way more considerate of people's positions too, because
*  I used to think of people always as being static. Like, oh, this is Greg. He's 52. He's always been
*  52. This is what he is. I know. I'm going to talk to him right now. Now I look at people and I go,
*  oh, Greg used to be a baby. He was a baby. Like what did, how did, what, what, what weird
*  circumstances befell him? What fucking weird pitfalls and traps and weird things entered into
*  his life? What weird people fucked him over? What weird people lied to him, stole from him?
*  How did he get to be this bitter person? Right. I hate to use your name there. I didn't mean you.
*  Yeah, why did I become the bitter guy? You're not. I realize halfway and I've created a
*  scenario that's wholly unlike you. But you know, I think of people now in a different way. I used to
*  think of people, angry people, I used to think of them as, oh, fuck that idiot. But now I go, oh,
*  that fucking guy. He got, he got fucked over. Yeah. He got fucked over. That's most of them.
*  Most of them got fucked over and it could have been me. It could have been me easily.
*  Or just have a bad chemical makeup. You know, some people are just fucking ADHD and you think
*  that they're not caring friends because they don't remember to call you or whatever. It's like,
*  that guy's trying to get his shoelace tied. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or maybe he's OCD and he can't wait
*  to wash his hands again. Or maybe he's got Alzheimer's and he can't remember whether he
*  washed his hands. You know what I mean? This. Most people are trying their best. Yeah. And
*  I think a big part of what's wrong in this world is that we're dealing with a lot of communication
*  that's not face to face. A lot of it. A lot of it. Whether it's, you know, he said, she said shit
*  where like, you know, you have a problem with this guy and then another guy tells you, he said some
*  shit about you. What did he say? Fuck that guy. He said that. I'll tell you what really happened.
*  Instead of like you being alone with that guy. Well, what happened? What do you think happened?
*  Well, what I think happened is this and that. And you're like, well, that's definitely not what
*  happened because of this. And then he's got to go, oh, I didn't know that. Well, I didn't want to,
*  I didn't want to, I didn't want to fuck you over. I'm not trying to fuck you over. Well,
*  I thought you were. Okay. Well, now I understand why you were behaving the way you were behaving.
*  Well, we're men here. Let's talk. You know, like I don't, like I don't want any enemies. I want
*  friends. Or let's yell a little bit. Let's figure this out. Yeah. Let's figure this out. But so much
*  of today that is excluded from the formula. So much of today is people dealing with emails.
*  Like how much can be like, I had to put out a fire between two friends in an email recently.
*  One, one person was upset, upset because they thought some person was doing something
*  shitty to them. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, that's not, that's not what happened. Like,
*  okay, let me explain. I'll do my best. But the whole reason everyone, anyone's having this
*  conversation is because you guys weren't talking in front of each other, you know? And then there's
*  this wonder, like how's that guy, what is he saying about me when I'm not around? How does he feel
*  about me? Does he feel like he got over on me? Does he feel like he, did he fuck me over? Did he
*  disrespect me? So much of it is like, we're not supposed to communicate any other way other than
*  like you and I are doing right now. Look at each other in the eyes. I know you're not full of shit.
*  You know I'm not full of shit and we get to talk. That's how people are supposed to communicate.
*  And it used to be in a little village where, you know, you just, if you had a problem, you talked
*  to that person. And if you were a shitty person, if you were acting shitty, everybody knew you were
*  shitty. And you got a little bit ostracized for it. Yes. Yes. Definitely. There was correction.
*  And gossip was healthy. A little bit of gossip was good. It was like going, hey, that's Bill,
*  he rapes. Yeah. That's the gossip today. This guy likes to get five pounds of ground beef stuffed
*  his ass. Why? I don't know why. Do you need to fart? Cause Johnny over there,
*  he'll give you five bucks if you fucking throw it in his face. He likes it. What? Yeah. He's
*  going to beat off while you fart. That's it. That's what he likes. He doesn't want you to touch him.
*  Just fart in his face and then kick him in the balls. He's always feeding on the girls.
*  You ever watch those videos of guys that like, they like it and kicking the balls? Yeah, I've seen that.
*  I mean, they really get kicked in the balls. Like hard. Stomp. You could die from that.
*  Guys get their balls stomped with stilettos. That's a really common thing.
*  Like, ah, ah, ah, and they're getting stomped. Like guys lose testicles. Yeah. I know a guy who lost
*  a testicle cause he got kicked and he didn't have a cup on and he was sparring just like, he's like,
*  I'll do one more round. So he spars and he gets slammed in the fucking sack with a shin
*  and his testicle burst. Burst. And these guys are just letting some chicks stomp on them with a
*  stiletto heel. Yeah. I was fucking around with Dave Vada one time when I was in like 10th grade
*  and we were wrestling around and he reached down and grabbed my balls really hard and squoze them
*  like a fucking nut. He was a little bit of a nut and I remember laying on the ground for like 10
*  minutes being in like the most severe pain I've ever been in my life. Dude, I thought it was sterile
*  for a long time. Cause of getting kicked in the ball. I've been kicked in the balls at least a
*  hundred times hard by black belts. Like I've been kicked in the balls, dude, like many, many, many
*  times. Were they trying to kick you in the balls? No, no. You clash. Yeah. Like say if you're throwing
*  a kick with your right leg and I'm throwing a kick with my right leg and we throw them at the same
*  time and you just were moving weird. Sometimes it just goes right in the sack. Yeah. Sometimes a kick
*  will deflect, you know, like someone will be hitting you and you're trying to hit them in the
*  chest, but inadvertently they catch part of your leg and it redirects it right towards their balls.
*  Cups don't really cover your balls. That's the- They do. New ones do. Yeah. The old ones didn't.
*  There's a new, well, there's a company called Diamond MMA and I wear their cup when I do Jiu-Jitsu
*  and it's a compression short with all these straps built in and this cup that it's got like
*  a more flexible foam rubber on the outside and then a very hard rubber that covers the outside edge
*  rather and a very hard rubber that covers like the sack and the dick and then it fits very snugly to
*  your body and you can get kicked in the balls pretty hard with those. Wow. Yeah, it's a giant
*  improvement. Yeah. But when I was a kid, we didn't have that. No. We had a cup that slid into a jock
*  strap and it barely held in place and one time I was in a tournament and I got kicked in the ball
*  so fucking- I was pretty sure this guy did it on purpose. He was a mean fuck. I was fighting this
*  Korean dude. He was very good and very mean and I'm pretty sure he kicked me in the balls on purpose
*  because I punched him in the face on purpose right afterwards. Yeah. I was pretty sure. Yeah.
*  But my ball, my cup slammed into my ball so the cup did worse than protect me, than not protect me.
*  It actually became a weapon against my ball. Right. So the cup slammed into my ball. My ball
*  swole up. It was awful. It was so- What were those cups protecting? Pretty much your shaft
*  but not your balls. They do protect your balls a little bit under the ideal circumstances. Like
*  something comes at it straight on and it hits the cup. It's way better to hit the cup than it is to
*  hit your balls by themselves. It's definitely better. But- It's like a bicycle helmet. They made
*  Taekwondo cups that we used to wear on the outside that were even better because you'd wear them.
*  You'd have your pants on, your like your gi pants and then you would put the cup on over the pants
*  and it was- they were like more sturdy and they would tie on. They would hold them in place and
*  it was a little more material there so it was like it would cover your junk better. Yeah. But still.
*  Your sack is just a fucking terrible design. It is a bad design. Balls on the outside.
*  Dangling in midair. Just waiting to be hurt. You ever sit on your ball?
*  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You ever cut your dick in a zipper?
*  No. Never?
*  No. Oh my god.
*  We're underwear. I've done- I've gone fucking commando before and caught my dick in a zipper.
*  Yeah. It's like-
*  The crown?
*  No. The shaft. Somewhere in the side of the shaft. I caught it in the zipper. It was bleeding.
*  No sex for a while after that.
*  Yeah because then you have to explain.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what's on your dick? Oh I fucking caught it in the zipper.
*  You fucking liar. You fucking liar. You're gonna give me a disease. You're such a piece of shit.
*  That's why they invented Buttonfly.
*  Yeah. Probably right? Well I think Buttonfly was first.
*  Was it?
*  Yeah. I think the old Levi's. I think they were all Buttonfly. They hadn't figured out zippers yet.
*  Yeah.
*  Like zippers. Like let's guess. When do you think they invented the zipper?
*  I want to say like the 1800s.
*  Yeah I think the- I thought the original Levi jeans had zippers.
*  Don't think so. I think they're originally- I think that's why they called them the
*  original Buttonfly. Right? Like 501s. Original 501 jeans.
*  Yeah.
*  Buttonflies.
*  I remember dry humping. I was a fucking dry humper in junior high school man.
*  Dry humping machine?
*  Dude I would go all night. I would get it. I was gifted and you know you try to get your cock
*  right in the middle there. Right in the spot.
*  And then I was perfect. And I remember one time getting a scab. I got so raw I had a scab on it.
*  Jesus dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you nut from dry humping?
*  A couple times. But I was pretty restrained.
*  Well you gotta- if you dry hump the right way to do it is with silk pajamas.
*  Oh.
*  No underwear.
*  Nice.
*  Right? If I could go back in time I would talk to my old self. Hey dickhead.
*  You're gonna get some eighth grade-
*  Why are you wearing fucking these corduroys?
*  You're showing up at some girl's house. She's in eighth grade. Dad answers the door.
*  Why are you wearing silk- silk pajama pants?
*  I'm just really into silk. Reading a lot about trade with China.
*  Is Irene here?
*  She comes down.
*  Are you wearing underwear you piece of shit? What? Huh? You think I'm stupid?
*  I'm married. I have children. All right? I've had sex you little fuck.
*  I know what you're doing. You want to dry hump my kid.
*  She comes down and she's wearing silk pajamas.
*  What the fuck is going on here?
*  Get out of here.
*  Dry humping man.
*  Good old days. Remember you grab a titty you were so happy.
*  Can't believe I'm holding a tit.
*  Outside the shirt I was happy.
*  Oh yeah. Outrageous. Yeah. You were so happy. This is so much better than not holding a tit.
*  It's as good as it gets.
*  And then if you were a girl- I felt bad for girls back then because
*  how annoying would it be that somebody's just grabbing-
*  My wife must know what we're talking about. Just call me right now.
*  That you're just grabbing their tit and you can't stop.
*  Like she's got her bra on, you wedged your hand under her bra.
*  And you're just grabbing. Just squeezing.
*  Yeah.
*  That's not pleasurable for her.
*  No. Definitely not.
*  But they did it.
*  Maybe she did like it. Maybe she just liked the fact she's naughty.
*  Yeah.
*  So naughty.
*  I couldn't fathom that girls were enjoying fooling around for a long time.
*  I really thought that they were just being nice.
*  Dude, I couldn't imagine that girls like boys. Like why do you even like me?
*  Yeah.
*  Like why do you like boys? Boys are so gross.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I remember being a kid thinking that man, I'm so happy that girls like boys,
*  but I don't understand it. Like it doesn't make sense. Like why would they like us?
*  Like we don't- it's- we don't have any of the good things that they have.
*  Yeah.
*  They have tits. They get wet. They're pretty.
*  We're dirty.
*  We're gross. They wear makeup. We don't. We're gross.
*  We're stupid.
*  Yeah, we're dumb as fuck. We are dumber too. Like the whole process of men developing and
*  getting testosterone and going through the whole cycle of adulthood,
*  it's just a fact that women mature quicker. They're smarter at an earlier age.
*  So when you're 15, you got to have a 14 year old girlfriend because if you have a 15 year old
*  girlfriend, she's like, you fucking idiot. Damn. Got to get someone smarter.
*  If I get someone smarter. Like if you're- like how many guys who are 18 have a 17 year old girlfriend?
*  A lot.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. But how many guys who are 18 have a 19 year old girlfriend? 19 year old girls don't want to
*  have anything to do with an 18 year old moron.
*  No.
*  No, they're smarter already.
*  Yeah.
*  They're looking for a 22 year old.
*  Yep. No, it's so true. Like my daughter said that. She's like, I can't- she goes,
*  I can't even talk to guys my age.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  She wants a couple of ages. They're smarter.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't have to go through that whole testosterone thing.
*  All you're thinking about is getting rid of loads.
*  Yeah.
*  That's- you're barely thinking about anything else. Studying in school.
*  Oh.
*  I know. Jesus.
*  Yeah. It was pretty much playing sports and having an orgasm. That was high school.
*  Yes. And as soon as you found out about orgasms, sports took a backseat.
*  Yeah.
*  A big backseat.
*  Yeah.
*  I used to do a bit about that. My dad was like, hey, how come you're not playing baseball anymore?
*  Yeah. I found this new thing and I'm way better at this. I like it more. It's more fun.
*  I always win. Every game.
*  Every time you come, you win. Yay. The crowd cheers. It's like Trump.
*  Make America great again. Yes.
*  Ah.
*  If you come, you win. You win. As long as the girl's not mad at you.
*  Yeah.
*  If you come, the girl's like, what the fuck? You're like, oh shit. Now my good moment is done.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It has to be well placed.
*  Dude, it's already 6 PM. Believe it or not.
*  Jesus Christ. Really?
*  Yeah. Let's wrap this bitch up. Greg, tell everybody where you're going to be.
*  Oh Jesus.
*  With your hilarious standup comedy.
*  I'm going to be at the punchline in San Francisco this weekend.
*  Oh shit. One of my favorite clubs of all time.
*  It's the best. And then I'm coming up. I'm going to be in Kansas City after that. And then I'm
*  going to be in Denver, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Atlantic City. Go to FitzDog.com. Get all your
*  tickets for all those places. Woo. See you tomorrow, folks. Bye everybody. Much love.
*  Bye.
