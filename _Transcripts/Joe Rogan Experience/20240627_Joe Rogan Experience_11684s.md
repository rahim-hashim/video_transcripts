*  I really do. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=78.72s)]
*  It's rock solid, dude. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=79.72s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=80.72s)]
*  That set that I saw you do at the Creek in the Cave, it's so well put together. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=81.72s)]
*  It's thematic, but it's not. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=84.72s)]
*  It's just a club special. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=86.72s)]
*  It's fucking great, dude. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=88.08s)]
*  I saw you run that a while ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=90.08s)]
*  I remember I hit you up like, you gotta shoot this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=93.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, I don't know what I'm supposed to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=96.08s)]
*  You have to shoot it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=98.08s)]
*  Fucking world shutdown. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=99.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=100.08s)]
*  Well, you wait. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=101.08s)]
*  World restarts, and now you're releasing it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=102.08s)]
*  It's going to be even better. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=103.56s)]
*  I think it's better now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=105.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so, too. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=106.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=107.0s)]
*  When I put stuff away, you get back to it after a year and a half. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=108.0s)]
*  You see a shirt you haven't seen in a while, and you're like, I love this. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=109.48s)]
*  It's like when I saw it the other way, I was like, oh, these setups are way too long. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so you actually made it much better. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=117.28s)]
*  Yeah, for real. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=119.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=120.28s)]
*  That's always how it happens, though. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=121.28s)]
*  I just like, that fucking quote you always had on your laptop is such a great quote. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=122.28s)]
*  The first draft of everything is shit. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=126.84s)]
*  First draft of anything is shit, Hemingway. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=128.4s)]
*  Such a great quote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=130.24s)]
*  Hemingway is a bad bitch. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=131.24s)]
*  He knew how to name a special. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=132.24s)]
*  It was Bill. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=133.72s)]
*  Or a book. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=134.72s)]
*  It was Bill Hemingway. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=135.72s)]
*  It's his cousin. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=136.72s)]
*  Hey, where's the fucking, where's the booze? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=137.72s)]
*  The booze? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=138.72s)]
*  Already? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=139.72s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=140.72s)]
*  I were bad! [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=141.72s)]
*  It's in front of your face. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=142.72s)]
*  No, better. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=143.72s)]
*  You found it already? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=144.72s)]
*  It's gone, baby. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=145.72s)]
*  Is it 21 years old? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=147.44s)]
*  I don't know, it's so smooth. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=148.44s)]
*  People died to bring this here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=149.44s)]
*  I feel like it's World War II. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=150.44s)]
*  Or even better, guys. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=151.44s)]
*  It smells like Scotland in somebody's butthole. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=152.44s)]
*  Did you say that you did sip that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=153.44s)]
*  I sipped it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=154.44s)]
*  It was fucking beautiful. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=155.44s)]
*  Tastes like syrup. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=156.44s)]
*  With a fucking slurpy straw. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=157.44s)]
*  We were talking about that video. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=158.44s)]
*  Cheers, Bergen. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=159.44s)]
*  About you never quitting drinking. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=160.44s)]
*  About how goddamn inspiring that is. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=161.44s)]
*  Jack Osborne hit me up last night. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=162.44s)]
*  Jack, I hope you're cool with this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=163.44s)]
*  And he was like, I've been sober 19 years and I just watched this video. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=164.44s)]

*  This is going to be the best day ever. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=223.44s)]
*  Dude, you just hyped me the fuck up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=227.44s)]
*  That was like a locker room speech. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=231.44s)]
*  Dude, I fucking yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=234.44s)]
*  You're back. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=236.44s)]
*  Yes, I'm back and it feels so good like a warm blanket that you grew up with. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=237.44s)]
*  But it also felt good to be sober, you were saying. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=241.44s)]
*  It felt fucking amazing. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=244.44s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=246.44s)]
*  It felt amazing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=247.44s)]
*  They both feel amazing. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=248.44s)]
*  For you, more than anybody I know, this is part of your identity. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=249.44s)]
*  But it is as much as it is the average dude. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=253.44s)]
*  No. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=257.44s)]
*  No. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=258.44s)]
*  No. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=259.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=260.44s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=261.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=262.44s)]
*  That is a false statement. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=263.44s)]
*  Fact checkers on Twitter disagree with that statement. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=265.44s)]
*  The government fact checking is going to have an issue with it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=268.44s)]
*  They might shut down my podcast. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=271.44s)]
*  My identity is, my thing is life is living. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=272.44s)]
*  I like to live. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=277.44s)]
*  I'm like most people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=278.44s)]
*  No, but I like to live life. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=280.44s)]
*  You go for it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=282.44s)]
*  I like to go after it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=283.44s)]
*  I like to feel it. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=284.44s)]
*  I like spontaneity. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=285.44s)]
*  I love not knowing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=286.44s)]
*  I love the gamble. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=288.44s)]
*  I love all of it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=289.44s)]
*  And I fucking love, I love the feeling when you get a text from you and you're like, hey, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=290.44s)]
*  what are you doing today? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=296.44s)]
*  You want to go podcast? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=297.44s)]
*  And you're like, come on over, we'll get fucking wasted. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=298.44s)]
*  It's the fucking greatest. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=300.44s)]
*  It hasn't hit me yet. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=301.44s)]
*  It hasn't hit me yet. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=303.44s)]
*  I just, I'm waiting for it to fucking cover me. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=304.44s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=307.44s)]
*  It's nice to be away from it, but it's nice to be back at it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=308.44s)]
*  The thing with marijuana with me is writing. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=312.44s)]
*  I was telling you today, like the first day I did my routine, which is either in the morning, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=314.44s)]
*  I usually get up early, everybody goes to school, and I fucking spark up. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=319.44s)]
*  I spark up and I write. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=325.44s)]
*  Is that pretty routine for you? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=326.44s)]
*  It has been. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=327.44s)]
*  It was for the last few months before October. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=329.44s)]
*  In the morning? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=331.44s)]
*  In the morning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=332.44s)]
*  I used to do it late at night after shows, and I still do, but there's a thing where [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=333.44s)]
*  I'm tired. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=336.44s)]
*  Late at night after shows, I force myself to write, but I don't think it's as good. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=337.44s)]
*  I think in the morning, sometimes I have some of my best ideas. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=341.44s)]
*  Your brain's so rested, sorry, Tom. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=344.44s)]
*  No, no, when you do that, because I don't do that, when you do that and you start writing, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=345.44s)]
*  is it, is your mindset in this, I'm writing material? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=349.44s)]
*  You're trying to write material, or is it literally just stream of consciousness, whatever [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=353.44s)]
*  comes out? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=357.44s)]
*  It's stream of consciousness about subjects. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=358.44s)]
*  Okay, so you bring up the topic. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=360.44s)]
*  You have the topics? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=361.44s)]
*  Yeah, like today I did. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=362.44s)]
*  Luckily, I had an idea that I wanted to fuck with. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=364.44s)]
*  And so then once I start writing, I'm not writing, because if I write within the confines [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=367.44s)]
*  of this has to be material, it would be too constrained. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=370.44s)]
*  I'm like, I got to set up punchlines, set up punchlines. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=374.44s)]
*  Right, because then it feels like it has to go right. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=376.44s)]
*  So it could literally be something like a gun control, like something, a topic. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=377.44s)]
*  Yes, I just write almost like an essay, but I'll repeat myself over and over again in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=380.44s)]
*  the essay, like I'll start again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=385.44s)]
*  Like I'll start with the subject this way, I'll go, you know, one more time, we'll try [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=387.44s)]
*  it this way again. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=390.44s)]
*  And then I'll do it again. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=391.44s)]
*  And I'm just trying to extract stuff. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=392.44s)]
*  Yeah, because ideally you want to get to every piece of it that you think about, like South [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=394.44s)]
*  Park, where they'll cover all sides. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=397.44s)]
*  I think Carlin wrote like that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=399.44s)]
*  Yeah, I get seeds that way. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=401.44s)]
*  And then those seeds I bring on stage and they walk out there like Bambi on ice. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=403.44s)]
*  They're all like fucking wobbly and shit. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=407.44s)]
*  But if I just stick with them, eventually I know the process. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=409.44s)]
*  It'll become one of my best bits. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=413.44s)]
*  It just have to, as long as I'm being honest, like there's some bits I've just had to abandon. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=415.44s)]
*  You have to suffer if it's suffering. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=419.44s)]
*  You have to sit through the suffering some. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=420.44s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=422.44s)]
*  But then sometimes you got to go, this one's never going to work. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=423.44s)]
*  It's like, do you find yourself veering away from anything personal when you start writing? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=425.44s)]
*  Do you do topic or do you find yourself like, because I'm mostly story based. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=428.44s)]
*  So I'm trying to mine shit that's happened to me. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=435.44s)]
*  You get a story and you're like, now let me really think about it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=437.44s)]
*  Lately, there's been so much confusion in the world politically and culturally. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=441.44s)]
*  It's kind of easy to have things to talk about, but hard to figure out how to make them unique and funny. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=446.44s)]
*  You don't want the same hot take that everybody has. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=451.44s)]
*  It's like, you want to figure out what is it about this that's weird to me? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=454.44s)]
*  And how do I make this into an idea that's funny? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=458.44s)]
*  I always said that when I first started out, all I wanted to do was get laughs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=461.44s)]
*  So comedy was just like a tool. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=465.44s)]
*  It was like a ruler or a hammer or a screwdriver. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=467.44s)]
*  I was just trying to make it work. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=470.44s)]
*  And then I was like, what do I think is funny? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=472.44s)]
*  Let me make stuff that I would actually go to see because some of my stuff I didn't think was funny. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=474.44s)]
*  I was just doing it because it got laughs. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=478.44s)]
*  That's really funny. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=480.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=481.44s)]
*  Hold on, am I hearing this right? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=482.44s)]
*  So that's a very funny premise that you write. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=484.44s)]
*  You get up on stage for the first time and all of a sudden you go, oh shit, I have a hammer. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=486.44s)]
*  But now you're using a hammer to get a screw out of a wall. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=491.44s)]
*  Using a hammer to get like you only get a couple tools and you're using them for everything. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=493.44s)]
*  And the better you get, the more tools you get. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=498.44s)]
*  And you're like, oh shit, I can use this screwdriver just for unscrewing screws. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=501.44s)]
*  Yeah, but it's more of like I started writing comedy that I would think was funny that I would laugh at. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=505.44s)]
*  Whereas I wasn't doing that at first. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=511.44s)]
*  I don't think you could actually end up failing if you stick to that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=513.44s)]
*  Yeah, if you just do stuff that you think is funny. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=515.44s)]
*  If you think that's funny. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=518.44s)]
*  That took a while for me to figure out, though. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=519.44s)]
*  It took me a while to figure out that I was getting laughs with stuff that I wouldn't pay to see. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=522.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=526.44s)]

*  You were flying like a really, really old set. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=531.44s)]
*  Oh, I got some sets for like 93, they're death. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=534.44s)]
*  Yeah, you should post that. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=536.44s)]
*  Fucking death. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=537.44s)]
*  Well, there's one that's out there, the MTV half hour comedy hour. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=539.44s)]

*  Oh, so dumb. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=546.44s)]
*  Dumb now, but I was really dumb then. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=547.44s)]
*  But it's just then I figured out how to do things that I would laugh at. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=549.44s)]
*  That was like right around the time I was figuring that out. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=553.44s)]
*  And then it's figuring out like what's the don't just accept it the way it is. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=555.44s)]
*  Edit that shit down. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=559.44s)]

*  Try it a different way. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=563.44s)]
*  Figure out a way. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=564.44s)]
*  And one of the things I learned over the pandemic is like you give a bit two years or you give a special two years. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=565.44s)]
*  It's going to be pretty good. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=570.44s)]
*  Give a special four years. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=571.44s)]
*  Like it's better. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=572.44s)]

*  Well, Kanye, this is the way I've described it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=652.44s)]
*  I'm going to describe it in the most charitable way possible. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=655.44s)]
*  The same thing that makes him a great artist. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=657.44s)]
*  He's like, boom, bam, boom. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=659.44s)]
*  It's like one thing to another and every rap flows with the fucking beat. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=661.44s)]

*  He's on the throttle. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=669.44s)]
*  He's working the blinkers. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=670.44s)]

*  He's a genius. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=673.44s)]
*  When you apply that same thing to conversation, you want to dominate the conversation. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=674.44s)]
*  You want to say and then enforce what you're saying and then like try to try to figure out a way to make what you're saying valid. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=681.44s)]
*  Even if it's not, you're like wrestling with your initial idea that you put out there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=689.44s)]
*  Just you're experiencing pushback. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=694.44s)]

*  No. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  In LA? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1044.1200000000001s)]
*  We were doing Fear Factor. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1045.76s)]
*  Women's slaves? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1046.76s)]
*  Dude. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1047.76s)]
*  Wait, what? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1048.76s)]
*  Yeah, listen. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1049.76s)]
*  We were doing Fear Factor. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1050.76s)]
*  So we're working in this downtown LA building of warehouses and it's crazy. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1052.2399999999998s)]
*  The weirdest setup. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  One floor would be entirely abandoned and broken down and nothing. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1061.6s)]
*  Wires hanging from the ceiling, windows all blown out. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1066.6s)]
*  You go up one stairway through one door and all of a sudden there's a working factory. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1069.8s)]
*  Like what? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1075.0s)]
*  This is wild shit. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1076.0s)]
*  Like downtown LA... [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1077.0s)]
*  This was way before everybody knew what Skid Row was. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1078.0s)]
*  Well, most people in LA knew of Skid Row. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1081.3999999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't like a shanty town that expanded out through Santa Monica and Venice and all [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1083.96s)]
*  the wild shit they're dealing with now. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1088.3999999999999s)]
*  That existed when we were filming Fear Factor. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1090.04s)]
*  So we would go to these warehouses and I went into one of them and it was where they made [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  American Apparel. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1097.6s)]
*  And so we'd go up the stairs and you're seeing like a sweatshop. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1099.8s)]
*  But it's in America. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1104.36s)]
*  And you're seeing people, they're all speaking Spanish. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1105.84s)]
*  There's all Mexican music. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1108.16s)]
*  People are talking in Spanish. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1110.6s)]
*  And they're from wherever they got to there and now they're working here. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1112.8799999999999s)]
*  You're like, whoa. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1116.68s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1117.68s)]
*  At least they're protected by American laws. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1118.68s)]
*  They're getting American wages. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1120.8s)]
*  And I mean, there's no saying that they weren't doing that. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1122.6s)]
*  But it was weird. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1126.04s)]
*  It's like you walked into another country. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1127.04s)]
*  Is it made in America? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1130.6399999999999s)]
*  It's made in America by people who definitely didn't come from America. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1131.68s)]
*  And they should definitely have that opportunity to do that. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1136.3200000000002s)]
*  It's all beautiful and everything. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1138.76s)]
*  But like being in this weird downtown LA thing, like made in America. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1139.76s)]
*  You picture like fucking redheaded dudes stitching together flannel shirts. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1143.44s)]
*  It is not that. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1146.92s)]
*  I remember buying American Apparel for my shirt. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1147.92s)]
*  They cost two bucks more. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1150.2800000000002s)]
*  I'd be like, no, no, it's the right thing to do. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1151.2800000000002s)]
*  But on one side, like, yeah, it is good. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1153.8000000000002s)]
*  Like they do have to give these people whatever the wages are supposed to be and they have [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1155.68s)]
*  to give them as long. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1159.0800000000002s)]
*  But it's weird when you see these factories. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1161.24s)]
*  You're like, wow, these people are humping. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1163.04s)]
*  That's now. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1165.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1166.56s)]
*  That's now. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1167.56s)]
*  You really timestamp something with masks. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1168.56s)]
*  Yeah, because it used to be like when you thought of people manufacturing things in [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1170.56s)]
*  a sweatshop, you feel like they're doing it against their will. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1177.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1180.6000000000001s)]
*  But if you got to America, if you snuck out of another country and got to America, that's [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1181.6000000000001s)]
*  like a good job to get. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1184.8400000000001s)]
*  You can get a good job working in wherever where you can actually bring home the kind [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1186.28s)]
*  of money that's impossible where you're from. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1190.4s)]
*  Joey used to have a good bit about it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1192.44s)]
*  You should wear Nikes because they only make a quarter an hour or something like quarter [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1194.2800000000002s)]
*  a day. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1197.92s)]
*  You're like, maybe you should move. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1198.92s)]
*  Was it? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1199.92s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1200.92s)]
*  Your country sucks if you're going to make a quarter. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1201.92s)]
*  I don't remember how that joke went. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1203.92s)]
*  It was Joey's? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1204.92s)]
*  It was Joe Rogan's. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1205.92s)]
*  Oh, Joe's. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1206.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1207.92s)]
*  Maybe you should quit. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1208.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1209.92s)]
*  Maybe you should ask for a raise. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1210.92s)]
*  That job sucks. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1211.92s)]
*  I don't know what to tell you. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1212.92s)]
*  That job sucks. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1213.92s)]
*  I need a pair of sneakers. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1214.92s)]
*  They're 30 bucks. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1215.92s)]
*  They're $20. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1216.92s)]
*  I'm going to get some sneakers. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1218.44s)]
*  It was a cadence. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1221.44s)]
*  It was a cadence. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1222.44s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1223.44s)]
*  I was like, I don't know what the fuck you want me to do. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1224.44s)]
*  This is bigger than me. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1226.76s)]
*  I need sneakers. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1227.76s)]
*  What is the? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1229.1200000000001s)]
*  I need to fix the world. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1230.1200000000001s)]
*  Our sweatshop's illegal. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1231.44s)]
*  In 2016, the DOL investigated 77 garment factories in Los Angeles who produce clothing for the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1232.44s)]
*  aforementioned brands and found egregious labor violations in 85% of the factories it [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1238.8000000000002s)]
*  visited. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1245.6000000000001s)]
*  I was on the back, Los Angeles. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1247.28s)]
*  You're really doing the right thing. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1248.28s)]
*  Forever 21, Ross and TJ Maxx have been major offenders in regards to utilizing sweatshops [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1249.76s)]
*  located in United States. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1256.12s)]
*  So that's what I saw. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1258.56s)]
*  Have you seen these sweatshops at Ross Films? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1260.3999999999999s)]
*  But again, I don't know what they were getting paid. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1261.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if there was any violations. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1264.3999999999999s)]
*  I just knew. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1266.0s)]
*  But you saw some shady surroundings. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1267.0s)]
*  It didn't look great. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1268.0s)]
*  The surroundings sucked. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1269.0s)]
*  The neighborhoods sucked. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1271.1999999999998s)]
*  It was a weird mess of abandoned buildings and homeless people camped out. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1274.56s)]
*  I took a wrong turn and went down where Skid Row is. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1280.0s)]
*  I didn't try to drive down where all the tents and all the people were, but I passed by it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1284.72s)]
*  I got to see it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1289.6399999999999s)]
*  I was like, this is madness. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1290.6399999999999s)]
*  We're talking about 2004 or something like that. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1293.84s)]
*  Do you remember when it was a block? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1295.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1296.84s)]
*  It was just there on the block. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1297.84s)]
*  It was just that one area. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1298.84s)]
*  And you're like, wow. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1299.84s)]
*  And then it just started spreading. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1300.84s)]
*  But it's been contained for a while. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1301.84s)]
*  Now it's Hollywood. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1302.84s)]
*  It's crazy that people are tolerant of that. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1304.6s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1307.56s)]
*  It's kind of nice because you get to see people's true Republican come out. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1308.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1313.6s)]
*  Well, you push it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1314.6s)]
*  You push it to what they're having to deal with. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1315.6s)]
*  These liberals. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm a liberal, obviously. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  But the liberal, I mean, I'm fucking everyone. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1320.9599999999998s)]
*  You have a goddamn redneck. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1323.76s)]
*  I do. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1324.76s)]
*  I look like a racist. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1325.76s)]
*  You definitely fall into what people would think. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1326.76s)]
*  Not a racist, but like not a liberal. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1328.48s)]
*  I look horrible. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1330.52s)]
*  I don't look like... [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1331.52s)]
*  You look like, you know, you... [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1332.52s)]
*  You had a Confederate flag t-shirt on at one point in your life. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1334.2s)]
*  I've never had it. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1336.68s)]
*  At one point you were a Dukes of Hazard fan. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1337.68s)]
*  You like Kid Rock. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1339.32s)]
*  At least you like Kid Rock. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1340.32s)]
*  I find it harder with Kid Rock. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1341.32s)]
*  We had a Leonard Skinner poster that was in our bathroom. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1343.0s)]
*  There was a tour poster that had a Confederate flag. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1347.12s)]
*  I didn't even realize it had it on. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1350.2s)]
*  I didn't even think of it. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1351.36s)]
*  It's just a Leonard Skinner tour poster with them with the Rolling Stones. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1352.36s)]
*  But it was a Confederate flag. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1354.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1356.68s)]
*  It's everywhere. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1357.68s)]
*  There was one flying. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1358.68s)]
*  I remember seeing on this tour outside of, you know, like in the proximity of the venue [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm playing. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1365.28s)]
*  We were like, is everybody just flying? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1366.28s)]
*  How about the ones that are built into the state flag? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1367.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1369.8400000000001s)]
*  I think those are down. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1370.8400000000001s)]
*  Are they all gone? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1371.8400000000001s)]
*  I was just in... [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1372.8400000000001s)]
*  I think Miss... [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  Pull up Miss Sippies. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1374.8400000000001s)]
*  I feel like that's real recent. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  There was one flying. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1376.8400000000001s)]
*  Six Flags Over Georgia got taken down. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  Just flying high and proud. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1379.8s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1381.76s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1382.76s)]
*  We're not used to it. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1383.76s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1384.76s)]
*  But I mean, that is... [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1385.76s)]
*  Like, that's one of those things where you're like, it's just Pride for the South. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1387.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1391.44s)]
*  But it's the side that lost that was in a war against the other side. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1392.6s)]
*  Are you still like harboring bad feelings? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1396.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1398.24s)]
*  It's the side that lost. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1399.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1400.24s)]
*  How do you get to keep your flag? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1401.24s)]
*  Well, don't believe that. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1402.24s)]
*  No matter what, it represents something. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1403.24s)]
*  It totally does. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1407.52s)]
*  And you can't... [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1408.52s)]
*  And you don't... [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1409.52s)]
*  Maybe you need a new one. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1410.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1411.52s)]
*  Maybe you need a new Southern Pride, everybody inclusive flag. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1412.52s)]
*  Unless you're lying to yourself about what the Civil War was about, because people do [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1415.84s)]
*  that. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1419.84s)]
*  Well, that was... [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1420.84s)]
*  It was about trade. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1421.84s)]
*  That was taught when I was in high school. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1422.84s)]
*  That was taught in high school. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1424.24s)]
*  It was not about slavery. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1425.24s)]
*  In my high school, they said it's not about slavery. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1426.52s)]
*  They taught us that too. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1429.48s)]
*  It was about trade. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1430.48s)]
*  It was about free market. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1431.48s)]
*  It was about taxes. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1432.48s)]
*  And it was only about slavery. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1433.48s)]
*  It was about slavery. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1435.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1436.48s)]
*  You think so, really? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1437.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1438.48s)]
*  That's really what they taught us. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1439.48s)]
*  It was about trade and free gas. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1440.48s)]
*  It was 100% about slavery. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1441.48s)]
*  But then again, they also showed us a third trimester abortion in religion class. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1442.48s)]
*  Where they break the baby apart. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1446.24s)]
*  Where they break the baby apart. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1447.24s)]
*  Where they break the baby apart. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1448.24s)]
*  They break the baby apart. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1449.24s)]
*  And we're like fucking 15, 16. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1450.24s)]
*  They show a pussy and we go nuts. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1453.24s)]
*  We're like, fuck. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1455.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1456.76s)]
*  She's like, never looked at the seizure. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1457.76s)]
*  Like, pussy. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1458.76s)]
*  And then they started breaking a baby apart inside a woman and pulling it out. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1459.76s)]
*  And we were like, what the fuck? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1465.44s)]
*  The day it became a comic. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1467.44s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1468.44s)]
*  This one was like, I've got my first 15 minutes. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1469.44s)]
*  Everyone's like asking me... [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1472.44s)]
*  I was in high school. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  Give me a notebook. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1475.3600000000001s)]
*  Next thing you know. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1476.3600000000001s)]
*  I was saying to Tom today... [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1478.16s)]
*  That's so gross. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1480.24s)]
*  That's so atrocious. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1481.24s)]
*  I never had an abortion. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1482.24s)]
*  Imagine showing that to a kid and thinking that's the right way to handle it. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1484.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1487.8s)]
*  Like before their parents get to talk to them about it. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1488.8s)]
*  Like, you don't... [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1490.76s)]
*  Do you have to sign a waiver? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1491.76s)]
*  You just traumatize the shit out of them. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1492.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1493.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1494.76s)]
*  We're gonna waver. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1495.76s)]
*  I gotta be honest with you. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1496.76s)]
*  I mean, I could call someone and find out exactly. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1497.76s)]
*  I want to say it was ninth grade and I want to say they'd played it in English class. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1502.04s)]
*  It's rough. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1506.04s)]
*  Like I don't even think it was religion. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1507.04s)]
*  I think it was English. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1508.04s)]
*  That was a hodlber teacher who was like, what am I allowed to play? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1509.04s)]
*  I don't feel like it's... [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1511.4s)]
*  What's on the list? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1512.4s)]
*  I want them to shut the fuck up. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1513.4s)]
*  My buddy. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1514.4s)]
*  There's also teachers that feel like they have to explain things to kids that the kids [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1515.4s)]
*  aren't learning from their parents. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1518.84s)]
*  Truth. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1520.2s)]
*  And there's a good argument on both sides of that, right? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1521.2s)]
*  There's a good argument like, hey, I don't want you teaching my kids something that I [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1522.72s)]
*  don't want to teach them. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1525.76s)]
*  And then the other argument is, you know what? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1526.96s)]
*  Maybe it's the job of the educator to expose your kid to ideas that maybe they won't get [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1529.1200000000001s)]
*  at home. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1533.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't want to teach math. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1534.16s)]
*  But it's like, at what point in time does he cross that line? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1535.16s)]
*  It's a valid discussion. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1537.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a valid discussion. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1538.16s)]
*  It came up recently a lot and it made me really think about it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1539.16s)]
*  They're like, I don't want my kids learning that, all that whatever stuff. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1541.6000000000001s)]
*  And it was like, oh yeah, I guess you should have the right... [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1544.68s)]
*  You kind of should, but also maybe not. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1547.48s)]
*  You know, the problem is like exposing people to only one narrow band of ideas, that doesn't [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1550.76s)]
*  seem fair to a kid either. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1556.0800000000002s)]
*  I think the kids should be exposed to as many ideas as possible, but from rational discussions. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1558.84s)]
*  Not from like propagandizing and trying to push one thing or another. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1565.14s)]
*  And that's the problem when people differ ideologically. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1569.98s)]
*  When people are on the right or people are on the left and people think this or they [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1572.98s)]
*  think that. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1575.78s)]
*  If you force something that they don't believe on a kid, it's like, whose job is that? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1577.3799999999999s)]
*  You can learn about taxation without representation at school and then you go home to like a Jewish [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1581.22s)]

*  We went to a high school for Georgia when Georgia was looking at high schools and seemed [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1599.22s)]
*  cool and then all of a sudden one of the mom raises her hand and she goes, hey, is it true [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1603.82s)]
*  that you make the children of color stand on chairs and make the white children sit [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1608.9s)]
*  on the ground and they can yell at them? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1617.7800000000002s)]
*  And the lady goes, yeah, that is true. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1623.46s)]
*  And is it true you do it to the boys? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1625.7s)]
*  The boys sit down and the girls can yell horrific things at them. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1627.66s)]
*  This is 100% true. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1631.0600000000002s)]
*  And so that's where that line gets blurry. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1633.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's a school in LA. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1635.3400000000001s)]
*  It's a school in LA. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1637.38s)]
*  They have the children of color stand on chairs and yell slurs at the white kids. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1638.38s)]
*  Like privilege. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1644.7800000000002s)]
*  And so that's where that line gets blurry. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1646.74s)]
*  What wisdom is behind this decision? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1651.42s)]
*  What wisdom is behind this decision? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1653.8600000000001s)]
*  Why would you impose such a radical idea? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1655.8200000000002s)]
*  It's people running scared. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1657.8600000000001s)]
*  That's not fun. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1658.8600000000001s)]
*  But it's not necessarily. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1659.8600000000001s)]
*  It's like why do you think that you're so much smarter than everyone else that you could [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1660.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's going to equal equality. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1665.46s)]
*  That's going to somehow equal equity. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1668.1399999999999s)]
*  That's going to somehow balance it out. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1669.9399999999998s)]
*  Do they have a tail at the end saying this is why we're teaching this? [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1671.86s)]
*  Even with a fucking tail at the end, you're introducing conflict when you should be exciting [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1675.26s)]
*  unity. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1681.6599999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to be educating people and you're making kids responsible for the sins [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1682.6599999999999s)]
*  of the past. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1687.54s)]
*  But also I look back at that watching that abortion and I remember I know for a fact [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1688.58s)]
*  I won't say the guy's name but I was really good friends with the guy. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1695.54s)]
*  I ended up in New York together and I said that video really affected me. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1698.86s)]
*  It really affected me in a way that I know for a fact I would never get an abortion. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1704.18s)]
*  I would have been really upset. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1708.26s)]
*  And my buddy was like this money I've had six it didn't bother me at all. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1712.54s)]
*  And I was like really I've been a part of six abortions. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1716.06s)]
*  That video did not affect me in the slightest. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1719.46s)]
*  So I think it's one of those things you're going to put a white kid on the floor and [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1721.02s)]
*  have people of color yell at that white kid and he may see that as complete bullshit and [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1723.7s)]
*  it may affect the one white kid where it lands. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1728.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1731.66s)]
*  I mean maybe it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1732.66s)]
*  When we were leaving LA we had to check out schools because Ellis was getting ready to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1733.66s)]
*  go into kindergarten and the kindergartens in this area were like yeah you know he'll [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1738.82s)]
*  sign a racism pledge. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1743.38s)]
*  I was like what. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1745.06s)]
*  To be. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1746.26s)]
*  Yeah hopefully. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1747.26s)]
*  Anti race. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1749.82s)]
*  I was like he's five. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1750.82s)]
*  And they're like yeah we have all our race. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1752.6999999999998s)]
*  I go he doesn't. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1754.3799999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1755.3799999999999s)]
*  He's not even going to understand the concept of this shit. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1756.06s)]
*  He just figured out colors. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1757.9799999999998s)]
*  You're like he doesn't know anything about this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1759.54s)]
*  Now you want him to apply it to skin. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1760.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1762.26s)]
*  It's also a great thing 30 years later you get zero racism in your household. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1763.26s)]
*  So you're in the household and there's like the concept is even too rich for a child. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1766.74s)]
*  Not only is it's like it's like he's not going to be exposed to it from you. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1773.14s)]
*  Like the fact that you impose one blanket way of approaching any social issue to all [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1778.0200000000002s)]
*  kids. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1784.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1784.6200000000001s)]
*  Like that. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1784.94s)]
*  And then the year the one who gets to decide it's kind of a racism pledge. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1785.5s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1789.3000000000002s)]
*  I also can't wait for that phone call. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1790.3000000000002s)]
*  Like he was racist today and he signed this should be a building if we're going to do [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1791.8600000000001s)]
*  that we should have all offenses aggression like all kids express aggression. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1795.6200000000001s)]
*  They do. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1800.0200000000002s)]
*  They all say mean things to each other. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1800.3s)]
*  They're testing it out. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1802.26s)]
*  They don't even know what a pledge is. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1803.3s)]
*  Well it's also it's like it's part of learning how to communicate. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1804.78s)]
*  It shouldn't be encouraged. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1808.58s)]
*  Certain should certainly should be admonished when kids step out of line. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1809.86s)]
*  But that's how they learn how to talk to each other. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1813.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1815.58s)]
*  You know and not saying this about racism because racism is 100 percent learned but [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1816.22s)]
*  aggression is a real problem with kids. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1819.98s)]
*  That's true. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1822.14s)]
*  That's a giant problem. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1822.74s)]
*  You see it with like little children. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  Yes they're like the most. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1826.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1828.3s)]
*  They don't understand consequences. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1828.7s)]
*  And that is a big factor in why so many people are unhappy in life. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1830.8999999999999s)]
*  There's so many people that I've met that got fucking bullied in high school. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1835.46s)]
*  So they were tortured. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1839.3799999999999s)]
*  They were tortured for years. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1840.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1842.58s)]
*  And that shit scars you. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1843.1s)]
*  Even people that become like really ultimately successful. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1845.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1847.94s)]
*  And kids don't know they're doing it while they're doing it. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1848.34s)]
*  They're doing it because it's a natural fucking primate behavior. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1850.86s)]
*  They don't know how to regulate their emotions. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1855.1399999999999s)]
*  You see it when they're really small because my boys fuck each other up and [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1856.86s)]
*  everybody and everything all the time. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1859.5s)]
*  I'm imagining you know they're just always kicking at each other. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1861.26s)]
*  Yes they get frustrated and then all of a sudden it's just like bam back of the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1864.26s)]
*  head and you're like what are you doing. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1867.1799999999998s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1868.1799999999998s)]
*  He's like well he took the thing out of my hand. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1868.6599999999999s)]
*  Like you can't punch him in the back of the fucking head. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1870.34s)]
*  There's a limit. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1872.7s)]
*  You know you have to like talk them through emotions. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1873.26s)]
*  What I'm saying is that like encouraging aggression. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1876.1s)]
*  Yeah it's tough. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1879.4199999999998s)]
*  In defense of racism. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1879.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1881.7s)]
*  So you're trying to stop racism. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1881.98s)]
*  So to keep racism from happening you're going to encourage people to be [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1884.3s)]
*  aggressive. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1888.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1890.1000000000001s)]
*  Encourage people to yell like bad words and bad statements at people. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1890.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1895.7s)]
*  They just have to take it. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1896.14s)]
*  They haven't done anything wrong. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1896.9s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1898.02s)]
*  Wait. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1898.5800000000002s)]
*  That's not just devil's advocate. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1899.02s)]
*  You got to think these are trained educators. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1900.78s)]
*  So I mean they got some they got a thought of this. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=1903.1000000000001s)]

*  I'd be really bad. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2295.78s)]
*  Boss Rootin has the best podcast appearances on this podcast. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2296.46s)]
*  He was one of the very first guys that like was a high level striker that entered into any sort of mixed competition. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2299.94s)]
*  Like there was a few guys. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2306.62s)]
*  There was Orlando Viet who was in the early UFC's. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2307.78s)]

*  He was small. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2313.82s)]
*  He was like 180 pounds. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2314.9s)]

*  And so we all three of us go out in the hallway with Tate. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2547.1s)]
*  So it's me and Eddie Bravo and Tate and this big fucking guy and his two dopey friends. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2550.5s)]
*  And his two dopey friends don't know what to do. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2555.42s)]
*  And this guy's gigantic. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2556.98s)]
*  And he says something like I'll fuck you up and this and that. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2558.46s)]
*  I go dude. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2562.1s)]
*  I go you're making a fucking tremendous mistake here. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2563.34s)]
*  And we just step back. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2566.54s)]
*  And then he tries to get out of it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2568.22s)]
*  And then Eddie's like man you said you said you were going to do something. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2570.7s)]
*  Fucking do something. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2573.8199999999997s)]
*  Eddie literally causes the guy to come back out. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2575.3799999999997s)]
*  So this dumb guy comes back out and he literally steps to Tate like he's going to take a swing at him. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2579.2599999999998s)]
*  Tate grabs him pulls guard puts him in a plata. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2584.14s)]
*  Security guard shows up. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2588.54s)]
*  The security is like hey stop stop stop. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2590.14s)]
*  And he goes are you Joe Rogan. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2592.2999999999997s)]
*  I go yeah what's up. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2593.3799999999997s)]
*  How are you doing man. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2594.14s)]
*  I go don't worry. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2594.98s)]
*  I go he's not going to hurt him. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2596.2999999999997s)]
*  I go he's just going to strangle him unconscious and put him to sleep. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2598.22s)]
*  And so Tate goes well now I guess I have to put him to sleep. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2602.14s)]
*  So Tate transitions from an omaplata to a real naked choke with the omaplata. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2605.54s)]
*  So an omaplata is a shoulder lock and it's a shoulder lock where your arm is like really high up behind your back and the guy's legs are wrapped around it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2610.3399999999997s)]
*  So Tate is wrapped around like this and he has access to the guy's neck. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2617.54s)]
*  So he just grabs his neck and he puts him to sleep. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2620.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2623.18s)]
*  Puts him to sleep out cold. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2623.46s)]
*  The dude goes out. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2625.02s)]
*  His friends pick him up. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2626.22s)]
*  They drag him into an elevator and he just disappears from life. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2627.8199999999997s)]
*  Just gone. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2633.74s)]
*  That's not like the best version of an omaplata. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2634.46s)]
*  It's the best to see it like it's like that's you can see it right there. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2637.18s)]
*  But from what that position like Tate has his legs crossed like he's got a lot of weight on him and then he just strangles his neck. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2640.62s)]
*  So Tate leans forward. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2647.42s)]
*  So with the omaplata still in. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2648.8199999999997s)]
*  Tate was in Colorado. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2650.42s)]
*  Yes with the omaplata still in. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2650.98s)]
*  He let go of the omaplata to put him to sleep. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2652.58s)]
*  Tate was in Colorado at my Red Rocks show and we're hanging out partying late one night. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2654.5s)]
*  Tate's sober obviously. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2659.34s)]
*  And I said Tate can you tell that story? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2660.9s)]
*  So Leanne said everyone's around and he starts telling the story. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2664.54s)]
*  And he goes you know I listen to you tell it on Joe and there's some parts that are very interesting that you're not leaving into the story. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2666.78s)]
*  I said what? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2671.94s)]
*  I was practicing on my transition from omaplata to rear naked choke. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2674.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I was like oh I've been working on this. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2678.78s)]
*  It should be fun to work on a guy that has never done one. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2681.58s)]
*  He used to tackle it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2684.8199999999997s)]
*  So he's like oh cool I got it. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2685.62s)]
*  Dude to see Tate pull he was like I can't tackle this guy because there's a plate glass window behind him. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2687.54s)]
*  He goes we're near this elevator lobby area. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2692.34s)]
*  He goes I'm just going to pull guard. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2695.02s)]
*  Like he just fucking pulled guard. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2696.98s)]
*  He just got on his back and. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2697.98s)]
*  So he just grabbed the guy and pulled him on top of him. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2699.1s)]
*  And then immediately laced his leg over his arm and had this guy face forward fucked on the carpet. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2703.18s)]
*  At what point does guy go from I got him to wait what's he doing? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2708.6200000000003s)]
*  Well Tate never hurt him. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2712.6600000000003s)]
*  He never hurt him. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2713.78s)]
*  He never punched him. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2714.54s)]
*  He didn't beat him up. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2715.5s)]
*  He didn't do anything to him. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2716.38s)]
*  He just just put him to sleep. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2717.94s)]
*  And then they woke him up because all it does is you like shut off your it's like pinching a garden hose cuts off the water. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2719.86s)]
*  Brain brain goes out. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2726.02s)]
*  Let it go. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2727.3s)]
*  The guy's like what the fuck. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2727.82s)]
*  His friends just put him in the elevator. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2729.02s)]
*  Took him out and they apologized. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2730.7400000000002s)]
*  They're sorry my friends an asshole. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2732.02s)]
*  I'll go sorry brother. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2733.2200000000003s)]
*  Have a nice day. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2734.5s)]
*  Tate was the king to it at the old bomb squad of like if somebody went too hard during training and they're like threatening to injure people just like hey dude we're just rolling here we're just learning. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2735.02s)]

*  Tate is the guy they hire to be the scariest guy in the fucking movie. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2750.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2753.7s)]
*  When they're like yo we need to get to the point where we think that not Wesley Snipes who's look at Tate. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2754.06s)]
*  Bro this is a scene. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2763.7000000000003s)]

*  He's in that wild scene in the disco. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2767.54s)]
*  Yeah he gets killed. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2769.9s)]
*  But he's in that wild scene in the disco where all the Russian killers are coming after John Wick. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2770.9s)]
*  He's got to take them all out. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2775.54s)]
*  Look he's about to get stabbed right there. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2776.82s)]
*  He fights Denzel Washington in the whatchamacallit and he's the guy where they go clearly this is a guy that's going to kill the guy. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2778.14s)]

*  And he ends up dying. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2786.1800000000003s)]
*  Isn't it hilarious Hollywood where Denzel Washington can beat up Tate Fletcher. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2787.34s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2791.26s)]
*  It's funny that my daughter's met Tate. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2792.22s)]
*  Tate's girlfriend Lacey is my trainer and so she's a part of our family and my daughters love Lacey and Tate comes over and introduces himself and my daughters are mesmerized. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2794.34s)]

*  It's like odd shapes here. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2823.86s)]
*  It's underspoken how much like the work Tate does in movies as a fight guy like with. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2826.82s)]
*  We just saw the one with Denzel on the bus the other night. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2834.1s)]
*  How much work goes into that because it's I'm an ex-help. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2837.22s)]
*  It's the reason I had to get surgery. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2842.1s)]
*  It's like you can't just show up in a movie and be like I'm a fight guy. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2843.7s)]
*  You need to know what the fuck you're doing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2847.3s)]
*  Because you have to do extended stuff to look like you're fighting. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2849.3s)]
*  That's Keith Jardine too it looked like. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2851.62s)]

*  That movie was so brutal. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2862.98s)]
*  That was what got me through our Sober October competition. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2865.02s)]
*  I watched John Wick 50 times in a row once. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2868.78s)]
*  The day I did like seven hours on the elliptical machine. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2871.38s)]

*  Stallone just came out and said that his one of his big regrets. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2875.94s)]
*  He's like don't do your own stunts. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2879.5s)]

*  He got it. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2884.5s)]
*  Stallone has his neck fused from the expendables. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2884.9s)]
*  He was doing the expendables and he's like fucking 60. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=2887.82s)]

*  But I had a life. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=3135.62s)]
*  And then I started coming back and then they're all like hey so you fine? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=3136.3799999999997s)]

*  But how come the movie's not coming out yet? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4131.18s)]
*  Because Russia hasn't finished Ukraine off yet. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4133.14s)]

*  And people cheer when they do well. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4254.38s)]
*  Nobody gives a shit about Ukraine and Russia anymore. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4256.06s)]
*  They do. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4257.82s)]
*  But that's not the point is that we [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4258.38s)]
*  recognize in America that individual Russian citizens [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4260.54s)]

*  That's a great one. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4293.58s)]
*  Why'd you put it in your pocket? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4294.780000000001s)]
*  You're like, I don't know where to put it. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4296.02s)]

*  And you said, and you can find out [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4307.58s)]
*  who it was based on when we started filming. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4310.74s)]
*  And you said, no one goes hard as fuck on comedies anymore. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4313.22s)]
*  No one's making real comedies. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4316.98s)]
*  And I sat up in bed in Serbia and I went, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4318.5s)]
*  I'm going hard as fuck. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4321.82s)]

*  I rewrote, I went through and I rewrote some stuff, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4325.66s)]
*  ran it by Peter Atencio. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4328.66s)]
*  He was like, well, shoot it. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4330.179999999999s)]

*  Why not make a movie with that shit? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4339.9s)]
*  It can be done. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4341.62s)]
*  There's the same reason why there's an audience [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4342.62s)]
*  for our kind of comedy. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4345.7s)]
*  The same reason why Shane Gillis is killing it right now. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4347.379999999999s)]

*  You won't get sued for $30 million. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4400.46s)]
*  Is it advantageous for you to release it as a streamer [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4401.7s)]
*  or in theaters? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4404.82s)]

*  It's a better joyous experience to be in a theater [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4410.58s)]
*  with a bunch of people. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4412.78s)]
*  Comedy especially. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4413.62s)]
*  Yeah, comedy especially. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4414.46s)]
*  Laughing with people. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4415.28s)]
*  We watched it in the theaters for the screeners. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4416.12s)]
*  And when you fucking see people [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4417.78s)]

*  Fall out of their fucking seats. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4420.98s)]
*  Especially that scene. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4422.219999999999s)]
*  That scene. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4423.82s)]
*  People are crying. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4424.86s)]
*  I remember still, cause I haven't, it's been a while, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4426.34s)]
*  I remember going to opening night of the first Borat [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4428.22s)]
*  and like it was packed. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4431.54s)]
*  And that experience was so fun. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4433.14s)]
*  It was so fun. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4435.42s)]
*  People were dying in that theater. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4436.34s)]
*  First Borat was so good. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4438.42s)]
*  God damn man. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4440.26s)]
*  We were just like. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4441.1s)]
*  God damn that was good. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4441.9400000000005s)]
*  But it was about being in a packed theater. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4442.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4444.780000000001s)]
*  Opening week of a comedy is the best. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4445.62s)]
*  And here's where movies, I'm not, look, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4447.58s)]
*  I won't shit on anyone who made any movie. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4450.02s)]
*  Once you make a movie, you realize how hard it is. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4452.160000000001s)]
*  But the thing people sometimes forget [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4454.12s)]
*  is that comedy is about not expecting [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4458.52s)]
*  the thing you're about to see. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4461.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4463.04s)]
*  Surprise. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4463.88s)]
*  And it's about surprise. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4464.72s)]
*  And having people take chances. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4465.54s)]
*  When we shot that first day shooting, we shot, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4467.4800000000005s)]
*  and look, I was gonna apologize to everyone, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4471.08s)]
*  but like Mary Josh, who were back in LA, wrote back, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4472.96s)]
*  you couldn't go harder. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4478.16s)]
*  Like go harder. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4479.88s)]
*  Like, and that energy to make a comedy these days [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4481.04s)]
*  is where you have to be. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4483.96s)]
*  You've gotta say shit. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4485.2s)]
*  You've gotta go as hard as you wanna go to make a comedy. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4486.16s)]
*  Think about all the ones we love. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4488.92s)]
*  Tropic Thunder. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4490.32s)]
*  That's all we, dude. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4491.2s)]
*  Went harder than Tropic Thunder. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4492.24s)]
*  Thank you, Joe. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4493.5599999999995s)]

*  That's the movie. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4496.0599999999995s)]
*  Happy Gilmore. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4496.9s)]
*  I can't wait till you see Fat Astronauts, Joe. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4497.74s)]
*  But Tropic Thunder's so over the top. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4499.32s)]
*  Did you like Tropic Thunder? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4502.32s)]

*  Eton, what's up? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4510.139999999999s)]

*  We were in Serbia, right? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4518.64s)]
*  The Farreles are the best. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4519.48s)]
*  We're in Serbia. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4520.32s)]
*  And I know that there's a lot of people [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4521.14s)]
*  that'll be upset over Legendary when I say, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4521.98s)]
*  share all this, but like we're in Serbia. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4523.4s)]
*  We're trying to close the deal to do Fat Astronauts, right? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4524.96s)]
*  And we're talking, we're going back and forth. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4528.28s)]
*  And then Cale, my guy, you met him. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4530.04s)]
*  You met him at the Four Seasons. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4532.8s)]
*  We had cigars together. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4533.96s)]
*  Cale's the guy from Legendary. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4535.36s)]
*  Cale comes over and he goes, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4536.44s)]

*  Let's close the deal. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4549.68s)]
*  Let's get Eton. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4550.5s)]
*  Let's just do this fucking movie hard. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4551.34s)]
*  And I was like, done. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4552.84s)]
*  Done. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4554.72s)]
*  And we've been working with Eton now [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4556.48s)]
*  on this movie, Fat Astronauts for a while now, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4558.04s)]
*  but it's like the whole thing. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4561.4s)]
*  And I would never give away any plots we're working on. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4562.76s)]
*  But the thing is, is like, go fucking hard. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4565.78s)]
*  It's the shit that makes us laugh. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4569.12s)]
*  There's not a lot of people that do it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4570.84s)]
*  That's why it stands out. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4571.96s)]
*  You know? [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4573.12s)]
*  But they did it forever. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4573.96s)]
*  And then everybody just backed off. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4575.4400000000005s)]
*  The studios got scared. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4576.360000000001s)]
*  They got scared of making big comedies. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4577.56s)]
*  Well, they got scared of the... [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4579.8s)]
*  The social media aspect, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4581.64s)]
*  the thing that social media's done, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4583.08s)]
*  is giving everybody a voice. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4584.56s)]
*  But the problem with that is like... [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4586.320000000001s)]
*  But they don't care about it. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4587.16s)]
*  They're weighing on shit they don't care about. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4588.0s)]
*  But the problem is, it could be a small number of people [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4588.84s)]
*  that most people disagree with, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4592.74s)]
*  but they get enough momentum. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4594.96s)]
*  People decide that if you don't support [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4596.64s)]
*  the things that they support, you're a piece of shit. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4598.6s)]
*  Yeah. It's crazy. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4601.28s)]
*  And you're worried about that reprisal, it gets dangerous. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4602.12s)]
*  In the old days, we all dealt with this. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4605.08s)]
*  There was a like, oh, you're dirty? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4606.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you have to be dirty? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4608.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4609.32s)]
*  And so then it was like, it was about taste. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4610.16s)]
*  And then they became, well, if you don't do what we do, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4612.16s)]
*  you're morally bereft. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4614.74s)]
*  Instead of just like, you're not the style we like. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4617.08s)]
*  There's so many notes that was given about that. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4619.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4621.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4621.839999999999s)]
*  People would go, you know, you'd do a lot better [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4622.66s)]
*  if you weren't so dirty up there. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4624.799999999999s)]
*  Dude, that was my whole fucking, the beginning of my career. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4626.28s)]
*  My manager wanted me to be clean. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4628.719999999999s)]
*  Same thing, man. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4630.48s)]
*  I had managers tell me, club owners, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4631.48s)]
*  have you heard the story of how my manager [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4633.76s)]
*  changed his opinion? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4635.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4636.580000000001s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4637.42s)]
*  So I did mostly like shitty dives in Boston. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4638.240000000001s)]
*  It was hard for me to get booked in the city [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4641.56s)]
*  because I was dirty. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4643.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4644.52s)]
*  But they would give me like open mic sets, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4645.360000000001s)]
*  they'd give me guest spots, they were trying to groom me. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4649.6s)]
*  Right, it was a very good system, right? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4651.4800000000005s)]
*  It was a system that was fucked up [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4653.88s)]
*  because it was acting on a faulty premise. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4655.320000000001s)]
*  And that premise was you had to be clean [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4658.04s)]
*  in order to have a real career. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4659.72s)]
*  Because you had to get to the night show. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4660.84s)]
*  Yeah, because you had to do the tonight show [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4662.24s)]
*  and you wanted to get a sitcom. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4664.0s)]
*  It wasn't artistically the right way to operate, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4665.28s)]
*  but they were operating on, honestly, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4669.16s)]
*  a sound business model. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4670.88s)]
*  This is what works. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4672.28s)]
*  Yes, because if you could be that guy [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4673.12s)]
*  who became Jerry Seinfeld or Roseanne Barr, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4674.56s)]
*  if you could get your sitcom, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4676.400000000001s)]
*  you are the fucking king of the world. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4677.72s)]
*  And that's what everybody wanted, right? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4679.72s)]
*  So they had this system that was set up, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4681.400000000001s)]
*  like you just had to be clean in order to get up in clubs. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4683.4400000000005s)]
*  I got lucky. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4686.76s)]
*  When I went to do a guest spot, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4688.24s)]
*  I was driving limos and I called up Bill, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4691.0s)]
*  who was the guy who was the owner of the club. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4694.12s)]
*  And I said, hey, could I get, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4696.96s)]
*  I think I called him or I might've called the guy [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4698.6s)]
*  who was the manager. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4700.24s)]
*  But I said, can I get 10 minutes? [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4701.08s)]
*  I have a new bit I just wrote today [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4702.6s)]
*  that I wanna see if it works. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4705.32s)]
*  Like, I'm real excited about it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4706.72s)]
*  He goes, yeah, for sure. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4708.28s)]
*  So he gives me a spot. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4709.48s)]
*  And I had no idea anybody was there. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4711.08s)]
*  And my manager was there. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4713.24s)]
*  We wound up being my manager. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4714.48s)]
*  He was in the back of the room. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4716.24s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4717.56s)]
*  So you weren't working with him yet? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4718.76s)]
*  Not yet. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4720.2s)]
*  Kill, kill. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4721.04s)]
*  Like, so loose, so relaxed. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4722.32s)]
*  Have a great set. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm only three years in the comedy, I'm terrible. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4725.36s)]
*  But every now and then I have a good set. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4727.16s)]
*  So I had this great set. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4729.04s)]
*  And then he takes me to New York. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4730.24s)]
*  I do Catch a Rising Star. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4731.44s)]
*  I do all these different places he wants to see me at. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4732.76s)]
*  And then he takes me to Fast Eddie's. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4734.8s)]
*  It was a bar in Huntington, Long Island. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4736.4s)]
*  It was a fucking dive. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4738.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a dude on stage named Eddie Gallo [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4740.28s)]
*  and he was doing a reverse shit with a banana. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4742.5599999999995s)]
*  So he takes a banana and like sucks it into his mouth [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4745.16s)]
*  like the opposite way. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4747.599999999999s)]
*  So like the point comes out at the, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4748.88s)]
*  he starts it with the point. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4752.08s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4753.12s)]
*  But it's hilarious. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4754.12s)]
*  It's bar comedy. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4755.4400000000005s)]
*  So my manager says, listen, I'm gonna get you out of this. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4757.4400000000005s)]
*  You don't have to do this. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4759.16s)]
*  I go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4760.08s)]
*  I go, these are my people. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4762.08s)]
*  I go, just sit down. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4763.8s)]
*  I go, let me just, let me do a set here. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4765.400000000001s)]
*  Let me do a set here. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4767.6s)]
*  And I go, I'm just blow job jokes and doggy style [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4768.4400000000005s)]
*  and people sucking your dick [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4772.52s)]
*  while they're looking you in the eye. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4774.24s)]
*  Like the windows to the soul. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4775.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like crazy, like wild bar sex comedy. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4776.84s)]
*  And then he goes, okay, forget everything I said. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4781.12s)]
*  No more clean. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4783.72s)]
*  He goes, you gotta go off. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4784.76s)]
*  Just go for it. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4785.76s)]
*  It's gonna be a harder road, but just gotta be you. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4786.6s)]
*  Whatever you saw right there, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4789.0s)]
*  at least that's you loose and free. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4789.84s)]
*  And I crushed in this terrible bar. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4792.12s)]
*  But it was like, for me, it was like, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4794.68s)]
*  this is what I've been doing. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4796.16s)]
*  Thank God he didn't have like too much of an ego [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4797.400000000001s)]
*  to not say that. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4799.72s)]
*  Because there's a ton of guys who've been like, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4800.56s)]
*  listen, man, I know that works, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4801.72s)]
*  but you gotta stop doing it. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4802.84s)]
*  There were a lot of people that did say that though. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4804.68s)]
*  Of course. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4806.8s)]
*  There's a lot of people that said that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4807.639999999999s)]
*  Back in those days, they were right though. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4808.48s)]
*  If you looked at it from a utilitarian point of view, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4811.0s)]
*  they didn't know the internet was gonna be a thing. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4814.24s)]
*  They didn't know that you could actually make a career [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4816.28s)]
*  completely detached. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4819.2s)]
*  You got to do it instead. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4820.5199999999995s)]
*  Just pre-internet though. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4821.36s)]
*  You know, it's funny is like. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4822.2s)]
*  If killing it, you can't deny it. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4823.04s)]
*  Anybody can be a, like, can call themselves a manager. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4824.08s)]
*  And I was working in post-production. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4827.44s)]
*  I was the lead logger on a post-reality show. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4829.12s)]
*  So they send you the raw footage and you got that type. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4832.5599999999995s)]
*  So I'm in charge of the department. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4834.48s)]
*  And one of the loggers is a comedy manager. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4836.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is, I mean, that's how crazy it is. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4841.24s)]
*  And one day she comes up to me and she was like, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4843.759999999999s)]
*  hey, I watched your set. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4846.32s)]
*  And I just wanted to say, you know, you're funny, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=4849.799999999999s)]

*  You ever like talk to a bunch of comics [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5098.84s)]
*  for like a weekend or something, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5100.2s)]
*  and then you go to your norm core people. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5101.52s)]
*  It's the worst. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5103.0s)]
*  And you bring a comic joke. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5103.84s)]
*  It makes you go like, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5105.12s)]
*  I don't wanna hang out with anybody that's not a comedian. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5105.9400000000005s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, say that again. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5107.72s)]
*  What? I missed it. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5109.04s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5109.88s)]
*  You hang out with normal people, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5110.72s)]
*  but you bring comedy sensibility. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5111.54s)]
*  You just came out from Norman's bachelor party or something. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5113.04s)]
*  And they go like, oh my God. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5114.92s)]
*  Or there's one comic and there are like two other people. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5116.56s)]
*  And you're saying inappropriate shit, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5119.6s)]
*  and everyone's like, oh! [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5120.96s)]
*  And like, I thought that's what we were doing. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5122.52s)]
*  I thought, yeah. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5124.12s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5124.96s)]
*  We're all together drinking. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5125.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not used to it. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5126.64s)]
*  Do you remember the thing that made me laugh so hard? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5127.4800000000005s)]
*  And I won't get too into details [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5130.16s)]
*  that would probably upset people, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5132.08s)]
*  but yerking off. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5133.24s)]
*  And I could not stop laughing. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5136.24s)]
*  What is that? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5138.72s)]
*  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5139.56s)]
*  What is that? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5140.4s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5141.24s)]
*  I'm not gonna remember this. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5142.56s)]
*  We do a ski festival. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5143.68s)]
*  And I could not stop laughing. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5145.28s)]
*  And I tried to show it to regular people. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5147.2s)]
*  And they don't get it. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5149.52s)]
*  And because of the energy of the thing, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5150.36s)]
*  they couldn't disconnect from the energy. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5153.12s)]
*  And we were crying. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5155.44s)]
*  We were having a blast. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5156.76s)]
*  Bird had just bought, we do these ski festivals, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5157.88s)]
*  these mini festivals we do. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5161.28s)]
*  Just six, seven, eight comics, skiing. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5162.68s)]
*  We do a couple shows to pay for it. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5164.64s)]
*  And then we just go skiing. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5166.04s)]
*  And we're all hanging out in a cabin. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5168.24s)]
*  And we're watching the angry response. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5170.36s)]
*  Oh fuck, we're telling it. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5173.599999999999s)]
*  To Louis CK's Parkland joke. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5175.04s)]
*  Parkland joke. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5178.599999999999s)]
*  Parkland joke from the parents. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5179.44s)]
*  Oh, get out there. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5181.36s)]
*  He goes, he does, the dad. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5183.16s)]
*  It's all comics. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5186.48s)]
*  It's all comics. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5187.72s)]
*  And by the way, I'm a regular person also. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5188.6s)]
*  So I can empathize with everything the father feels. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5192.0s)]
*  But he was trying to slam Louis. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5194.92s)]
*  And in the process of it, the way of him saying [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5197.44s)]
*  that he was, you know, he was quite jerking off. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5200.92s)]
*  It was so comedic that he did not intend it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5203.64s)]
*  And I saw it and I couldn't stop laughing. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5206.76s)]
*  And they're like, what are you laughing at? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5209.08s)]
*  I go, you guys have to see it. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5210.12s)]
*  And I want to see if you laugh as hard as I laugh. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5210.96s)]
*  And it's just kind of a video. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5213.2s)]
*  The guy who posted it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5214.96s)]
*  Oh, we can watch it right now? [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5216.6s)]
*  You can watch it right now. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5218.08s)]
*  Should we not watch it? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5218.92s)]
*  Because you don't want this guy to. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5219.76s)]
*  I would not, I would not, I would not. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5220.6s)]
*  He doesn't have a censor. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5223.2s)]
*  But the guy's clearly like a Cuban or a Puerto Rican guy. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5224.08s)]
*  And he's like, he's like, I mean, he always is like. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5227.92s)]
*  And this one comedian who was jerking off. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5231.96s)]
*  And the way he says it is so funny [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5236.32s)]
*  that it was not his intent. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5239.04s)]
*  But it made us laugh so hard. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5240.679999999999s)]
*  And we're trying to listen to his message. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5242.12s)]
*  His message is like. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5244.0s)]
*  Jerking off. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5245.2s)]
*  It was what for a fan of comedy, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5246.639999999999s)]
*  it was the perfect amount of seriousness. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5250.0s)]
*  The whole week, everyone's like, what are you doing? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5252.08s)]

*  And we're all just dying. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5255.44s)]
*  And he did not mean to be funny. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5256.28s)]
*  And that's when things are the funniest for a comic. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5257.4s)]
*  And we were crying laughing. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5259.44s)]

*  Why? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5452.740000000001s)]
*  If you're Garth's manager. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5453.56s)]
*  I'll tell you as Garth, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5454.400000000001s)]
*  how many months do you think it happened to Garth [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5459.14s)]
*  where it was a problem? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5461.4800000000005s)]
*  Where he was like, the fuck is this? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5462.860000000001s)]
*  Never. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5464.7s)]
*  All of the months. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5465.7s)]
*  It's just, actually. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5466.54s)]
*  We got, so we got, at first we would go like, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5468.46s)]
*  do you think Garth knows? [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5470.54s)]
*  And we'd talk about that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5472.02s)]
*  And then I happened to meet somebody [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5472.9s)]
*  who actually is closely connected to him. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5477.139999999999s)]
*  And happens to be a fan of mine. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5480.78s)]
*  And I met this person and I go, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5484.219999999999s)]
*  so what's going on? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5486.62s)]
*  Like, does he know? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5487.82s)]
*  And he goes, oh yeah, he knows. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5488.66s)]
*  Of course he knows. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5489.9s)]
*  And then I go, so what's the deal? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5490.74s)]
*  And they go, well, he goes, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5491.839999999999s)]
*  I asked his right hand person, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5493.7s)]
*  does Garth hate Tom? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5498.099999999999s)]
*  The guy goes, Garth doesn't hate anybody. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5500.38s)]
*  Which is such a Garth answer. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5503.46s)]
*  Garth doesn't hate anybody. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5505.9400000000005s)]
*  Because you would say no. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5506.900000000001s)]
*  Right, but what is it? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5508.26s)]
*  Just that they're just accept that it's, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5510.18s)]
*  they have a spin on it. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5513.12s)]
*  That they're like, you know, when you're big, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5514.3s)]
*  when you're really well known, you have a big profile. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5515.9800000000005s)]
*  You can't control what happens online and all this stuff. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5518.14s)]
*  But it's all the comments. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5520.62s)]
*  It's not like 10. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5522.22s)]
*  It's every post. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5523.1s)]
*  It's every post. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5524.3s)]
*  But if he went on your podcast, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5525.360000000001s)]
*  I think it would turn around. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5528.2s)]
*  For Tom, for Tom. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5530.900000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5531.740000000001s)]
*  For Garth. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5532.56s)]
*  No, he's right. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5533.400000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5534.22s)]
*  Hang on, hang on. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5535.06s)]
*  I'm gonna be, you guys are all. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5535.900000000001s)]
*  Why can't you let him talk for a second? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5536.740000000001s)]
*  Because. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5537.580000000001s)]
*  No, it's his turn. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5538.42s)]
*  It's Bert's turn. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5539.240000000001s)]
*  Are you sure? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5540.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5540.92s)]
*  If you shut him up, now it's your turn. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5541.740000000001s)]
*  He shuts him up and then you'll shut me up. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5542.580000000001s)]
*  Nothing benefits Garth in this. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5543.900000000001s)]
*  But he talked over him while he was talking. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5545.700000000001s)]
*  There's nothing that benefits Garth. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5546.54s)]
*  I'm just being real. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5548.22s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5549.06s)]
*  It benefits Tom. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5549.900000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you why. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5550.740000000001s)]
*  It's bigger for Tom than it is for Garth. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5551.580000000001s)]
*  Garth doesn't get a fam. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5553.22s)]
*  Here's why I disagree. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5554.34s)]
*  Here's why I disagree. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5555.3s)]
*  So we have profiled people that we've made fun of before [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5556.5s)]
*  and there's a handful of them that leaned into it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5560.900000000001s)]
*  Like they were, a dude's dating video [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5564.38s)]
*  that we profile and we make fun of [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5567.06s)]
*  and then he's like, hey, I'm the guy. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5568.620000000001s)]
*  And everybody who's making fun of them goes, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5571.5s)]
*  oh, like. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5573.820000000001s)]
*  He's cool. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5574.740000000001s)]
*  You're owning that you made this terrible dating video [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5575.580000000001s)]
*  and then it becomes like basically, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5578.72s)]
*  they become all fans of this guy. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5580.360000000001s)]
*  And I think if he were to show the sense of humor. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5582.5s)]
*  What did I ever do to y'all? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5586.06s)]
*  I think it would actually, people would flip out. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5588.58s)]
*  Objection. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5590.9s)]
*  You're talking about, I'm just being, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5591.74s)]
*  yes, yes, go ahead. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5593.1s)]
*  You know, I'm your best friend. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5593.94s)]
*  I'm not disagreeing. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5594.78s)]
*  Just go ahead. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5596.1s)]
*  You're talking about the guy's dating video [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5597.74s)]
*  versus Garth Brooks. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5600.54s)]
*  Who's selling out stadiums. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5602.54s)]
*  He already has the fans. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5603.9s)]
*  I know he does. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5605.06s)]
*  But it's like Wayne Brady leaning into like, I'm a gangster. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5605.9s)]
*  Nope, it's not. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5608.72s)]
*  It's not. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5610.42s)]
*  No. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5611.38s)]
*  You're talking about a guy who in all respects [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5613.06s)]
*  is kind of trolling a star. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5618.14s)]
*  It's like if I, you know. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5620.820000000001s)]
*  I'm just being honest about it. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5622.7s)]
*  It's because there are too many of them. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5624.5s)]
*  I know, but I think what actually happens, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5625.34s)]
*  this is my just opinion. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5628.22s)]
*  I think it would actually. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5629.54s)]
*  Super sensitive bird over here. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5630.38s)]
*  I think what the fuck's going on? [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5631.2s)]
*  I've thought about this before. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5632.04s)]
*  But look, I've thought about this a ton. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5633.14s)]
*  Oh, Burr Brooks over here. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5634.58s)]
*  I think it would make Garth Brooks more money [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5635.42s)]
*  to be on my podcast. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5637.46s)]
*  Burr Brooks. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5638.66s)]
*  Oh, you son of a bitch. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5639.5s)]
*  No, no, no, be serious though. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5640.34s)]
*  You son of a bitch. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5641.34s)]
*  But like, Garth's already got the fans [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5642.18s)]
*  and his fans aren't your mom's house fans. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5643.860000000001s)]
*  The comments change. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5646.46s)]
*  I think what happens is he starts getting a bunch of, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5647.46s)]
*  instead of like these things that make no sense, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5650.06s)]
*  they all start going like love, love, love. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5652.42s)]
*  If he doesn't like the comments, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5653.9800000000005s)]
*  the comments go away because of this. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5655.18s)]
*  I do, I think so. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5656.58s)]
*  But as a person who's been a victim of Tom's comments. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5657.46s)]
*  Because you fuck dogs. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5662.46s)]
*  Or the worst one. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5663.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the worst one. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5665.54s)]
*  George Stone even. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5666.38s)]
*  Was when my special came out, Secret Time, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5667.22s)]
*  and Tom was calling me the biggest American racist [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5671.34s)]
*  in the world. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5673.82s)]
*  And I was watching it happen in the comments. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5674.98s)]
*  And it was like, I wish I could watch this, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5677.7s)]
*  but he's a racist. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5680.74s)]
*  And then to watch the confusion that happens. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5681.94s)]
*  That's the problem is the confusion that happens [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5684.34s)]
*  is what makes you feel powerless, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5686.74s)]
*  is when someone's trolling you. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5689.0199999999995s)]
*  But that's happening now. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5691.0199999999995s)]
*  But the confusion is where Garth's fans are, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5692.259999999999s)]
*  I'll be real, are not the smartest dudes in the world. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5695.66s)]
*  Don't say that. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5698.9s)]
*  Because a lot of nice people and smart people [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5700.099999999999s)]
*  are Garth's fans. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5701.86s)]
*  But if they're in the comments, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5702.98s)]
*  and they see all this craziness, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5704.98s)]
*  that they don't understand at all, [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5706.5s)]
*  and it's all where the body's at. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5708.179999999999s)]
*  They don't understand it because where the body is at all. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5709.0199999999995s)]
*  He ain't killed nobody. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5711.26s)]
*  But if he does kill a man, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5713.54s)]
*  this is how my comments work. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5715.179999999999s)]
*  Then he killed a man because they deserved it, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5716.78s)]
*  and it's okay to kill a black. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5719.139999999999s)]
*  That's the way these comments are coming out. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5721.38s)]
*  Where the fuck? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5723.78s)]
*  Because I watched, I watched it happen to me. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5725.3s)]
*  They might not even be real comments. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5727.58s)]
*  They might be Russian troll farms. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5728.94s)]
*  They're commenting. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5730.0599999999995s)]
*  They, the best was actually at that concert [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5730.98s)]
*  that Zolo went to and held up that sign. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5733.54s)]
*  They interviewed people outside the concert, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5735.7s)]
*  and they were like, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5738.66s)]
*  what do you think of these accusations? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5739.5s)]
*  And now it was on one of the live shows, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5741.339999999999s)]
*  but it had all these people go like, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5745.0199999999995s)]
*  some people were like, what are you talking about? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5747.379999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5749.0599999999995s)]
*  And then some of them were like, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5750.0199999999995s)]
*  well, I'm a fan of the music. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5750.94s)]
*  If he kills somebody, he kills somebody. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5752.86s)]
*  They just roll with it. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5754.7s)]
*  Did you hear he killed someone? [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5755.54s)]
*  Like, oh man, I don't know. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5756.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5758.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5759.3s)]
*  Why are you bothering me with that? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5760.14s)]
*  You know, I'm. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5760.9800000000005s)]
*  It does not, there's not one person in Garth's team [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5761.820000000001s)]
*  that is of sound mind that would go like, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5764.62s)]
*  you should definitely go on your mom's house. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5766.26s)]
*  Disagree. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5767.780000000001s)]
*  If he doesn't like the comments, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5768.62s)]
*  they go away with that. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5769.58s)]
*  Listen, Garth, I'm a fan. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5770.42s)]
*  I would have never done what Tom's done, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5772.26s)]
*  but I need you to know that it's gonna be okay. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5774.1s)]
*  And if you go on your mom's house, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5776.9400000000005s)]
*  we'll clear everything up. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5778.38s)]
*  Dude, I'll follow up. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5779.54s)]
*  No one's lower than Tom Segura. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5781.46s)]
*  And if you have friends in low places. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5783.3s)]
*  I remember I was in a fucking bar in Ohio. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5785.86s)]
*  I did a college in Ohio. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5789.259999999999s)]
*  And these kids from the college, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5791.179999999999s)]
*  I was like 23 or 24, something like that. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5793.219999999999s)]
*  And these kids from the college were like 20. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5796.099999999999s)]
*  They took me out to some place. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5797.62s)]
*  And we all went to this honky tonk type bar. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5799.139999999999s)]
*  And that song came on. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5801.86s)]
*  And I had a drink and I was like, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5803.0599999999995s)]
*  this is the greatest song in the world. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5804.259999999999s)]
*  Ah, I have friends. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5805.66s)]
*  It's a great catchy song. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5806.5s)]
*  Garth Brooks. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5808.42s)]
*  And people were singing along, dude. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5809.259999999999s)]
*  People were singing along. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5810.54s)]
*  We were all drinking whiskey. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5811.86s)]
*  No doubt he rules. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5812.94s)]
*  I'll tell you where he, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5813.78s)]
*  I'll tell you, can I, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5814.62s)]

*  He had his own Amazon deal. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5862.9400000000005s)]
*  So when everybody was on, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5864.700000000001s)]
*  like when Apple Music just exploded and iTunes and stuff, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5866.22s)]

*  He made a deal with Amazon Music. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5870.580000000001s)]
*  So yeah, that's really what lifted up that whole platform [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5872.26s)]
*  was Amazon Music. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5875.38s)]
*  Then he would do discographies and be like, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5876.5s)]
*  no, you can only get it at Walmart [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5878.46s)]
*  because they keep their prices low [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5880.3s)]
*  and that's where my fans wanna go. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5881.740000000001s)]

*  Man, that guy is like selling out [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5889.14s)]

*  Totally. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5893.18s)]
*  I mean, you compare that to a couple murders. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5894.02s)]
*  What does it really matter? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5896.7s)]
*  This is just teasing [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5899.3s)]
*  and they really shouldn't at this point. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5900.46s)]

*  What do you mean? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5996.14s)]
*  That's the problem with you is that once you plant the seed, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5996.98s)]
*  then you walk away like a farmer [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=5999.26s)]

*  to see it in your comments and go, [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6019.18s)]
*  and tell your team, please don't fuck with it. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6021.7s)]
*  Let it happen. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6023.820000000001s)]

*  yeah, but it's not cool what he does to dogs. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6034.46s)]
*  And they're like, wait, I'm a big animal activist. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6036.38s)]
*  What happens? [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6038.22s)]

*  Some of my favorite times of the year. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6128.72s)]
*  We took a few years off too, right? [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6130.48s)]

*  And we came back strong, this one. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6139.04s)]
*  And we came back in this one where, you know, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6141.32s)]
*  we had a thing that we had to do again, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6144.08s)]
*  which I think is the best thing. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6146.08s)]

*  I was against it not competing [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6151.32s)]
*  because I was like, you gotta have a goal or a winner, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6152.639999999999s)]
*  but I was wrong. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6155.759999999999s)]
*  A challenge is good. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6156.599999999999s)]

*  The problem with winners and losers is I'm crazy. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6163.5199999999995s)]

*  Are they Marky Mark pushups? [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6257.92s)]
*  It's being questioned whether it's even possible. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6259.24s)]
*  That's not a person in a row. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6261.04s)]
*  Oh, if we do Marky Mark pushups, I can fuck shit up. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6261.88s)]
*  Your Marky Mark pushup is just getting your head down. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6265.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's Marky Mark pushups. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6268.08s)]
*  You're gonna make me Tara Peck. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6268.92s)]
*  I'm Tara Peck. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6270.28s)]
*  Tara Peck. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6271.12s)]
*  Tara Peck. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6271.96s)]
*  I'm gonna go crazy, and I'm not gonna wanna lose to you [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6272.8s)]
*  ever in anything. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6275.2s)]
*  The problem is, here's the way it works with competition. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6276.28s)]
*  So it's entirely mental. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6281.44s)]
*  Oh, you think? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6284.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's entirely mental. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6284.84s)]
*  How many is this guy doing? [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6286.0s)]
*  Just doing 30 seconds. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6286.84s)]
*  He did 50 in 30 seconds. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6287.66s)]
*  He did 50 in 30 seconds. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6288.5s)]
*  That's pretty fucking good. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6289.34s)]
*  Good body on that guy. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6290.179999999999s)]
*  He's jacked. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6291.24s)]
*  Good body, good beard. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6292.08s)]
*  Nice tits. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6292.9s)]
*  Nice hat. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6293.74s)]
*  Solid shoes. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6295.04s)]
*  I did 40 the other day in a row. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6296.08s)]
*  He is moving, dude. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6298.4s)]
*  Yeah, those are fast. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6299.24s)]
*  He's going fast. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6300.08s)]
*  Well, that's how I do them explosive. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6300.92s)]
*  You're not supposed to touch your chest to the ground? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6303.8s)]
*  You can, you can. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6307.12s)]
*  I do whatever. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6307.96s)]
*  I always click. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6308.78s)]
*  I make sure my neck lifts. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6309.92s)]
*  I wanna hear a click from the chest trap. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6310.76s)]
*  That's a better push-up. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6312.92s)]
*  That's how I do a push-up. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6313.76s)]
*  The chest trap gets down there. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6314.58s)]
*  I go to the click. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6315.42s)]
*  Yeah, when the chest trap clicks, I go up. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6316.26s)]
*  Either chest trap or the tip of my nose. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6318.08s)]
*  I think you could probably do a few more than 40. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6319.5199999999995s)]
*  I probably could do 50. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6321.48s)]
*  I could definitely do more than that. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6323.04s)]
*  Can I just say, this is a time. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6323.88s)]
*  You could do 100 in a row. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6324.72s)]
*  I don't know what I could do, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6326.599999999999s)]
*  but I would 100% be able to do 50 easy. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6327.44s)]
*  Yeah, I know you could. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6329.72s)]
*  But that's a big back-off from I can double you. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6330.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I definitely can't double him. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6333.12s)]
*  I should've said that. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6334.12s)]
*  When I said that, I was like, ooh. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6334.96s)]
*  That could be a problem. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6337.0s)]
*  Oh, Joey backtracks. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6337.84s)]
*  Joey backtracks is taking it back right now [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6339.12s)]
*  because if he can do 50, [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6341.4s)]
*  I don't think I can do 100 in a row. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6343.04s)]
*  He can't do 50. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6344.12s)]
*  I can do 50. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6344.96s)]
*  That fat piece of lard. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6345.8s)]
*  He might be able to pull out 50 [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6346.64s)]
*  and completely herniated disc. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6348.32s)]
*  I don't think you can do 40. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6350.76s)]
*  I just did 40 online the other day. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6351.599999999999s)]
*  You said you did, but there's no proof of it. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6353.16s)]
*  Yeah, I videotaped it. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6355.16s)]
*  You could probably do 28. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6356.48s)]
*  Well, we were waiting to see Roger Waters. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6358.0s)]
*  I saw Ari do 10 girl push-ups. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6360.16s)]
*  That's good. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6362.92s)]
*  Dude, I started at four. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6364.6s)]
*  The way? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6366.12s)]
*  With my max out. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6366.96s)]
*  Joe's like, I get it. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6367.8s)]
*  Just do 10 at a time. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6368.64s)]
*  What can you do right now? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6369.4800000000005s)]
*  My record. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6370.64s)]
*  Let's blow it out right now. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6371.68s)]
*  I could do 10. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6372.76s)]
*  Nope. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6373.6s)]
*  You could say as many as you can do. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6374.4400000000005s)]
*  10? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6375.92s)]
*  I could do 10. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6376.76s)]
*  I could probably get up to 14. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6377.6s)]
*  I got up to 14 from four to 14. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6378.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, that's good improvement. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6380.52s)]
*  In a row. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6381.76s)]
*  That's really good. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6382.6s)]
*  That's a big improvement. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6383.68s)]
*  Triple. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6384.64s)]
*  Oh, four to 14. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6385.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6386.68s)]
*  Okay. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6387.52s)]
*  I'm not listening. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6388.72s)]
*  So wait. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6390.64s)]
*  When you guys did your push-ups, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6392.32s)]
*  because I would do them, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6393.839999999999s)]
*  because I was afraid about tearing a pack, no joke, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6394.679999999999s)]
*  I would do 10 sets of 10. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6397.16s)]
*  Yeah, I was doing five sets of 20. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6400.36s)]
*  You have to be careful. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6402.04s)]
*  But the other thing is like, [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6403.4s)]
*  you can do more work if you give yourself more rest. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6404.36s)]
*  That's that whole Pavel Tatsulin method of strength. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6407.4s)]
*  He says strength is a skill. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6411.28s)]
*  And if you do strength stuff, [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6413.0s)]
*  like to the point where you're shaking, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6414.48s)]
*  and you're not gonna do it the same way you would do it [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6416.24s)]
*  if you were fresh. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6417.919999999999s)]
*  Don't you tear most of them back up that way though? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6418.759999999999s)]
*  No, that's not what he thinks. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6419.599999999999s)]
*  And this is very controversial, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6421.8s)]
*  and a lot of people disagree. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6422.92s)]
*  But one thing that I think is valid about it [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6424.12s)]
*  is that you don't get hurt as much. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6428.5599999999995s)]
*  Because instead of doing one set of 10, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6430.16s)]
*  I'll do two sets of five. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6432.8s)]
*  And instead of doing 30 reps over three sets, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6434.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm doing 30 reps over six sets. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6438.92s)]
*  But I'm doing the same amount of work. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6440.8s)]
*  I'm just taking big breaks in between the work. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6442.08s)]
*  They're probably better work. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6444.32s)]
*  Better form. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6446.72s)]
*  And then you don't get as sore either. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6447.72s)]
*  There's this homeless guy in New York, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6450.6s)]
*  and every time he passes a scaffolding, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6452.4400000000005s)]
*  he'll just do 10 pull-ups. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6454.0s)]
*  And he is ripped. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6456.360000000001s)]
*  Pull-ups would have been, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6458.64s)]
*  in hindsight, pull-ups would have been the shit. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6460.360000000001s)]
*  To be able to do 100 pull-ups a day [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6462.6s)]
*  would have been fucking insane. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6465.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but here's the thing about that. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6466.120000000001s)]
*  Pull-ups, like uniquely, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6467.64s)]
*  especially if you're as big as you are, [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6469.72s)]
*  could uniquely damage your joints. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6471.280000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6472.88s)]
*  At 380, it gets that big? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6473.72s)]
*  At 900 pounds, when you're doing 100 in a day. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6474.56s)]
*  And you're having the DEs. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6479.4400000000005s)]
*  So wait, hold on, hold on. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6481.400000000001s)]
*  This is a good point. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6483.4800000000005s)]
*  This is a good point. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6484.320000000001s)]
*  This is a good point. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6485.160000000001s)]
*  Do you think that my push-ups are harder [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6486.0s)]
*  than your push-ups? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6488.88s)]
*  Oh, good point. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6489.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6490.56s)]
*  Can you do a pull-up? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6491.400000000001s)]
*  No, they are harder. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6492.240000000001s)]
*  His are harder. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6493.08s)]
*  Your body weight squats are harder. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6493.92s)]
*  Your chin-ups are harder. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6495.280000000001s)]
*  His tummy touches the ground after 20s of them. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6496.240000000001s)]
*  So then here's the real question. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6498.08s)]
*  Do the math, Jamie, if you can. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6499.68s)]
*  Yeah, I should do more work than you. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6500.52s)]
*  I should have to do more. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6501.8s)]
*  If we did push-ups per person, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6503.0s)]
*  meaning 40 push-ups for me is like 80 for you. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6506.04s)]
*  I don't think it is like 80, but it's definitely like 50. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6511.2s)]
*  How much do you weigh, Joe? [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6513.96s)]
*  I weigh like 205 right now. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6514.8s)]
*  Same as Tom. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6517.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6518.72s)]
*  And you're a foot shorter? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6519.56s)]
*  I'm eight inches and a half. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6520.4s)]
*  Tom wears lifts. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6524.4s)]
*  If you fucking factored in fat, the biggest problem, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6526.68s)]
*  the other thing is cardio is harder if you're heavier. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6531.16s)]
*  If you're carrying your own body weight [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6535.88s)]
*  and you're doing a treadmill, that's fucking harder. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6537.2s)]
*  But doesn't your heartbeat get faster sooner? [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6539.04s)]
*  So you start burning calories faster. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6540.44s)]
*  In a regular push-up, you lift 64% of your body weight, [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6541.28s)]
*  whereas with a knee push-up, 49%. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6543.6s)]
*  That's not bad. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6545.96s)]
*  Do a lot of reps. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6546.8s)]
*  If you need training, performing the push-up [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6547.68s)]
*  with hands elevated on a 24-inch bench [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6549.6s)]
*  will allow you to lift even less [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6551.28s)]
*  than a knee push-up at 41%. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6552.88s)]
*  People do those when they're rehabbing chest injuries. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6555.5199999999995s)]
*  Knee push-ups? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6558.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, off a bench. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6559.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6560.68s)]
*  Or you can lean on like a wall. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6561.5199999999995s)]
*  So how do we get us on the floor to do push-ups? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6562.48s)]
*  First of all, it was all even. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6565.16s)]
*  Tom and I would have an advantage. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6566.5199999999995s)]
*  Tom and I work out all the time. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6567.96s)]
*  Tom's been working out basically two times a day [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6569.96s)]
*  for the past year. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6572.799999999999s)]
*  And they're so short. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6573.639999999999s)]
*  Legitimate. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6574.48s)]
*  I feel like the Ghost of Christmas passed. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6575.32s)]
*  Legitimate. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6576.92s)]
*  I work out all the time. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6577.759999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you do. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6578.92s)]
*  It's just a little different. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6580.88s)]
*  I work out. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6582.679999999999s)]
*  My whoop, let me go through my whoop. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6583.84s)]
*  I'm sure you're about to have a heart attack [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6586.36s)]
*  most of the time to pick up a weight. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6587.84s)]
*  That's not my point. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6589.679999999999s)]
*  Jamie. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6591.0s)]
*  My point is, Bert, you and I worked out together. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6591.84s)]
*  You get after it. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6595.08s)]
*  Yeah, I get after it. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6595.92s)]
*  We worked out together with John Wolf. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6596.76s)]
*  Oh, they're on my Instagram. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6597.599999999999s)]
*  Take a look at the improvement I've had on my whoop. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6598.44s)]
*  You actually have a big improvement. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6600.48s)]
*  I didn't mean on whoop. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6601.72s)]
*  I just meant overall. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6602.639999999999s)]
*  You physically look better. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6603.76s)]
*  I could tell, like your face looks totally different. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6604.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6606.96s)]
*  I look better. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6607.8s)]
*  My thing will be reeling this. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6608.76s)]
*  Take a look at my whoop recovery. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6611.08s)]
*  Recovery's up 19%. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6613.32s)]
*  Heart rate variability's up 37%. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6615.16s)]
*  What does that mean, heart rate variability? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6617.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know, but it sounds great. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6618.44s)]
*  Sleep efficiency's up 11%. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6620.32s)]
*  Sleep efficiency, 1.2%. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6622.6s)]
*  That's not bad. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6624.200000000001s)]
*  He just did an explanation. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6625.040000000001s)]
*  But his sleep proficiency is good. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6625.88s)]
*  It's 87%. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6628.0s)]
*  That part is amazing. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6629.360000000001s)]
*  That's very good. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6630.200000000001s)]
*  That whoop guy just did an explanation of HRV [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6631.040000000001s)]
*  because I've tried to understand it like three different times [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6633.080000000001s)]
*  and I still don't get it. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6635.240000000001s)]
*  Every time. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6636.080000000001s)]
*  I don't know, but. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6637.360000000001s)]
*  All I know is I can tell you. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6638.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, here it goes. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6639.6s)]
*  There's a variance in variability or two different things. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6640.84s)]
*  Heart rate variability is where the amount of time [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6643.0s)]
*  between your heartbeat fluctuates slightly. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6645.4800000000005s)]
*  Even though these fluctuations are undetectable, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6647.84s)]
*  buh buh buh buh buh. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6650.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6653.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6654.16s)]
*  But we get it. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6655.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6655.839999999999s)]
*  It's better. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6656.679999999999s)]
*  Ari's gotta pee. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6657.5199999999995s)]
*  Go to the bathroom. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6658.36s)]
*  Go to the bathroom. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6659.2s)]
*  Son of a bitch. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6660.04s)]
*  So wait, do you think this month made you healthier? [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6661.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6665.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6666.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it definitely did. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6667.719999999999s)]
*  But it was also interesting to have to work out [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6668.639999999999s)]
*  for a specific amount of calories every single day. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6671.44s)]
*  Can I tell you the part that I think is the best though? [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6673.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6676.36s)]
*  It's the accountability. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6677.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6678.0199999999995s)]
*  You have to do it. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6678.86s)]
*  You have to tell me to do this on my own. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6679.7s)]
*  And I still think I do it, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6681.26s)]
*  but there's something about being accountable [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6683.78s)]
*  to your friends. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6685.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6686.74s)]
*  And also being public. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6687.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm doing this every day. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6688.4s)]
*  You know that people are like, you have to do this. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6689.5s)]
*  It changes it. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6691.66s)]
*  It changes the way your mental approach. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6692.5s)]
*  I also developed some really good circuits. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6694.54s)]
*  I developed some really good ways [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6697.5s)]
*  that I could get a full body workout [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6699.34s)]
*  and blast out the same amount of calories. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6701.46s)]
*  For weight lifting, it was always an hour and a half. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6704.7s)]
*  Because I'd take those times in between sets. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6707.139999999999s)]
*  But for cardio, like that echo bike, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6710.02s)]
*  that rogue echo bike, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6711.74s)]
*  that's the motherfucker of motherfuckers, I think. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6713.02s)]
*  Yeah, that thing's crazy. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6715.18s)]
*  That thing's bad. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6716.02s)]
*  Doing those sprints, those Tabata sprints, [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6716.84s)]
*  so you do 20 second sprint, 10 second rest, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6718.46s)]
*  that was what I was torturing myself with the most. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6720.78s)]
*  I did a lot of Peloton bike, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6723.26s)]
*  which was great when we did it on cardio days. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6725.22s)]
*  And then the thing, if I needed to hit that calorie count [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6727.5s)]
*  and I had limited time, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6731.2s)]
*  the best way for me was to do a kettlebell circuit. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6732.78s)]
*  Mm. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6735.58s)]
*  Because, and with very little breaks, [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6736.42s)]
*  because they would just stay elevated. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6738.94s)]
*  I hate to be like a remedial dude, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6740.219999999999s)]
*  but explain a kettlebell circuit. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6742.219999999999s)]
*  So you do like cleans, like 10 reps, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6744.12s)]
*  clean press, 10 reps, clean press, squat, 10 reps, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6747.259999999999s)]
*  windmill, 10 reps. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6751.0599999999995s)]
*  And no rest. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6752.46s)]
*  No rest. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6753.28s)]
*  No rest, and you go through it. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6754.12s)]
*  Okay, I've done that. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6755.54s)]
*  We would add our pushups to that. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6756.38s)]
*  So we would do like, let's say, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6757.219999999999s)]
*  swings into goblet squats, into split squats, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6758.86s)]
*  put it down, 20 pushups, go back on. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6762.62s)]
*  So if you keep doing that, five sets of that, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6765.42s)]
*  you knock out your 100 pushups. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6767.26s)]
*  And by the end of that, I wouldn't be at the 500, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6768.860000000001s)]
*  but I'd be close. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6771.06s)]
*  So if I was like, I just gotta hit these 500 now, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6772.22s)]
*  I could do it in a pretty limited amount of time. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6774.74s)]
*  How much time would it take you to do that? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6776.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, that circuit would probably take me [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6778.46s)]
*  somewhere in the, I think in like the high 20s, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6781.5s)]
*  the low 30s, something like that. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6785.02s)]
*  Like maybe- 30 minutes. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6786.26s)]
*  Maybe 28 minutes, something like that. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6787.1s)]
*  Wow, so your heart rate's just jacked. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6788.34s)]
*  Jacked. Jacked. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6790.3s)]
*  His heart rate's so that you weren't following [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6791.14s)]
*  his heart rates. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6792.34s)]
*  I was looking at your heart rates. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6793.18s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6794.02s)]
*  Because I couldn't get mine up. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6794.84s)]
*  Mm. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6795.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I could. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6797.139999999999s)]
*  But you were also competing against something, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6797.98s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6800.179999999999s)]
*  Well, I have blood pressure medicine. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6801.0199999999995s)]
*  Right, so that's different. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6802.219999999999s)]
*  I'm on a bunch of pills, which is interesting, [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6803.0599999999995s)]
*  is one day I forgot all my pills, worked out, [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6806.179999999999s)]
*  get to dinner, and I realized I haven't taken [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6809.0599999999995s)]
*  any of my blood pressure. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6810.82s)]
*  So, and I'm sober now, probably 28 days. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6812.3s)]
*  And I take my blood pressure just to see what's at. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6815.719999999999s)]
*  It's fucking normal. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6818.28s)]
*  Yeah. What? [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6819.82s)]
*  And I was like, god damn it, man. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6820.66s)]
*  I could be on no medication. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6821.78s)]
*  You could be. I'm partying. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6823.0199999999995s)]
*  You could be. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6824.099999999999s)]
*  Would you rather keep partying, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6825.620000000001s)]
*  or would you rather get on no medication? [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6827.14s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6829.3s)]
*  You know, I'll tell you right now, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6831.02s)]
*  I have a list of things that are important. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6833.620000000001s)]
*  Number one is not, I don't want to stroke. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6837.5s)]
*  That's number one. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6840.18s)]
*  Jesus. I just don't. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6841.02s)]
*  No, but that's a game changer. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6841.900000000001s)]
*  Because I see dudes run down my street sometimes [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6844.580000000001s)]
*  that have had a stroke, and you go, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6846.780000000001s)]
*  oh, now's when you're healthy, fuck. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6848.860000000001s)]
*  You know? [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6851.740000000001s)]
*  You want to have all use of your body [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6853.360000000001s)]
*  as much as we can at this point. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6855.88s)]
*  We've been through surgeries and whatnot. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6857.64s)]
*  But like, but also I know that seeing a cardiologist [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6859.400000000001s)]
*  regularly keeps me in the okay. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6864.88s)]
*  I need to regulate it somewhat [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6868.46s)]
*  because my lifestyle is not living at a place [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6872.68s)]
*  where I can party the way I used to. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6875.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6876.8s)]
*  Like, I'm just working way too hard. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6877.64s)]
*  But I like partying. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6879.52s)]
*  I like fucking partying. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6880.6s)]
*  I love, it is fun. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6882.8s)]
*  Right, which I think you should just limit [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6883.64s)]
*  the amount of times you do it. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6884.76s)]
*  Yeah, that. Don't stop. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6886.68s)]
*  Go hard, but go hard on occasions where people are around. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6887.6s)]
*  Not just like, sorry buddy. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6890.96s)]
*  Some of like the, [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6892.4800000000005s)]
*  why don't you do the end of the week thing? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6894.92s)]
*  Like you go on the road, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6897.280000000001s)]
*  and you work Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6899.04s)]
*  and then like Saturday night. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6901.6s)]
*  You know? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6903.8s)]
*  You have your night, so you're healthy through the week. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6904.64s)]
*  It's like the equivalent of someone being like, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6907.8s)]
*  I feel like eating fucking. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6909.08s)]
*  Donuts. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6911.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you show up to the store, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6911.84s)]
*  and for whatever reason, Norman and DeRosa are there. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6913.0s)]
*  You're like, oh okay, let's go. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6916.04s)]
*  Okay, but then how often do you party in New York? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6918.36s)]
*  Because that's what you're talking about. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6920.96s)]
*  And I know already the answer. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6922.96s)]
*  A bit too often. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6924.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6925.84s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6926.679999999999s)]
*  Because then it gets to the point where like, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6927.5199999999995s)]
*  well nobody's here, but I want to drink. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6928.799999999999s)]
*  And then it's like, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6931.36s)]
*  eh, this guy's here, that'll do. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6932.679999999999s)]
*  Hey, you want to go hard? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6934.98s)]
*  Freddie Gibbs was at the store the other night. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6936.92s)]
*  I don't know if Freddie Gibbs, but I'm a fan. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6939.84s)]
*  I saw him rap with this kid in his lap. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6941.360000000001s)]
*  I thought it was cool as shit. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6943.04s)]
*  He walks back. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6944.76s)]
*  Because Freddie gets Bee Gees? [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6945.6s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6947.56s)]
*  And so Brian Moses introduces us, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6948.400000000001s)]
*  and I'm like, oh cool, and they're like, [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6954.08s)]
*  hey, you want a drink? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6956.12s)]
*  Famous rapper. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6956.96s)]
*  And part of me goes, I know that tonight's not the night. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6957.78s)]
*  None of my friends are there, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6960.96s)]
*  but if Freddie Gibbs wants to have a drink, [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6962.6s)]
*  I'm gonna have a drink with him. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6964.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6964.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6965.8s)]
*  And that's the times when you shouldn't. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6966.62s)]
*  You should go, ah, nothing great's gonna happen [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=6967.72s)]

*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7314.28s)]

*  And then I go from that to push ups [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7623.72s)]
*  and then I go from that to body weight squats. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7625.92s)]
*  You know what was fucking rad? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7627.84s)]
*  Coach Wolf. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7630.16s)]
*  John Wolf. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7631.28s)]
*  John Wolf. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7632.12s)]
*  So who we know, everybody knows. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7632.96s)]
*  I went there one day and he did this mobility. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7634.4800000000005s)]
*  Like the hip stuff? [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7638.68s)]
*  Warm up, but it was full body. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7639.52s)]
*  Just to pre-workout. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7642.12s)]
*  And it felt like a fucking full guy. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7643.28s)]
*  He's like now we're, it was like 20 minutes, 30 minutes. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7645.48s)]
*  If we can get like, we all see some video that we like, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7648.759999999999s)]
*  like this is, do this every day. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7652.32s)]
*  It was incredible. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7653.48s)]
*  I mean, it felt like a full fucking body workout. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7654.32s)]
*  And it was just his mobility stuff. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7657.12s)]
*  Who's the gay guy with the short shorts? [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7659.32s)]
*  Let's all do that one. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7660.44s)]
*  Richard Simmons? [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7662.36s)]
*  Richard Simmons. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7663.2s)]
*  Let's all do Richard Simmons workout. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7664.04s)]
*  Those workouts are lit. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7665.879999999999s)]
*  Those are hard. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7666.719999999999s)]
*  How about we hit up the wolves? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7667.54s)]
*  Why don't we get Wolf to give us- [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7668.5199999999995s)]
*  Sweat into the oldies. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7669.759999999999s)]
*  Why don't we get Wolf to give us like a mobility workout? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7671.0s)]
*  That's not bad. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7673.56s)]
*  We definitely can go down, [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7674.400000000001s)]
*  or we can get Wolf to give us a different workout every day [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7675.22s)]
*  and we have to do it. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7678.24s)]
*  But the problem with that is like you guys are touring. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7679.36s)]
*  But he did- [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7681.96s)]
*  But you want something that- [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7682.8s)]
*  This mobility stuff was also like, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7683.88s)]
*  I wanna say, except for one part of it [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7686.32s)]
*  where we use kettlebells, it was all using your body. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7688.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7691.04s)]
*  It was like bear crawl. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7691.88s)]
*  And like, and all this stuff that you're like, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7693.16s)]
*  holy shit, you feel your body working so hard. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7694.4800000000005s)]
*  And it was just the precursor to the workout. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7697.68s)]
*  It was pretty awesome. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7701.200000000001s)]
*  I did Nate's workout once. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7702.04s)]
*  I saw him in Vegas. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7703.4800000000005s)]
*  He was there for Scaning Fest one day. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7704.320000000001s)]
*  You know, Nate Barghatze. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7705.76s)]
*  And he has a trainer on the road with him. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7707.06s)]
*  And he was like, he gave me the workout for the day. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7708.6s)]
*  I just did it with him. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7710.08s)]
*  And it was a lot of like, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7710.96s)]
*  put your leg up on a thing and then dip, dips, dips, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7711.84s)]
*  and then like walk across the gym with holding a weight [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7714.92s)]
*  and do pushups. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7717.64s)]
*  Farmers walk, yeah. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7718.4800000000005s)]
*  It was tough. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7719.320000000001s)]
*  It didn't get you 500 calories, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7720.76s)]
*  but I was sore all over the next day. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7722.0s)]
*  That kind of farmers walk shit, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7724.4800000000005s)]
*  they say that's like one of the best workouts for your core. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7725.88s)]
*  You're supposed to do it in, you know what that is? [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7728.04s)]
*  Yeah, you just walk around. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7731.64s)]
*  But they say the key is to actually hold it in one hand. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7732.52s)]
*  Like the key is to do like one hand, one side, [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7736.12s)]
*  like a heavy weight on one side. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7738.68s)]
*  Cause you have to compensate with the other side [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7739.92s)]
*  and then you switch. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7741.56s)]
*  And you go back the other way. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7742.400000000001s)]
*  And then doing it with two, [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7743.240000000001s)]
*  it's almost like you let the weights hang down, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7744.92s)]
*  they balance each other out. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7747.08s)]
*  It actually makes it a little easier. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7748.4800000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7751.360000000001s)]
*  That's how this works. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7752.200000000001s)]
*  One all the way down, all the way back, pushups. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7753.04s)]
*  Then the other all the way down, all the way back, pushups. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7755.160000000001s)]
*  Cause you have to balance out that way. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7757.0s)]
*  Instead of the weights balancing you out. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7758.84s)]
*  Is there something that like, and I say this, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7761.360000000001s)]
*  I wish I knew what I was saying, [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7764.280000000001s)]
*  but like Keith Weber in like a, [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7766.040000000001s)]
*  like the cool thing about pushups is that I knew [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7769.4400000000005s)]
*  that I could just get out of bed and go do them. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7771.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7774.6s)]
*  I would like a squat pushup. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7775.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's what I'm alluding to for this mobility stuff [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7776.88s)]
*  is getting one that is without weights. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7779.080000000001s)]
*  Because somebody like him can design one [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7781.040000000001s)]
*  that is challenging as fuck. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7783.68s)]
*  So if you could do it through the day, [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7785.4800000000005s)]
*  I was at Billy Joel and I was like with Sal [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7787.080000000001s)]
*  Justin Silver and Big Jay and they're like, [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7790.36s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7792.84s)]
*  I'm doing pushups. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7793.96s)]
*  It's great. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7795.24s)]
*  Like I have to get these in. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7796.08s)]
*  You did them in the Roger Waters green room. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7797.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7799.32s)]
*  You just got to get them in. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7800.16s)]
*  I like that. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7801.2s)]
*  I like that. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7802.04s)]
*  Roger Waters and Ari's in there banging out his pushups. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7802.88s)]
*  Can you get John Wolf on the phone to talk about [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7804.88s)]
*  for sure. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7807.4800000000005s)]
*  Right now so that we can solidify. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7808.32s)]
*  No, I don't want to call him right now. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7809.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll call him. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7810.92s)]
*  It's rude. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7812.04s)]
*  Call him. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7812.88s)]
*  Bring him into a podcast. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7813.7s)]
*  You talk a lot about calling him. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7814.54s)]
*  We'll talk about him afterwards. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7815.38s)]
*  We'll figure something out afterwards. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7816.4400000000005s)]
*  I think we have to announce it now [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7818.6s)]
*  or it's not going to happen. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7820.12s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7821.320000000001s)]
*  Because people like. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7822.160000000001s)]
*  We can come up with a thing right now. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7823.0s)]
*  Talisker cross Atlantic challenge. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7824.08s)]
*  I like body squats. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7825.72s)]
*  I only just recently started getting low on a body squat. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7827.88s)]
*  We can 100% get stuff to Ari. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7831.280000000001s)]
*  Like if you want some kettlebells, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7835.08s)]
*  we could ship you some kettlebells [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7836.900000000001s)]
*  so we can have them there for you. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7838.68s)]
*  Dude, let's do it. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7840.320000000001s)]
*  It has to be small. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7841.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they can be real small. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7842.0s)]
*  Kettlebell, you know like a 25 pound kettlebell [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7843.360000000001s)]
*  is like that big. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7845.160000000001s)]
*  I can store those somewhere. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7846.0s)]
*  That's a good weight. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7847.0s)]
*  I have no space. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7847.84s)]
*  It sounds like a light weight but it's really not. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7848.66s)]
*  If you do all that body weight stuff [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7850.88s)]
*  with a 25 pound kettlebell. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7853.24s)]
*  Like that guy Keith Weber. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=7854.92s)]

*  Fucking shit. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8303.26s)]
*  Now it's time for old Tommy 2 dips. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8307.98s)]
*  I gotta do pushups too? [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8310.66s)]
*  But Tommy has a real issue. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8311.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8313.3s)]
*  With his back. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8314.14s)]
*  Tell everybody your issue. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8314.96s)]
*  I got this. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8316.18s)]
*  Some dude came on his back. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8317.78s)]
*  Some guy came on my back, but no, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8319.02s)]
*  I went to see my nerve doctor for my arm, [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8320.82s)]
*  and he noticed that the left side of my back [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8325.54s)]
*  has atrophy, you know? [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8328.16s)]
*  And so I thought it was related [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8331.38s)]
*  to the injury and recovering. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8333.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8335.26s)]
*  Right, so like, cause when I was injured, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8336.1s)]
*  obviously you didn't do anything, [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8337.5s)]
*  so then you come back and I've been active since then, [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8338.98s)]
*  but I have like pain a lot of times in my arm [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8341.779999999999s)]
*  or in my lats and you know, weird pains in my shoulder. [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8344.9s)]
*  So I'm like, yeah, it's all related to like recovering [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8347.859999999999s)]
*  from this injury. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8350.66s)]
*  So he saw me do a pushup without a shirt on. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8352.779999999999s)]
*  He's like, the right side of your back [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8355.9s)]
*  is like fully developed, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8358.1s)]
*  and you can see that the left side is not. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8360.42s)]
*  And he said that we have to verify it, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8362.619999999999s)]
*  that it's... [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8365.46s)]
*  Homosexuality? [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8367.939999999999s)]
*  Homosexuality, but it's also related to what he thinks [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8369.62s)]
*  is nerve compression originating from the spine, [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8371.58s)]
*  but unrelated to my injury. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8374.74s)]
*  So that the nerve is not firing. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8376.820000000002s)]
*  Well that might have been. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8377.66s)]
*  Like it was always there? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8378.5s)]
*  It might have not been unrelated. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8379.320000000002s)]
*  Well he's like. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8380.74s)]
*  The way you fell, you could have easily hurt that [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8381.58s)]
*  in the process. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8383.74s)]
*  You're right, and it could be that. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8384.58s)]
*  But wait, so what does it do? [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8386.300000000001s)]
*  Well it's just that like, everything's not firing as well [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8387.74s)]
*  on the left side. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8391.26s)]
*  So there's like less muscle development in my back. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8392.300000000001s)]
*  Things that are painful, [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8396.94s)]
*  like lat pull downs at a certain weight, [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8398.1s)]
*  I can feel it. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8400.619999999999s)]
*  Oh for real? [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8401.46s)]
*  Did you get an MRI? [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8402.3s)]
*  I'm getting one. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8403.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8404.619999999999s)]
*  So do you do workouts around it? [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8406.26s)]
*  No, what they told me, [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8408.46s)]
*  cause I've been doing it for a while now, [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8410.74s)]
*  is just to be mindful of, [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8412.26s)]
*  like if something hurts, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8413.98s)]
*  sometimes you go like, [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8415.3s)]
*  I'll just keep going. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8416.14s)]
*  He's like, dial it back. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8416.98s)]
*  Oh interesting. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8418.34s)]
*  Don't get injured. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8419.18s)]
*  It was bizarre, he showed it to us. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8420.02s)]
*  And you could see it, you could literally see it. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8422.14s)]
*  I can still do pushups, [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8424.66s)]
*  but like, you just feel it differently. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=8425.86s)]

*  to fighters in particular, [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9209.46s)]

*  I couldn't believe it. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9258.32s)]
*  And it wasn't the end. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9259.14s)]
*  Just this weekend. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9259.98s)]
*  Knocked down Anderson Silva. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9260.82s)]
*  I can't deny that the dude's fucking athletic as fuck. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9261.7s)]
*  He's got chops for sure, man. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9264.7s)]
*  But people size you up by based on [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9265.7s)]
*  what they see was the first time. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9267.74s)]
*  So they see you as a Disney guy, [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9269.26s)]
*  and then they go, you'll never be a fighter. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9270.98s)]
*  And then you go, okay, I'm also something else. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9272.98s)]
*  And they say Anderson Silva as the 24-year-old fighter [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9275.18s)]
*  and not the 45-year-old. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9278.34s)]
*  Yeah, and by the way, we should point something out. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9279.58s)]
*  Some people are trying to say that that fight was fixed [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9281.22s)]
*  because of the knockdown. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9283.46s)]
*  If you please, if you find that, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9284.78s)]
*  there's a video where people are questioning. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9286.18s)]
*  I just want to explain to people, this is what happened. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9287.64s)]
*  Anderson moved forward to Jake Paul, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9290.02s)]
*  and Jake Paul hit him with sort of a stepping jab [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9292.26s)]
*  and caught him right on the chin. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9295.42s)]
*  And when he caught him on the chin, [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9297.42s)]
*  Anderson Silva was falling backwards, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9299.220000000001s)]
*  and then he leans away from the right hand and he goes down. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9301.82s)]
*  He tripped. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9304.7s)]
*  And it looks like, no, no, no, he was down from the punch. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9305.52s)]
*  But it looks like the right hand doesn't connect [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9307.36s)]
*  and it doesn't connect. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9308.86s)]
*  But the left hand is what fucked him up. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9309.78s)]
*  That left, that dude hits fucking hard. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9311.78s)]
*  And for anybody to say he doesn't hit hard [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9314.380000000001s)]
*  because he's a YouTube star, [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9316.54s)]
*  this guy was not a fucking YouTube star. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9318.060000000001s)]
*  And he was some dude who went out there and flatlined [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9321.220000000001s)]
*  Tyron Woodley with one punch and just knocked down [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9324.220000000001s)]
*  Anderson Silva in the fucking eighth round, right? [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9326.74s)]
*  Drag him right there! [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9330.060000000001s)]

*  Listen, if this is what he wants to do, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9360.1s)]
*  this guy is making a fucking insane amount of money. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9361.9s)]
*  Is he really? [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9364.5s)]
*  And he fucking loves it. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9365.34s)]
*  And he's beating people that everybody says [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9367.3s)]
*  he shouldn't be in the fucking ring with. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9369.5s)]
*  But is he, hang on. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9371.02s)]
*  Because I'm not an internet guy as much as you guys. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9372.9s)]
*  Is he making a ton of money? [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9377.199999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9378.039999999999s)]
*  He is on these fights. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9378.88s)]
*  I don't follow this shit. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9380.08s)]
*  Well, you just asked me. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9380.92s)]
*  He is on these fights. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9381.74s)]
*  It's his promotion that put this together. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9383.0s)]
*  I don't know how successful it was, but. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9384.68s)]
*  But that's his promotion. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9386.519999999999s)]
*  That's my point, hold on. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9387.359999999999s)]
*  That's my point. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9388.199999999999s)]
*  I'm sure, a lot of people watched it. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9389.039999999999s)]
*  I know that. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9389.939999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people were talking about it online. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9390.779999999999s)]
*  But what money is he making? [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9391.619999999999s)]
*  Because Dana says he's not. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9392.519999999999s)]
*  I don't know if Dana has access [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9395.0s)]
*  to the amount he's making. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9396.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if it's public. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9398.8s)]
*  I legitimately don't know. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9400.16s)]
*  I legitimately don't know. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9402.199999999999s)]
*  But from what I understand, [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9403.519999999999s)]
*  he's fucking the main seller of pay-per-view in these cards. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9405.76s)]
*  And these cards are doing pretty well. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9410.52s)]
*  So that means he's making some money. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9411.880000000001s)]
*  Making some money. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9413.14s)]
*  You know, you be the judge of how much money he's making. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9413.98s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9416.48s)]
*  He's made $40 million from his three fights in 2021. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9417.32s)]
*  Well, there you go. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9420.32s)]
*  He's made $40 million fighting. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9421.52s)]
*  I mean, he's probably making as much, [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9423.48s)]
*  if not more, than any other boxer alive [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9425.64s)]
*  other than maybe say Tyson Fury. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9427.84s)]
*  And then he just adds on his Instagram. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9429.64s)]
*  Or maybe Canelo Alvarez. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9430.48s)]
*  Canelo is making probably the most of anybody, right? [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9431.880000000001s)]
*  Canelo's got a crazy contract. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9434.6s)]
*  Canelo's the fucking king of the kings, right? [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9436.519999999999s)]
*  But he's out for a while now. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9437.84s)]
*  He had to get like a wrist surgery. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9439.119999999999s)]
*  He had a fucked up. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9440.92s)]
*  Did he? [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9442.16s)]
*  Yeah, he had a fucked up wrist. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9442.98s)]
*  And it might take many, many months for him to get back. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9443.92s)]
*  So it's like, other than him, [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9448.14s)]
*  it's like Tyson Fury's the next big dog. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9449.359999999999s)]
*  If, you know, and maybe the biggest of big dogs [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9451.32s)]
*  if he's fighting Usyk, right? [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9453.76s)]
*  He makes more than those guys. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9455.039999999999s)]
*  He makes more than all those guys? [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9456.96s)]
*  No, not more than, but in that range, right? [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9458.8s)]
*  He's making top tier fighting money. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9462.519999999999s)]
*  Canelo's number one. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9465.6s)]
*  Because he's basically, people think he's, [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9466.44s)]
*  other than Beval who just beat him, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9467.44s)]
*  but Beval beat him in a weight class above his. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9468.820000000002s)]
*  He's the pound for pound, most people think. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9472.04s)]
*  Like the fact that the guy had the balls [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9473.960000000001s)]
*  to go all the way up to 75 and not just knock out Kovalev, [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9476.28s)]
*  who was a former champion, [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9479.160000000002s)]
*  but then take on Beval who's undefeated [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9480.240000000002s)]
*  at the top of his game and lose a decision to him. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9482.04s)]
*  It's not even his weight class. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9484.640000000001s)]
*  Not even close, yeah. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9485.84s)]
*  No, I mean, he's like really was at his prime at like 54. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9486.68s)]
*  You know, and he just can, he's so good. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9490.04s)]
*  He could fight anywhere. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9492.68s)]
*  You're talking about Canelo? [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9493.52s)]
*  Yes, dude, Canelo's fucking phenomenal. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9494.36s)]
*  I don't follow enough of this shit. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9496.28s)]
*  So he's like probably the number one pay-per-view draw, [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9497.480000000001s)]
*  along with Tyson Fury. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9500.08s)]
*  I think Tyson Fury's like, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9501.36s)]
*  whenever the heavyweights go, so does boxing. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9502.560000000001s)]
*  That's like an old saying. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9504.68s)]
*  And with Tyson Fury being the fucking king, [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9505.640000000001s)]
*  he's so marketable and he's so extraordinary. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9508.880000000001s)]
*  And his accomplishments, the fact that he beat Deontay Wilder, [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9512.52s)]
*  everybody gets knocked out by Deontay Wilder. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9514.960000000001s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9516.720000000001s)]
*  He's the only one who gets off the deck and beats him. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9517.560000000001s)]
*  The power punching is fucking insane. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9518.400000000001s)]
*  And then stops him in the third fight. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9519.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, dude, Tyson Fury's a fucking monster. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9521.960000000001s)]
*  One of the greatest heavyweights of all time. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9525.0s)]
*  Unquestionably. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9526.72s)]
*  Doesn't get the credit for it though, really. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9527.56s)]
*  If he retires today, Tyson Fury goes down [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9528.84s)]
*  as one of the all-time greatest heavyweights. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9531.04s)]
*  He deserves to be mentioned with Joe Lewis and Mike Tyson. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9533.24s)]
*  Like what would happen if those guys get together? [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9535.960000000001s)]
*  If he fought Lennox Lewis in his prime? [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9538.64s)]
*  He's in that level. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9540.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9541.44s)]
*  He's so good. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9542.28s)]
*  He's so big. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9543.52s)]
*  Because no one cares about boxing as much anymore. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9544.36s)]
*  It's not the case. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9545.6s)]
*  It's just like there has to be like big fights. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9546.72s)]
*  The UFC has big fights constantly. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9548.8s)]
*  Constantly. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9551.72s)]
*  It's not as big as it was. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9552.56s)]
*  It was the only game in town before. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9554.44s)]
*  Boxing. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9556.0s)]
*  And now UFC is the game in town. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9556.84s)]
*  I remember Dana White telling me, [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9558.039999999999s)]
*  and it seemed unreasonable. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9560.8s)]
*  He goes, I wanna be bigger than the NFL. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9562.32s)]
*  And I was like, good luck bro. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9564.4s)]
*  And he by far did it. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9565.96s)]
*  Hey, what's up with Dana White [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9568.08s)]
*  with the Heyo Be Dead in five years? [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9570.32s)]
*  Oh, he apparently went to some doctor [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9573.52s)]
*  who examined his lifestyle and Dana was overweight [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9575.88s)]
*  and he wasn't feeling well [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9579.4s)]
*  and he was having sleep apnea and all those different things. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9581.52s)]
*  And this doctor put him on a diet and exercise regime. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9583.4s)]
*  He said, listen, I've been really accurate [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9586.6s)]
*  about this kind of thing. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9588.4s)]
*  Like this is where this goes. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9589.24s)]
*  And this is nothing but bad news in the future [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9590.08s)]
*  if you don't make a radical change [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9593.24s)]
*  in your health and your lifestyle. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9594.52s)]
*  And so he started, he basically eats kind of keto. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9596.16s)]
*  You know, like he cut out all the bullshit. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9598.92s)]
*  And look at him now. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9600.72s)]
*  He looks fucking great. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9601.56s)]
*  He looks crocking great. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9603.08s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9604.16s)]

*  That really is. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9884.6s)]
*  The thing about Whitney that is great about her now [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9885.44s)]
*  is that she feels like she's doing jazz with her comedy. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9888.12s)]
*  Like, meaning like, you know, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9892.2s)]

*  And when you get someone like Whitney, [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9897.94s)]

*  That's my blood pressure. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9985.800000000001s)]
*  The- [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9987.12s)]
*  You know what? [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9987.960000000001s)]
*  I know, I know, I know. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9988.800000000001s)]
*  So what is the comfortable medium [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9989.62s)]
*  between hardcore partying Bert and Bert [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9992.12s)]
*  that is gonna live for a long time? [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9994.640000000001s)]
*  You tell me. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9996.36s)]
*  You know you said to me a long time ago. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9997.2s)]
*  Twice a week heavy drinking. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9998.04s)]
*  Long time ago we walked into the store [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=9999.720000000001s)]
*  and you said this. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10001.720000000001s)]
*  You said a few things to me that [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10002.560000000001s)]
*  you get Joe Rogan and then you get Joe Rogan as a friend [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10005.220000000001s)]
*  where you do your eye shift and you go, [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10007.480000000001s)]
*  hey man, you gotta stop drinking. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10009.640000000001s)]

*  So you tell me, what's the medium? [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10013.52s)]
*  Because I'm not gonna stop drinking. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10016.6s)]
*  I like this, I like this. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10017.960000000001s)]
*  Well and you also are, unfortunately or fortunately, [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10019.28s)]
*  you are spreading mad joy to the world with that activity. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10023.36s)]
*  Dude. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10027.640000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of connected in some sort of a way. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10028.48s)]
*  But the key is how do you balance it out? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10031.08s)]
*  And how do, what did we get out of this month? [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10033.560000000001s)]
*  And I think we got something out of this month. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10035.880000000001s)]
*  One thing that we all got is [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10037.36s)]
*  if you are forced to do a hard workout every day, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10038.880000000001s)]
*  your anxiety becomes almost nothing. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10042.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10044.16s)]
*  You think it's the working out? [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10045.0s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10045.84s)]
*  Not the lack of booze and weed? [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10046.68s)]
*  No, I guarantee you it's the working out. [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10047.56s)]
*  Really? [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10050.64s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10051.48s)]
*  It burns out that part of your body [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10052.32s)]
*  that is worried about threats. [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10054.44s)]
*  Like if you think about the actual amount [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10056.36s)]
*  of exterior threats that become significant in your life, [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10058.48s)]
*  it's fairly low. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10060.98s)]
*  But all your life you're like dealing with [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10062.34s)]
*  the fucking news of the world. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10064.84s)]
*  I'm late, I gotta deal with this guy, [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10066.6s)]
*  I gotta deal with that. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10067.92s)]
*  This guy's got cancer and he's afraid of that [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10068.76s)]
*  and she's afraid of this and everyone's on the medication [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10071.6s)]
*  and there's all this chaos. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10074.32s)]
*  There's this always like this external thing [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10076.04s)]
*  and crime is up and look at all the tents [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10078.36s)]
*  and fucking traffic is all the fucking global warming [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10080.52s)]
*  and everything's happening and everybody's fucking stressed [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10083.640000000001s)]
*  whether you need to be or not. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10087.2s)]
*  And the only thing that gets you out of that [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10088.48s)]
*  in my experience is something that you have to do [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10090.36s)]
*  that's hard because when things are hard [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10093.32s)]
*  you can only think about the thing you're doing. [[02:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10095.44s)]
*  So whether it's rowing or whether it's riding [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10097.220000000001s)]
*  on the fucking air dine or whether it's doing [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10099.2s)]
*  a kettlebell circuit, when it's hard to do [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10101.2s)]
*  you only think about the thing you're doing. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10104.0s)]
*  And it clears your mind and it releases your body [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10106.32s)]
*  of a certain amount of pent up anxiety [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10109.16s)]
*  that it associates with physical conflict. [[02:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10111.56s)]

*  Yeah, not impossible. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10179.42s)]
*  If you took just pushups out. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10180.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10182.24s)]

*  and it's like, ugh, I gotta do something. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10184.88s)]
*  Here's the thing about the pushups. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10186.84s)]
*  I wonder if we're ultimately putting ourselves at risk. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10187.68s)]

*  I think that's the most important thing. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10193.400000000001s)]
*  The thing about the 100 pushups is, [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10194.720000000001s)]
*  we all did it, but I was getting a weird [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10196.68s)]
*  fucking pain in my elbow. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10198.720000000001s)]
*  I couldn't hold my phone to my ear. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10200.12s)]
*  I just keep switching hands. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10201.320000000002s)]
*  That was in the beginning because you didn't [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10202.6s)]
*  work out at all. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10203.92s)]
*  So you jumped into it, where I was already doing [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10204.76s)]
*  sets of pushups, but I wasn't doing 100 [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10207.04s)]
*  every single fucking day. [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10209.140000000001s)]
*  But I didn't think you could. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10210.68s)]
*  And then your body adapts. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10212.28s)]
*  Your body realizes, oh, you have to. [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10214.16s)]
*  I guess you have to. [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10216.32s)]
*  You're fucking doing it every day. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10217.16s)]
*  And for me, it was like as long as I didn't do long sets, [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10217.98s)]
*  I only did sets of 20. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10220.76s)]
*  And only one time I did 40. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10221.92s)]
*  I was like, oh, I could do 40. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10223.72s)]
*  75, dude. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10224.84s)]
*  I thought 40. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10225.68s)]
*  75's pretty legit, buddy. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10226.68s)]
*  I wonder if I warmed up if I could do more. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10228.800000000001s)]
*  I bet. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10230.44s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10231.28s)]
*  Yeah, you could. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10232.12s)]
*  But I think four or five of the last ones were bullshit. [[02:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10232.94s)]
*  At least four. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10236.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's kinda, it's cause you get fatigued. [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10237.32s)]
*  32 of mine were pretty legit. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10238.960000000001s)]
*  I got to some weird spot where I was like, [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10240.56s)]
*  I would call bullshit on that pushup. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10243.64s)]
*  Interesting enough. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10246.2s)]
*  But you realize that your body's capable [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10247.04s)]
*  more than you asked for. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10249.84s)]
*  Totally. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10251.0s)]
*  Your body's capable of much more. [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10251.84s)]
*  You'd be shocked at what I call bullshit on. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10253.560000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked at all. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10256.32s)]
*  I know exactly. [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10257.68s)]
*  You lurked in the back of my mind. [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10258.92s)]
*  You live there. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10261.26s)]
*  Let Bert drive you to success. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10262.24s)]
*  Yeah, if Bert fucking challenges me in any way, [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10263.720000000001s)]
*  it just fucking ignites a fury inside of me. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10266.48s)]
*  If we had only got into this on standup, [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10268.28s)]
*  we'd be so much better. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10270.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, if I could do seven sets a day. [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10271.36s)]
*  I wish I saw your standup the way I see your exercise. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10273.44s)]
*  Ah, it's possible. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10277.4s)]
*  Can we do that once? [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10278.24s)]
*  My exercise is in stain. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10279.44s)]
*  Do five sets a day for five days a week? [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10280.92s)]
*  What we should do, what we should do. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10283.28s)]

*  I think this is the wrong way to do it. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10362.34s)]
*  You're wrong. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10364.140000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10364.980000000001s)]
*  You're wrong. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10365.820000000002s)]
*  You can't say this so. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10366.640000000001s)]
*  You go hard, you go fucking hard. [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10367.480000000001s)]
*  You can't say that, you don't have to. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10368.300000000001s)]
*  Dude, we're only alive for a little bit, [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10369.140000000001s)]
*  and you get to fucking fill it up. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10371.18s)]
*  Yeah, but you gotta go on a ski trip during that time. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10373.18s)]
*  I like other things too. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10374.820000000002s)]
*  I like a lot of other things too. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10377.02s)]
*  And I think it makes my comedy better [[02:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10379.42s)]
*  when I live my life in a way [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10381.380000000001s)]
*  that makes other things interesting too. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10383.660000000002s)]
*  My take on it is different than your take on it. [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10386.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't mean your take's wrong. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10388.86s)]
*  It's just that my take on it, for me. [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10390.220000000001s)]
*  I think it's completely unwise what we're doing. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10391.62s)]
*  For me to be mentally healthy, [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10393.7s)]
*  I don't like going on the road for long stretches of time. [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10396.900000000001s)]
*  I only did it one time, [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10398.82s)]
*  and I saw a big benefit in my standup [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10399.900000000001s)]
*  when Charlie Murphy and John Heffron [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10402.1s)]
*  and I did this Maxim tour, 22 dates in a month. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10403.900000000001s)]
*  By the end of that 20 second show, [[02:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10407.82s)]
*  you're fucking, you're killing it. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10410.12s)]
*  And then you're back. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10412.58s)]
*  Hold on. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10413.74s)]
*  Can I tell you my flip side of that is, [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10414.74s)]
*  let's hypothetically say we're talking about [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10417.42s)]
*  a comic who gets a Netflix special [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10420.300000000001s)]
*  and only does three weekends to get ready for a special. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10421.94s)]
*  Thank you, Ari. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10426.98s)]
*  But I feel like if I don't do everything in my capability [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10428.5s)]
*  to get ready for that special, [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10435.26s)]
*  then I'm letting down myself, my family, and everyone else. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10437.140000000001s)]
*  And I feel like when it comes to standup, [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10441.220000000001s)]
*  the one thing I can do good, right? [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10444.44s)]
*  The only thing I can do good, [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10446.06s)]
*  if I don't put everything I have into that, [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10448.22s)]
*  then I'm letting myself down, really. [[02:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10451.98s)]
*  You are in many ways. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10455.539999999999s)]
*  Okay, when you're done with that special, [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10457.24s)]
*  you take three months off. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10460.38s)]
*  Can't. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10461.82s)]
*  Okay, well then, that's not what you said. [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10462.66s)]
*  I'm not that guy. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10464.14s)]
*  But here's what I'm saying. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10464.98s)]
*  Here's what I'm saying. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10465.82s)]
*  But don't you love the thing? [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10466.66s)]
*  Don't you love baking? [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10468.119999999999s)]
*  If you're a baker, don't you love baking? [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10469.24s)]
*  Yeah, you bake at home. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10470.08s)]
*  You're in Live in L.A. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10471.279999999999s)]
*  You could do a set at night. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10472.119999999999s)]
*  You could do 10 sets at night. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10472.96s)]
*  This is my take on creativity, though. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10474.06s)]
*  I think creativity is like a flexible thing [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10476.38s)]
*  inside your head. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10479.16s)]
*  And I think you have to put yourself in the states of mind [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10480.0s)]
*  in order to broaden, expand the way you see life, [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10483.0s)]
*  and that enhances your creativity. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10487.039999999999s)]
*  And for me, that is a lot of shows, [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10489.42s)]
*  but it's also a lot of shows at home. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10493.42s)]
*  I like to just do sets. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10495.82s)]
*  I just like to do sets. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10496.98s)]
*  Sets are sets. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10497.82s)]
*  Sets are sets. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10498.66s)]
*  Sets are sets. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10499.5s)]
*  Sets are sets. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10500.32s)]
*  Sets are sets. [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10501.16s)]
*  But this is my take. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10502.0s)]
*  Sets are sets, that's what he's saying. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10502.82s)]
*  Sets aren't sets. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10504.58s)]
*  That's what he's saying is that for him, [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10505.42s)]
*  a set at home is better than a set on the road. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10507.14s)]
*  It's not necessarily better. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10509.539999999999s)]
*  It's just the most important thing is your way [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10510.699999999999s)]
*  of looking at the world [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10513.66s)]
*  and that you're actually doing standup. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10515.279999999999s)]
*  Those are the two, in my opinion. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10516.94s)]
*  They're paying you to get on a plane. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10518.58s)]
*  They're not paying you to perform. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10519.82s)]
*  There's also a benefit to going to do different places. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10521.02s)]
*  There's a benefit to different cities and different vibes [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10523.9s)]
*  and different parts of the world. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10526.4s)]
*  And there's a benefit to that, too. [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10527.779999999999s)]
*  But the biggest thing is to just always be working on it. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10529.619999999999s)]
*  And that's what I'm saying. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10534.18s)]
*  I'm not saying that you're not gonna do it [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10535.02s)]
*  in some way, shape, or form. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10536.86s)]
*  So you don't have to do it only on the road. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10538.22s)]
*  Even fucking listening to it. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10540.06s)]
*  I'm not the guy that, [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10540.9s)]
*  maybe I should have prefaced this with it. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10543.74s)]
*  If I'm home, I do feel like being with my family. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10547.02s)]
*  I can do it Tuesday night, but I'm not there Monday, [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10550.34s)]
*  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10552.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10555.66s)]
*  I wanna live a life so that for me to go out [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10556.5s)]
*  and be on a tour bus and be on the road, [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10559.58s)]
*  I'm focused on the thing I love. [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10562.06s)]
*  And that's all I think about. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10564.42s)]
*  I don't think about it. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10565.42s)]
*  And I'm sure it's my daughter, Georgie. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10566.26s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that. [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10568.78s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that approach either. [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10569.94s)]
*  It's like everybody's got their own personality [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10572.06s)]
*  and it vibes their own approach [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10574.38s)]
*  to what the fuck we're trying to do. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10575.7s)]
*  But what we're trying to do is just like constantly crank out [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10577.26s)]
*  really good comedy. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10579.58s)]
*  Yeah, how do you get there as part of it? [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10580.62s)]
*  How do you get there? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10582.460000000001s)]
*  Do you get there by doing 15 minutes [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10583.3s)]
*  around New York City like a tell does? [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10584.62s)]
*  Because he fucking got there. [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10586.34s)]
*  I don't know how he's doing it. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10588.22s)]
*  He's the fucking the best. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10589.18s)]
*  So he's doing it that way. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10591.26s)]
*  And then there's other guys that are just on the road [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10592.26s)]
*  doing clubs and you go out of your way to see them [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10594.42s)]
*  when they come into town. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10597.220000000001s)]
*  Because you wanna see what the fuck they're up to [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10598.380000000001s)]
*  because they're really good. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10600.34s)]
*  There's no right or wrong way to do this. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10601.62s)]
*  Can I suggest something? [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10603.86s)]
*  Please. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10605.02s)]
*  I just wanna say it before we get out of here. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10605.86s)]
*  I really think, it's on you guys, not on me, [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10607.94s)]
*  that in September we should do some massive shows. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10611.060000000001s)]
*  Joe and Tom will headline Bert, can MC all park cars. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10615.5s)]
*  Let's do some fucking wild massive shows. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10620.9s)]
*  Let's do some sober October shows. [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10623.54s)]

*  I never did that. [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10923.380000000001s)]
*  I needed, you understand this better than I do. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10924.220000000001s)]

*  You need to understand it. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10928.42s)]
*  Well, you're not gonna get it [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10930.02s)]
*  because you had everything you wanted [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10930.980000000001s)]
*  when you had a family. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10933.140000000001s)]
*  So you could prioritize your family. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10934.5s)]
*  You already had success. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10936.02s)]
*  Yeah, you had success. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10936.94s)]
*  When you started dropping seeds. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10937.78s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10938.78s)]
*  I didn't have success when I had a family. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10939.78s)]
*  So like I'd come here and do a podcast with you [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10941.380000000001s)]

*  And then I'd go eat lunch. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10946.62s)]
*  You can understand this more than maybe Tom, [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10947.7s)]
*  but Tom got success and then had a family [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10951.34s)]
*  and then now you cannot, he's like, no, I'm going home. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10954.1s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10957.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's good. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10958.7s)]
*  He's got the right, look, we did a long podcast with him. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10959.52s)]
*  It's the right thing to do. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10962.800000000001s)]

*  Well, we got a show to do, boys. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10965.7s)]
*  I will tell you, Tom, when I was running my hour, [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10967.62s)]
*  I asked him like, hey, can you come in to the store [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=10970.060000000001s)]

*  You just needed to bring your ID. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11009.300000000001s)]

*  it's me and Bill Burr opening at the thing. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11042.26s)]
*  It's like, no, it ain't. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11044.42s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11046.06s)]
*  It's Bill Burr, motherfucker. [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11046.9s)]
*  It's Bill Burr and his mom. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11047.74s)]
*  His mom could talk shit about him for 10 minutes, [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11049.66s)]
*  then bring him up, but he's still crushed. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11051.42s)]
*  Bill Burr does not need anyone to do standup with. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11052.26s)]
*  There's zero people to support him. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11055.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's that, and we're appreciative. [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11056.86s)]
*  I get to do it on the road, I get to do a show. [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11058.82s)]
*  You and I say we didn't get to do shows on the road. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11061.74s)]
*  I had a conversation with Bill on the phone the other day [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11064.34s)]
*  and it was like, God, I miss that dude. [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11066.02s)]
*  Just talking to him, just hearing the way he talk shit [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11068.14s)]
*  about things, we're laughing, [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11070.539999999999s)]
*  and I was like, God, I miss that dude. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11072.22s)]
*  He's the dude I think I miss the most [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11074.06s)]
*  that I've seen at the store all the time, constantly. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11075.66s)]
*  I think I miss him the most, [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11078.699999999999s)]
*  because everybody else, I see you guys. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11079.9s)]
*  I see all you guys. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11081.98s)]
*  I only see him when he comes to Texas. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11082.82s)]
*  Once or twice a year. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11085.02s)]
*  I really miss seeing him around the store, [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11086.14s)]
*  because he's like a tortured guy, [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11088.38s)]
*  but he's so fucking brilliant. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11089.74s)]
*  He's funny with it. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11091.1s)]
*  He's such a good person. [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11091.94s)]
*  He's a good person. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11093.06s)]
*  You hug that guy, that's a real hug. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11095.460000000001s)]
*  The cool thing about podcasts [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11100.9s)]
*  is it's an excuse to see your friends. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11101.94s)]
*  Comedy is a fucking weird thing, man. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11103.62s)]
*  So many of us get entangled together in comedy. [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11106.18s)]
*  Tangled in careers, entangled in. [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11110.3s)]
*  Even Marin, who I would never, [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11113.1s)]
*  we never hang out at the store. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11114.98s)]
*  When you do a podcast with him, [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11116.82s)]
*  it's cool to catch up with him. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11117.98s)]
*  He's a fucking mess, [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11121.5s)]
*  but if I saw him at the airport, I'd give him a hug. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11122.34s)]
*  I've met him at the airport before, [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11125.06s)]
*  and I was like, dude. [[03:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11126.5s)]
*  It's like Stan Hope said, [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11128.140000000001s)]
*  it's like, fuck off with this infighting. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11128.98s)]
*  It's a comic and you're not. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11131.300000000001s)]
*  The problem is, it's normal to say those things. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11133.34s)]
*  It's totally normal to say those things. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11136.140000000001s)]
*  The problem is when you're saying those things online. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11137.98s)]
*  That's the thing. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11140.66s)]
*  It's the same. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11141.5s)]
*  Know your platform you're on. [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11142.34s)]
*  Don't say shit publicly. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11143.18s)]
*  It's the same as saying those things. [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11144.02s)]
*  It's normal to say those things. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11146.14s)]
*  And it's normal, it doesn't even bother me. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11147.54s)]
*  But when you're saying it online, [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11149.46s)]
*  then you're bringing all these other people in [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11150.46s)]
*  to cheer with you. [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11152.18s)]
*  You gotta know what this is at this point. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11153.02s)]
*  Or fight against you. [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11153.86s)]
*  Exactly. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11154.7s)]
*  It's hard because your ego gets involved. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11155.54s)]
*  You gotta know what conflict is [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11157.9s)]
*  and why it's not only not necessary, [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11159.3s)]
*  but should be avoided whenever possible. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11162.58s)]
*  And if you're not avoiding it, [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11165.98s)]
*  if you're waiting into it, conflict, constantly, [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11167.26s)]
*  you should look at yourself a little bit. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11170.26s)]
*  I will agree with that as someone who has done it [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11171.699999999999s)]
*  and regrets it. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11174.38s)]
*  Yes. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11175.58s)]
*  Don't do it. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11176.42s)]
*  I've done it too. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11177.26s)]
*  We've all done it. When did you do it [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11178.08s)]
*  that you regretted it? [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11178.92s)]
*  I mean, nevermind. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11179.76s)]
*  When did you do it that you didn't regret it? [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11180.58s)]
*  Yeah, I've always regretted it. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11182.22s)]
*  You don't talk shit about your friends. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11183.3s)]
*  It feels terrible. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11184.46s)]
*  Don't talk shit about your not friends. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11185.42s)]
*  There's an impulsive thing that people have [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11186.5s)]
*  to say things that are outrageous. [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11188.42s)]
*  And sometimes we get rewarded for that. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11190.019999999999s)]
*  And so we'll say things that are outrageous [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11192.58s)]
*  and we don't think about the consequences [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11194.42s)]
*  of saying those things. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11195.939999999999s)]
*  We're not saying those things because we're bad. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11196.779999999999s)]
*  We're saying those things [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11198.939999999999s)]
*  because we're taking a chance at an idea. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11200.26s)]
*  And sometimes you're saying it about a friend [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11201.74s)]
*  and you're fucking hurting their feelings [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11204.66s)]
*  you don't mean to. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11205.900000000001s)]
*  You thought it was funny. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11206.820000000002s)]
*  I thought it was funny. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11208.140000000001s)]
*  And they're like, fuck you, man. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11209.02s)]
*  And you're like, shit. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11210.66s)]
*  And you can't take it back. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11212.1s)]
*  And you just were having fun. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11213.220000000001s)]
*  And if you were just alone, he said that, [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11214.460000000001s)]
*  they might think it's funny. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11216.5s)]
*  Trash talk behind someone's back is fine. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11217.74s)]
*  That's part of being a friend. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11220.1s)]
*  The problem is if you forget [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11221.5s)]
*  that that's not just those people there, [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11223.460000000001s)]
*  you're bringing the whole world into it. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11225.42s)]
*  It's this. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11226.26s)]
*  You feel like you're just talking to friends. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11227.1s)]
*  It's just like you should avoid conflict [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11228.1s)]
*  that is unnecessary. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11231.980000000001s)]
*  Even if you have a disagreement with someone. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11233.34s)]
*  Don't concentrate on that. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11235.58s)]
*  Concentrate on the fun shit. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJKXPy82HRI&t=11237.1s)]
