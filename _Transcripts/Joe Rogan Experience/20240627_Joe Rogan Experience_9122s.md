*  Oh that's a good spot [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=34.0s)]

*  Yeah, that's a good spot [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=36.0s)]

*  That was good [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=43.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=44.0s)]
*  And of course hit the Terry B's on Martin Luther King Day so it was empty, it was nice [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=45.0s)]
*  Suerte you have the added benefit of being around people with masks [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=49.0s)]
*  That's like East Austin [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=52.0s)]
*  I haven't seen any masks [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=55.0s)]
*  You haven't seen any? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=56.0s)]
*  No, I think, well I did in Vancouver, I was in Vancouver before this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=57.0s)]
*  Oh they were [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=62.0s)]
*  They never stopped [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=63.0s)]
*  No, they're still going, yeah [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=64.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's wild, there's a San Francisco like town hall meeting and they passed a vote to stop for a ceasefire in Palestine [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=65.0s)]
*  I saw it, yeah [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so they're all masked up and they're dancing around and they got blue hair [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=76.0s)]
*  And somebody made a caption that this is literally South Park [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=81.0s)]
*  This is literally an episode of South Park [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=85.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=87.0s)]
*  They look like fucking complete maniacs left in this worn torn shattered hull of a city [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=88.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=95.0s)]
*  And whatever's left is filled with human shit and tents everywhere and they're dancing around [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=96.0s)]
*  And they've stopped a ceasefire in Palestine, yeah, we voted for it, stop, stop it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=101.0s)]
*  They solved it in Oakland [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=107.0s)]
*  Like as if Benjamin Netanyahu is paying attention [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=109.0s)]
*  Right, like that's gonna work [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=112.0s)]
*  I guess I'll stop now [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=113.0s)]
*  Yeah, he stopped traffic on the way to the airport in New York and that'll do it [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah, that does it, that generally does it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=118.0s)]
*  That's what Netanyahu was waiting for, he's like alright, now I've, I've seen the error in my ways now [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=120.0s)]
*  Now I gotta pull back [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=127.0s)]
*  Now I gotta pull back [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=128.0s)]
*  I did go a little too far, let me back up [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=129.0s)]
*  Yeah, let me back it up right now [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=130.0s)]
*  They're stopping traffic, this is serious [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=131.0s)]
*  I saw in Austin, I saw three people on the overpass just holding up a free Palestine thing and I'm going like [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=133.0s)]
*  I bet those people have amazing productive lives and they're not crazy at all [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah, not at all, no [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=146.0s)]
*  They got nothing, they got a full schedule of things to do and they took a lot of time out of their schedule to stand on top of the highway [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=147.0s)]
*  They're super healthy, they're really into mindfulness, they're on the ball every day, they get everything done [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=153.0s)]
*  Every one of them, every one of them has an alert for what they have to do next on their very busy schedule [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=160.0s)]
*  Free Palestine, I wasn't gonna [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=166.0s)]
*  Those people just [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=169.0s)]
*  But I saw your banner [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah, till the banner came up [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=171.0s)]
*  Yeah, those people are just perpetuating the situation over there, it's like the whole is it right or wrong thing, it's like it's obviously wrong [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=173.0s)]
*  Humans have always been wrong when it comes to that, it's always been about power, who's got more power and who has less [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=180.0s)]
*  It's very multi-layered, that's the thing about any international conflict [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=188.0s)]
*  You can look at the mainstream media narrative, you know, they did this and then they did that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=194.0s)]
*  But then it's like Ukraine and Russia, like you say, oh my God, Russia invaded Ukraine, this is horrible [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=199.0s)]
*  And that's most people's natural reaction to it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=205.0s)]
*  And then when you go, wait a minute, was there a rule, did they make an agreement to not push arms closer to Russia? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=208.0s)]
*  Did they consistently violate that agreement? Did they? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=215.0s)]
*  They try to move Ukraine, I was reading about them trying to move Ukraine into NATO, like what? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=218.0s)]
*  What are you, a Putin supporter? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=223.0s)]
*  Are you a Putin supporter? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=225.0s)]
*  No, wait a minute, isn't this a very multifaceted, super complex international conflict that really is about a lot of things [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=226.0s)]
*  It's not just about Russia and Ukraine, it's about NATO, it's about nuclear arms being pushed closer to a superpower [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=238.0s)]
*  It's like, there's more to it [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=246.0s)]
*  There's more to it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=249.0s)]
*  There's more to all of it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=250.0s)]
*  And usually that's why war breaks out, is because it's so multi-layered and then it gets to that breaking point [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=251.0s)]
*  It's just wild that they could still pull off war today [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=257.0s)]
*  War, which is essentially like hijacking resources or controlling parcels of land [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=260.0s)]
*  It's weird that they could still talk people into that today [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=265.0s)]
*  Because it's kind of an old hustle, it's almost like old radio [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=272.0s)]
*  It's such an old hustle that you can get people to believe these people hate you for your freedom or whatever it is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=274.0s)]
*  And then you go over, oh let's fucking shuttle up and go kick their ass [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=280.0s)]
*  It's kind of amazing, given what we know about the true nature of conflicts [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=284.0s)]
*  And how so many things are manipulated behind the scenes to force people into actual physical conflict [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=289.0s)]
*  And then there's generals that sit in air-conditioned offices and they move their pieces around the board like chess pieces [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=305.0s)]
*  Human lives [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=307.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they don't fight, they're never in the front [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=308.0s)]
*  Never [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=310.0s)]
*  I don't even think Alexander the Great was in the front [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=311.0s)]
*  I don't buy it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=313.0s)]
*  Well he didn't live long [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=314.0s)]
*  Alexander the Great, he died like, he was like 40 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=315.0s)]
*  Yeah, didn't they die young back then? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=318.0s)]
*  Oh yeah [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=320.0s)]
*  And he died of like some sickness, he didn't die from like a battle wound [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=321.0s)]
*  I think probably all died of sickness [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=324.0s)]
*  Can you, but can you survive if you're in the front back then? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=326.0s)]
*  No [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=329.0s)]
*  It was like a human meat factory [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=330.0s)]
*  No, you're not gonna survive [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=331.0s)]
*  He was in the back [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=332.0s)]
*  Most likely you're not gonna survive [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=333.0s)]
*  I feel like back then, like sickness probably really kicked in when we started gathering together and throwing our shit out the window [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=334.0s)]
*  Or actual shit, like human shit [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=342.0s)]
*  Like if you think about the cities of ancient times before there was plumbing [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=345.0s)]
*  Do you know how horrific that must have been? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=350.0s)]
*  Oh history, history smelled, yeah [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=353.0s)]
*  We don't remember, we weren't there, we assume every place is like Target [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=355.0s)]
*  We assume every place is like a fucking rest stop on the highway, you can go in and take a shit [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=360.0s)]
*  No, no, people were shitting out windows, they were throwing their shit in buckets [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=367.0s)]
*  According to Wikipedia, he was a very productive 20 year old, 20 something [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=372.0s)]
*  He was 20? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=378.0s)]
*  When he took over as king [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=379.0s)]
*  Whoa [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah, he conquered the world, he was in his early 20s [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=382.0s)]
*  What a gangster [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=384.0s)]
*  Look at this, by the age of 20, okay he succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=385.0s)]
*  And spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign through western Asia and Egypt [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=394.0s)]
*  By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=399.0s)]
*  Holy shit, stretching from Greece to northwestern India [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=404.0s)]
*  He was undefeated in battle and widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=409.0s)]
*  And wasn't he also gay? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=415.0s)]
*  He was bi! [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=417.0s)]
*  Was he bi? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=418.0s)]
*  That was the way back then, yeah [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=419.0s)]
*  Is that what he was? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=421.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=422.0s)]
*  Student of Aristotle, and there was, we've read that question [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=423.0s)]
*  Wow [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=426.0s)]
*  We've talked about how those relationships were [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=427.0s)]
*  Tutored by, yeah, those questions, those relationships were uncomfortable [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=428.0s)]
*  Those guys all fucked those kids [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=433.0s)]
*  They had eunuchs [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=435.0s)]
*  There was those? Yeah, they had eunuchs and then they just had young boys [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=436.0s)]
*  What did it say about the Aristotle thing though? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=440.0s)]
*  Can you go back to that quote? Where was it? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=442.0s)]
*  I accidentally clicked something in the bottom of the page [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=444.0s)]
*  What a huge page, that guy did a lot of shit [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=446.0s)]
*  It says by the age of 16, until the age of 16 rather, Alexander was, by 16 he was too old [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=449.0s)]
*  Aristotle was like, get out of here you old fuck, bring me a young boy [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=454.0s)]
*  In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=459.0s)]
*  He campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over the, how do you say that, Thrace? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=465.0s)]
*  Thrace [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=470.0s)]
*  And parts of Illyria? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=471.0s)]
*  Illyria [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=472.0s)]
*  Illyria, Illyria, you should be saying this [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=473.0s)]
*  This is your native tongue, this is basically, I went to Greece this summer [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=476.0s)]
*  How'd you like it? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=480.0s)]
*  Amazing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=481.0s)]
*  Your people did some wild shit dude [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=482.0s)]
*  Yeah, we did [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=483.0s)]
*  Your people did some wild shit [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=484.0s)]
*  We did [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=486.0s)]
*  When you're in a place where [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=487.0s)]
*  Like Doug Stanhope said, I didn't do anything [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=488.0s)]
*  I was on the couch [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=490.0s)]
*  Your people, I'm saying your people, your team [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=491.0s)]
*  If the Lakers win, you didn't throw a ball [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=493.0s)]
*  My tribe [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=495.0s)]
*  We won [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=496.0s)]
*  The only thing we didn't do is create an empire [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=497.0s)]
*  Because we were too busy infighting, which is typically Greek [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=499.0s)]
*  Well, you can't do everything [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=502.0s)]
*  Can't do everything [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=505.0s)]
*  Did a lot more than a lot of other cultures 2500 years ago [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=506.0s)]
*  Did a lot with mathematics, philosophy [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=509.0s)]
*  Democracy [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=512.0s)]
*  Democracy [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=513.0s)]
*  We did a lot [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=514.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot with drugs too [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=515.0s)]
*  A lot with drugs, a lot with pedophilia [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=516.0s)]
*  Have you ever read that book, The Immortality Key? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=518.0s)]
*  No [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=522.0s)]
*  It's about the Illucinian mysteries [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=523.0s)]
*  It's this guy, Brian Murorescu [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=525.0s)]
*  And Brian's been a guest on the podcast before [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=527.0s)]
*  And he's a scholar who is like a straight-laced guy [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=530.0s)]
*  Doesn't do drugs, nothing [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=534.0s)]
*  And he, through all of his courses [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=536.0s)]
*  They were trying to figure out like what they were doing in this Illucinian mysteries [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=540.0s)]
*  Like why were people going from all over the world to have these experiences [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=544.0s)]
*  And what were these experiences [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=547.0s)]
*  So they recently discovered that inside these pottery vessels [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=549.0s)]
*  That they used to contain wine and beer in [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=553.0s)]
*  They found ergot [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=556.0s)]
*  And ergot is a very potent psychedelic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=557.0s)]
*  It's like a fungus [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=560.0s)]
*  I think it's akin to LSD [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=562.0s)]
*  And so they're very, at the very least [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=564.0s)]
*  Were taking that in this one spot [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=567.0s)]
*  And what they believe is that all of these [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=570.0s)]
*  Like transcendent experiences they had [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=574.0s)]
*  These Illucinian mysteries [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=576.0s)]
*  They get together and figure out how to solve the world [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=578.0s)]
*  And let people vote [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=580.0s)]
*  And all that wacky [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=582.0s)]
*  That's all, I'm tripping balls [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=583.0s)]
*  This is my idea shit [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=585.0s)]
*  And it's literally the birthplace of democracy [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=586.0s)]
*  It's literally how the world changed for the better [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=588.0s)]
*  And your people were doing it 2500 years ago [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=591.0s)]
*  And you can walk in the same spots where they walked [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=596.0s)]
*  And you can see the buildings that they built [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=599.0s)]
*  It's weird [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=601.0s)]
*  It's weird when shit is that old [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=602.0s)]
*  And you can just walk on it [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=604.0s)]
*  Like the Parthenon, you just walk around [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=606.0s)]
*  And you can marvel at how durable what they built is [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=608.0s)]
*  2000 years is so long [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=613.0s)]
*  There'll be no [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=616.0s)]
*  Yeah, in 2000 years from now you're not going to see any strip malls still standing [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=617.0s)]
*  They'll literally be dust [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=621.0s)]
*  They'll be dust [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=623.0s)]
*  They built things really well back then [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=624.0s)]
*  It's a great effort too [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=627.0s)]
*  To do that, like the kind of precision that's involved in the Parthenon [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=629.0s)]
*  When you're walking around it [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=634.0s)]
*  And you see how all the stone is cut [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=636.0s)]
*  And how it lines up [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=638.0s)]
*  And how massive the columns are [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=639.0s)]
*  And how beautifully symmetric it is [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=641.0s)]
*  It's so smooth and clean [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=644.0s)]
*  And these people didn't have engines [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=646.0s)]
*  No, it's crazy [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=649.0s)]
*  There was no engine [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=650.0s)]
*  This was all done by hand [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=652.0s)]
*  It was all think, think, think [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=654.0s)]
*  Slavery [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=657.0s)]
*  A craftsmanship [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=658.0s)]
*  You weren't just getting the crudest of people [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=660.0s)]
*  You were getting artisans [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=662.0s)]
*  You probably worked against your will [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=664.0s)]
*  To move those big rocks and stuff [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=666.0s)]
*  100% [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=668.0s)]
*  Who the fuck knows how they did that? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=669.0s)]
*  What the hell were they doing back then? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=672.0s)]
*  They did some wild shit back then [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=674.0s)]
*  When we think about human ingenuity [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=676.0s)]
*  God, we're missing so much [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=678.0s)]
*  They didn't leave like [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=682.0s)]
*  Here's a book on how we did it [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=683.0s)]
*  This is where we got the rocks [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=685.0s)]
*  This is how we cut them [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=686.0s)]
*  This is the best way to move them [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=687.0s)]
*  If you move them this way [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=689.0s)]
*  They'll fall on you and you'll kill a few guys [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=690.0s)]
*  This is what we figured out over time [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=692.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=694.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy to think about [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=695.0s)]
*  And I agree with you [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=697.0s)]
*  I think it was drugs that opened people's minds up to think about things [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=698.0s)]
*  Yeah, it gave them a completely different perspective [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=703.0s)]
*  Carl Sagan once said that about marijuana [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=707.0s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing him [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=709.0s)]
*  But essentially he was saying that it offers you a perspective [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=710.0s)]
*  That's not available without the drug [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=714.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=716.0s)]
*  That's why I think mushrooms are getting popular for depression, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=717.0s)]
*  It sort of takes you off those grooves that are created by the neuro connections [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=724.0s)]
*  Just gives you a new perspective [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=725.0s)]
*  I wonder how much, I mean, there's certainly different kinds of depression [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=726.0s)]
*  There's depression that's clearly something wrong chemically with some people [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=731.0s)]
*  But how much of it is just from not being healthy? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=736.0s)]
*  How much of not being healthy with your body and not being healthy with where your life is going? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=739.0s)]
*  Like what kind of job you have, what you want to do with your life? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=746.0s)]
*  That's got to be some of it [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=749.0s)]
*  The friendships you have [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=751.0s)]
*  All your friends suck [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=752.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's got to be a big part of it [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=753.0s)]
*  And I think trauma, I think childhood trauma [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=755.0s)]
*  I think childhood trauma kind of can make you depressed [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=757.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=762.0s)]
*  For sure [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=763.0s)]
*  Especially abuse [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=764.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=765.0s)]
*  Abuse seems like the one that people have the hardest time shaking [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=766.0s)]
*  It's because it's not, it wasn't even that they were ignored [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=768.0s)]
*  That someone preyed on them [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=775.0s)]
*  And they have no self-worth, they're beaten [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=776.0s)]
*  They have no self-worth [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=778.0s)]
*  And they know that the younger the abuse or the neglect happened [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=780.0s)]
*  The more of an imprint it leaves because your brain is forming [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=785.0s)]
*  It's fascinating stuff, man [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=789.0s)]
*  But we have neuroplasticity and you can go to therapy [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=791.0s)]
*  And EDMR is something I'm doing and it's incredible [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=795.0s)]
*  It's the only thing I've ever done that sort of works [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=798.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=802.0s)]
*  EDMR was invented by Francine Shapiro like in the 80s accidentally [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=803.0s)]
*  She's a psychologist [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=808.0s)]
*  And now it's become sort of the gold standard for trauma treatment and PTSD and like vet hospitals and stuff [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=809.0s)]
*  And what it is is it's IED, it's eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=816.0s)]
*  And so it involves moving your eyes in a very specific way while you process traumatic memories [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=828.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing it now [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=834.0s)]
*  Whoa [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=836.0s)]
*  It's crazy [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=837.0s)]
*  Oh my God, you're hacking your brain [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=838.0s)]
*  You hack your brain and you get into your subconscious like your REM sleep state [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=839.0s)]
*  And then you reprocess the memories and when you're there you start having vivid memories [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=843.0s)]
*  And then when you're done memories start flying in out of nowhere [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=848.0s)]
*  Whoa, how did you find out about this? This is wild [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=852.0s)]
*  It was interesting, I was in LA, right? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=855.0s)]
*  So I have early childhood trauma and then I've had some traumatic things happen to me later in life [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=858.0s)]
*  And then the panic attacks started after I got shot when I was in my early 20s [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=864.0s)]
*  I didn't know what they were back then [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=867.0s)]
*  I just didn't know what they were so I'd just be having these panic attacks in the train [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=870.0s)]
*  Just going like what is happening to me? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=874.0s)]
*  So I've been dealing with it for like 20 years and it would go away for periods [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=876.0s)]
*  I'd have great periods and then it would come back [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=879.0s)]
*  And after I had kids, I think I called you, I spoke to you once and you were very helpful [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=882.0s)]
*  But after I had kids it sort of triggered a lot of these feelings that would come up out of nowhere [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=888.0s)]
*  And sadness, I'd be looking at my kids and I'd get sad, I'd be playing with them [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=895.0s)]
*  I'd get sad and I didn't understand it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=899.0s)]
*  And then I'd be in a hotel room on the road and I'd just start panicking and I'd be like what is this? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=901.0s)]
*  And so I was talking to my friend, Tracy Carnazzo [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=908.0s)]
*  She's a comic in New York, she's funny [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=912.0s)]
*  And she's one of these Italian girls who's just got a guy for everything [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=915.0s)]
*  You ask her anything, she's like I know somebody [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=919.0s)]
*  So she asked, she was like how are you? And I just answered honestly [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=922.0s)]
*  I was like ah, and I gave her like a paragraph [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=925.0s)]
*  And she was like it sounds like you didn't feel safe as a kid [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=929.0s)]
*  She was like let me get you in touch with this person who I'm friends with who does EDMR [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=933.0s)]
*  And then I got in touch with this therapist and she's incredible [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=937.0s)]
*  And I started the EDMR journey and it's been, it's the only thing I've done [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=941.0s)]
*  And EDMR has a beginning, middle and end [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=946.0s)]
*  It's not like ad infinitum, it just goes on forever [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=948.0s)]
*  It's like you're there to reprocess this trauma [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=952.0s)]
*  And so do you do it at a specific place? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=955.0s)]
*  I do it, I do it at Zoom, I love to Zoom [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=957.0s)]
*  You Zoom? Yeah [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=959.0s)]
*  So you Zoom with someone who guides you through it, is that how it works? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=960.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=963.0s)]
*  And you do it how often? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=964.0s)]
*  I'm doing it now twice a week, but you can do it once a week [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=965.0s)]
*  And how long is each session? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=968.0s)]
*  Hour, she'll go longer sometimes though [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=969.0s)]
*  Wild [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=972.0s)]
*  So what do you, do you feel like the chemicals moving around in your brain while you're doing this? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=973.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah you do [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=980.0s)]
*  And that's a big part of it is identifying the trauma in the body and how it affects the body [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=981.0s)]
*  There's a book called The Body Keeps the Score [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=988.0s)]
*  But I think his name is Bessel, he's a psychiatrist [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=992.0s)]
*  And he's responsible for all these trauma centers all over the country [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=994.0s)]
*  So this guy is doing it to this lady right now [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=999.0s)]
*  He's going back and forth with his fingers and she's following his fingers [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1001.0s)]
*  And so she's supposed to be thinking about traumatic memories [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1005.0s)]
*  So then he'll bring up, he'll take her back through the first phase is like identifying the trauma [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1007.0s)]
*  So it's a lot of talk therapy [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1012.0s)]
*  So you kind of, you know, talk a lot, talk a lot, talk a lot [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1014.0s)]
*  And then the therapist gets the idea of what you need to go back and reprocess [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1018.0s)]
*  And new things will come up when you go back and then you'll reprocess it [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1022.0s)]
*  It's not just hands, you can do, you can follow a ball, you can hold the buzzers in each hand [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1027.0s)]
*  It's about stimulating both sides of your brain [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1032.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1034.0s)]
*  What's happening in mental health now is so fascinating because when you parallel it with like what happened in medicine, right? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1035.0s)]
*  Like we used to treat the symptom, right? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1042.0s)]
*  So if someone had a fever, they treated the fever, but they didn't know what the cause was [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1044.0s)]
*  So they put you in cold water or boiling water, whatever they did [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1047.0s)]
*  And then they found out about viruses and bacteria, so they started treating the cause [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1050.0s)]
*  Now in mental health, you're starting to see that revolution because of, you know, the advances in neuroscience [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1055.0s)]
*  Where they can look at the brain and they can actually see, you know, what parts are responsible for what, where trauma shows up in the brain [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1063.0s)]
*  They just did a recent study, it was a big study about how trauma is, traumatic memories don't come back as memories [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1071.0s)]
*  They come back, they light up in the part of your brain as if it's happening now [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1079.0s)]
*  Which makes sense, we knew that because, you know, when Vietnam vets start bugging out and they're in the supermarket or whatever [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1083.0s)]
*  But they can actually see it now in the brain, that the brain is processing it as it's happening now [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1088.0s)]
*  So, you know, converging neuroscience and psychology and all the things that they've known from all these different advances [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1094.0s)]
*  And it seems to be in a place now where trauma is becoming one of the things that they focus on the most [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1105.0s)]
*  Like early childhood trauma or traumatic events in war, obviously we know that that's the specific cause of what is bothering those people [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1112.0s)]
*  You know, is what they've experienced, and so now they're targeting the trauma, but they have ways to treat the trauma [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1123.0s)]
*  With EDMR, with brain spotting it's called, you know, a whole bunch of these tactics [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1129.0s)]
*  That's really fascinating, it's really fascinating when you think, like I had this guy on the podcast yesterday, Joe Pfeiffer [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1137.0s)]
*  He's an MMA fighter for the UFC, and he had a terrible childhood, terrible, fucking horrible beatings, just constant beatings [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1143.0s)]
*  It's just like heartbreaking to hear the story, but you gotta, it's just fascinating like as a human being [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1151.0s)]
*  Like whoever you are, you're listening to this right now, you are the accumulation of your processing of every experience you've ever had [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1159.0s)]
*  As much as we like to claim autonomy, we think on our own, and we kind of do, and there's that, like again, there's definitely chemical problems [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1167.0s)]
*  There's definitely people that just have a genetic defect, something, just like some people have diseases of all sorts of other parts of their body [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1174.0s)]
*  They get diseases in the brain, that's fucking for real, 100% [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1181.0s)]
*  But you're basically just an end product of experiences, and your interpretation of those experiences [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1184.0s)]
*  And the lessons and the way you've contextualized all those experiences, and they're all in your head, and that's your map of the world [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1192.0s)]
*  That's your map of the world, so if you're in San Francisco, yay we freed Palestine! [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1201.0s)]
*  Like their map of the world is fucked, like their experiences, like what's got them to 2024, January 18th, whatever it is, is this result sucks [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1205.0s)]
*  Like this result sucks, like this is terrible, like you guys are out of your fucking mind, you're wasting your time, there's needles on your street [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1218.0s)]
*  You guys are out of your fucking mind, what are you doing, this result sucks [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1226.0s)]
*  But those people, they could have been in fucking Wyoming, like hard working ranchers, the same human [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1231.0s)]
*  Could have been like a salt of the earth, fucking Kevin Costner, Yellowstone looking motherfucker, it could have been the same, it's just your experiences [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1238.0s)]
*  It's just what shapes you, what directions do you go in, when do you get pushed down, when do you get lifted up, who gives you a hug, who pushes you away [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1246.0s)]
*  And how does this play out? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1255.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think a lot of people know themselves because you gotta do all this work to know yourself [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1257.0s)]
*  Because your brain protects you in so many ways that you're unaware of [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1261.0s)]
*  Like they know in neuroscience, like your brain usually when it's healthy works in concert and sends information to different parts of your brain to process it [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1266.0s)]
*  But when you have trauma or a chemical problem or whatever it is, it doesn't work well [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1274.0s)]
*  And in traumatic experiences, your neocortex shuts off and your limbic turns on and there's a survival reason for that [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1280.0s)]
*  So if you're in a moment of fight or flight, you don't want to start reasoning, you don't want to go like, you start philosophizing [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1292.0s)]
*  You're just emotional, you're dealing with your survival reptile brain and so it actually shuts off [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1299.0s)]
*  So people who have panic and anxiety, it's hard to reason your way out of it because that part of your brain is shut down [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1305.0s)]
*  Now imagine you have panic and anxiety already and you're already experiencing depression [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1311.0s)]
*  And then they prescribe two medications and one of the side effects of that medication is suicide [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1317.0s)]
*  Suicidal ideation [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1325.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1327.0s)]
*  Imagine being that person and forced with that choice [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1330.0s)]
*  Like this may help you or you might just [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1334.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1339.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1340.0s)]
*  Well medication, yeah [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1341.0s)]
*  That's a wild one man [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1342.0s)]
*  Yeah, medication is [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1344.0s)]
*  It can help you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1345.0s)]
*  It can help you [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1346.0s)]
*  But you can also [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1347.0s)]
*  It can hurt you [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1348.0s)]
*  You can go sliding down a hill and there's no trees to grab [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1349.0s)]
*  But every study they do still till now, medication is not the end-all cure [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1352.0s)]
*  Like it just doesn't, it can numb it, it can help you [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1357.0s)]
*  It's definitely good if you're in like a jam, like if you're really in a bad spot [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1361.0s)]
*  It can, but when you do the medication that's when you got to start doing the work [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1366.0s)]
*  You can't just do the medication as an end to fix it [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1370.0s)]
*  But the medication is interfering with the natural system [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1373.0s)]
*  You know what I think it's going to be in the future, medication is going to be like for mental illness, it's going to be like leeches [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1377.0s)]
*  Like oh they used to use leeches, they didn't know any better [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1383.0s)]
*  Oh they used to just put medicine into people, they used to give them chemicals [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1385.0s)]
*  Oh they didn't fix the brain? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1388.0s)]
*  No they just did chemicals [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1390.0s)]
*  Right [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1391.0s)]
*  Why didn't they do the rewiring? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1392.0s)]
*  Oh they had to figure it out [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1393.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1394.0s)]
*  But that, the fucked up thing is that trauma that you experience as a child or those bad [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1395.0s)]
*  The trauma is a very overused word, some people experience real trauma [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1402.0s)]
*  So let me say this, the negative experiences that you've had both as an adult and as a child [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1406.0s)]
*  Those also made you who you are if you're happy with the result [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1414.0s)]
*  Like if you're happy with how you're living, you're happy with what you're doing [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1418.0s)]
*  Those things were important to go through unfortunately [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1421.0s)]
*  Well it's not you can do about them, it happened, you got to make the best out of them [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1425.0s)]
*  And a lot of people do make the best out of them and turn them into something [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1428.0s)]
*  A lot of people do, it is possible [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1433.0s)]
*  And trauma is not necessarily the thing that happened to you, it's how you react to the thing that happened to you I think [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1435.0s)]
*  And everyone's different, everyone has a different level of sensitivity and circumstance and genetic code [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1440.0s)]
*  So I can't really judge anyone's trauma [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1446.0s)]
*  So you can never know how another person feels, you just can't know, you just can't know [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1449.0s)]
*  Unless you're on TikTok, then you can know [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1454.0s)]
*  But yeah I mean if the human race has a chance I think people need to start looking inward [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1458.0s)]
*  Why am I really doing what I'm doing? Who am I really? What is this really about? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1462.0s)]
*  Also this is so temporary, we're treating it like it's permanent [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1468.0s)]
*  It's so temporary [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1471.0s)]
*  You're treating your own life like it's permanent and it's so temporary [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1472.0s)]
*  I've noticed a lot of successful friends I have and a lot of successful people are so scared to just be happy [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1477.0s)]
*  Because I think there's like this deep fear of losing it [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1482.0s)]
*  Yeah that's real [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1485.0s)]
*  So it's like if I stay miserable I don't got to focus on the fear of losing it [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1487.0s)]
*  Yeah that's real [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1491.0s)]
*  Because we all lose it at the end [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1492.0s)]
*  It's that and it's also you have a real fear of not being able to keep doing what you do [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1493.0s)]
*  Like whatever it is that you've done that's successful you just lose the magic, you lose the thing [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1499.0s)]
*  What is it? Now I suck, you know like whatever it is [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1504.0s)]
*  Now I'm not interested, now I'm not interesting, now I can't talk, now I can't do this anymore, I can't do that anymore [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1506.0s)]
*  Nobody likes my music, you know my movies suck [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1512.0s)]
*  Like yeah that fear, it's crippling, crippling fear [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1515.0s)]
*  It's such a crazy fear [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1519.0s)]
*  Yeah it's funny the way things are set up here [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1521.0s)]
*  It's just funny, it's like hey enjoy yourself accumulate all this stuff [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1524.0s)]
*  But you have to have this, you have this knowledge because we have these big brains [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1528.0s)]
*  Like you lose it all, it's all going away [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1532.0s)]
*  It's all gone, Sinatra said that about everything he has [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1534.0s)]
*  You know they were giving him a hard time for giving away so much money and giving people things [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1537.0s)]
*  And he's like this is not mine, I'm renting this, it's going to be gone [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1541.0s)]
*  And it's funny, comedy makes everything okay [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1546.0s)]
*  That's why I think [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1550.0s)]
*  It makes it more fun [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1552.0s)]
*  It makes everything okay, it conquers everything [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1553.0s)]
*  It means when you have a good sense of humor and when you're laughing in the right way [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1556.0s)]
*  Not just cackling by yourself in a room [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1560.0s)]
*  But it just means you're mentally healthy [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1562.0s)]
*  It's a sign of mental health and strength when you can laugh at horrible things [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1564.0s)]
*  That's the way you conquer them [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1568.0s)]
*  Yeah it's also a sign that you're recognizing nuance and you're playing with it [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1570.0s)]
*  Like it doesn't mean that you really think that this tragedy is great [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1574.0s)]
*  You just find something horrible to say that's hilarious about the tragedy [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1578.0s)]
*  And sometimes you can only do that with your friends [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1583.0s)]
*  You can only do that at a deli [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1585.0s)]
*  You can only do that having dinner at one o'clock in the morning just talking shit [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1587.0s)]
*  Making each other laugh [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1592.0s)]
*  But that's also a thing that I think we're really lucky about [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1594.0s)]
*  That's our big gift, our big gift is each other [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1598.0s)]
*  Like as comedians [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1601.0s)]
*  I spend time with a lot of different people [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1603.0s)]
*  And a lot of different occupations [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1606.0s)]
*  I always can't wait to get back to comedians [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1610.0s)]
*  I can't wait to get back to the green room with the mothership [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1612.0s)]
*  Can't wait to do sets on the road [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1615.0s)]
*  It's just the conversations are so much more fun [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1617.0s)]
*  They're so fun [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1621.0s)]
*  Yeah you can say anything [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1622.0s)]
*  And it's just fun [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1624.0s)]
*  Everyone's just being funny and smiling [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1625.0s)]
*  And realizing wow we're so lucky [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1627.0s)]
*  We used to be open mic night comedians [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1630.0s)]
*  And now here we are about to go do a sold out show [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1632.0s)]
*  We're having dinner together at a restaurant and laughing [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1634.0s)]
*  And then you go have fun, yay! [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1637.0s)]
*  And then the people have fun, yay! [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1639.0s)]
*  It's beautiful [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1641.0s)]
*  It's the ultimate connection [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1642.0s)]
*  And the amount of love that you get back and forth [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1643.0s)]
*  Like the amount of love a comic gets [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1646.0s)]
*  The amount of love they give [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1648.0s)]
*  The positive energy both for and back [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1650.0s)]
*  That's like very few people get to experience that in life [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1654.0s)]
*  And it's the only place that comedians can get it [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1658.0s)]
*  It's for mother comedians because we're jaded [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1661.0s)]
*  It's harder for... [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1664.0s)]
*  Also we can speak so freely [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1666.0s)]
*  You can go there's this fucking bit, it's just dead [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1668.0s)]
*  It's got a thing and it goes somewhere and then it drops off [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1671.0s)]
*  And I don't know what the fuck to do with it [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1675.0s)]
*  I've been trying to bunk you around with different ways to say it [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1677.0s)]
*  And switch and they're like hmm [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1680.0s)]
*  And then everybody will sit around and analyze it [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1682.0s)]
*  And we'll analyze each other's bits [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1684.0s)]
*  And you don't have to say that part [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1686.0s)]
*  Everybody already knows that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1688.0s)]
*  If you cut that out it's shorter [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1689.0s)]
*  You're right, why did I say that part? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1690.0s)]
*  And then everybody just starts tinkering with stuff [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1692.0s)]
*  And you can just openly tinker [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1695.0s)]
*  With phrases and ideas and setups [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1697.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1700.0s)]
*  It's like a... [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1701.0s)]
*  So much fun! [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1702.0s)]
*  It's like architects sitting with their contractors figuring it out [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1703.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1709.0s)]
*  If you got a good relationship with the contractor [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1710.0s)]
*  I would imagine the architects and the contractors squabble a lot [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1712.0s)]
*  They do, I'm going through that right now [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1714.0s)]
*  We're putting an addition on our house and yeah they squabble [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1716.0s)]
*  I'm like who do I trust? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1719.0s)]
*  The architect or the contractor? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1720.0s)]
*  Oh no! [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1721.0s)]
*  It's a power struggle for Yanis Papas' love [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1722.0s)]
*  You get in the middle [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1725.0s)]
*  And it's funny because I don't know anything [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1726.0s)]
*  So you're at the mercy [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1728.0s)]
*  You're just so vulnerable [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1730.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1732.0s)]
*  I don't know anything about what they're talking about [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1733.0s)]
*  And I'm like just trying to look in their eyes [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1735.0s)]
*  And figure out which one's more honest [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1737.0s)]
*  And I have no clue, it's just a guess [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1739.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1740.0s)]
*  That was someone was telling me that about the World Trade Center [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1741.0s)]
*  They were saying the World Trade Center was designed to be hit by a jet plane [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1744.0s)]
*  And I don't know if they're right [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1748.0s)]
*  But what they were saying is [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1750.0s)]
*  Do you know how much corruption there is in construction? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1752.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1755.0s)]
*  And I was like no, how much? [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1756.0s)]
*  They go oh, say if it's supposed to get five bolts [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1757.0s)]
*  If you only use four [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1761.0s)]
*  Do you know how much money you save over a whole building? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1763.0s)]
*  If you make the steel that thick instead of that thick [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1765.0s)]
*  Do you know how much money you save? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1769.0s)]
*  If it calls for like half inch this but you use quarter inch that [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1771.0s)]
*  You know how much money you save? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1774.0s)]
*  You gotta pay off the inspectors and all that I guess [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1776.0s)]
*  I guess [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1778.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1779.0s)]
*  Are they really inspecting everything? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1780.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1782.0s)]
*  How does that work? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1783.0s)]
*  You just see how you cross your fingers [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1784.0s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1785.0s)]
*  But my point was always like how the fuck do you know what's gonna happen to a building [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1787.0s)]
*  Until a plane slams into it and you get to watch [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1793.0s)]
*  Right [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1796.0s)]
*  Because there's never been a skyscraper that got hit by a plane before [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1797.0s)]
*  Which makes it interesting [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1800.0s)]
*  You can't say this is not how it should have happened [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1801.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1804.0s)]
*  I have zero idea what it looks like other than 9-11 [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1805.0s)]
*  When jets slam into skyscrapers [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1808.0s)]
*  A plane hit the Empire State Building [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1811.0s)]
*  Big one [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1813.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1815.0s)]
*  The 40 [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1816.0s)]
*  Was it a propeller plane? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1818.0s)]
*  No, it was a big plane [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1819.0s)]
*  Like a jet? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1820.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1821.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1823.0s)]
*  How bad did it fuck it up? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1824.0s)]
*  It slammed right into it [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1825.0s)]
*  Didn't do shit to it? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1826.0s)]
*  B-25 in 1945 [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1827.0s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1829.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1830.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1831.0s)]
*  Listen to these pictures [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1832.0s)]
*  And the buildings fell not because of the plane hitting [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1834.0s)]
*  Oh shit [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1837.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1838.0s)]
*  So that's a big ass old school plane [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1839.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1841.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's a propeller plane [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1842.0s)]
*  Wow [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1846.0s)]
*  Where did it hit? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1848.0s)]
*  Bang, right there [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1849.0s)]
*  Wow [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1850.0s)]
*  79th floor [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1851.0s)]
*  And it didn't take it out? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1853.0s)]
*  No [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1854.0s)]
*  They're built not to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1855.0s)]
*  Is that commensurate though? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1856.0s)]
*  Like how did it hit? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1858.0s)]
*  How did it hit? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1859.0s)]
*  Did it hit just the wing? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1860.0s)]
*  Was the guy trying to pull out? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1861.0s)]
*  No [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1862.0s)]
*  But look at that [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1863.0s)]
*  There's definitely no jet fuel in there [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1864.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1865.0s)]
*  No, no jet fuel [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1866.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1867.0s)]
*  No jet fuel [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1868.0s)]
*  Because the heat from the jet fuel is what took down the trade center [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1869.0s)]
*  Not the plane impact, so to say [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1871.0s)]
*  So they say [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1873.0s)]
*  So they say [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1874.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1875.0s)]
*  But you know who they are, right? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1876.0s)]
*  I mean, well, they, you know, they did [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1877.0s)]
*  I don't know who they are [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1879.0s)]
*  I was hoping I could just sneak that in [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1880.0s)]
*  Someone will tell me [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1882.0s)]
*  I wanted to get into that real soon with some like [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1883.0s)]
*  Alex will tell you [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1884.0s)]
*  Who is that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1885.0s)]
*  Depending on what you're talking about [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1886.0s)]
*  Let's go ahead and do it with Alex [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1887.0s)]
*  Let's go ahead and do it with Alex [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1888.0s)]
*  He's been freaking me out lately [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1889.0s)]
*  The 9-11 is, it's interesting to me [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1890.0s)]
*  People ruin it by coming up with what they think happened [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1893.0s)]
*  Instead of just stopping at, hey, it's fishy [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1896.0s)]
*  It's a little weird just stopping there [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1900.0s)]
*  Because you can't know, you can't know what the actual conspiracy was [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1902.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense on 9-11 [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1908.0s)]
*  Well, whenever you run into a situation where [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1911.0s)]
*  There's a gigantic worldwide disastrous event [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1915.0s)]
*  Like that's an event that the whole world knew about [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1920.0s)]
*  But you lie about some aspects of it [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1923.0s)]
*  Like one of the things was [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1925.0s)]
*  What if the United States get caught lying about Saudi Arabia [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1927.0s)]
*  About their involvement early on with funding? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah, they ignored it [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1935.0s)]
*  I mean, the bin Laden family was flown out before [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1936.0s)]
*  Weird stuff [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1939.0s)]
*  Weird stuff [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1940.0s)]
*  Weird stuff [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1941.0s)]
*  It's like, what if I wanted to do that? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1942.0s)]
*  Would you be mad? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1943.0s)]
*  What if I had some fucking dudes from Afghanistan [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1944.0s)]
*  Staying in my house [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1948.0s)]
*  And right after some shit went down [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1949.0s)]
*  I illegally flew them out of the country [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1951.0s)]
*  Listen, it's cool [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1953.0s)]
*  It's cool [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1954.0s)]
*  That sounds like what a criminal would do [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1955.0s)]
*  That's right [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1957.0s)]
*  It just sounds like what a criminal would do [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1958.0s)]
*  If I was running cocaine with the Colombians [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1960.0s)]
*  And right before the FBI came [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1963.0s)]
*  I fucking shot some planes illegally [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1965.0s)]
*  Filled with coke back to Colombia [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1968.0s)]
*  I'm like, listen, don't worry about it [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1970.0s)]
*  It's okay, this guy's good [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1973.0s)]
*  But you're not allowed to fly right now [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1974.0s)]
*  It's okay [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1976.0s)]
*  It's okay [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1977.0s)]
*  It's just [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1978.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's criminal [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1979.0s)]
*  It's just criminal enterprise [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1980.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1981.0s)]
*  It's okay, it's okay [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1982.0s)]
*  We're just gonna fly [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1983.0s)]
*  We're not gonna tell you [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1984.0s)]
*  We're gonna take the family of the dude who set this up [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1985.0s)]
*  And we're gonna just fly [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1987.0s)]
*  We're gonna get them all out [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1989.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1990.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1991.0s)]
*  Hey, shouldn't we keep them here and investigate? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1992.0s)]
*  It seems like there was some sort of a connection with Saudi Arabia [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1994.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1997.0s)]
*  What about Iraq? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=1999.0s)]
*  That weapons of war, they're gonna kill us all [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2000.0s)]
*  We're gonna all be dead [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2002.0s)]
*  Unless we get in there right now [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2003.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2004.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2005.0s)]
*  It's sort of like with the Epstein thing [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2006.0s)]
*  It's like, isn't [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2007.0s)]
*  I just call her gasoline [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2008.0s)]
*  Because I hate pronouncing her first name [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2010.0s)]
*  Ghislaine [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2011.0s)]
*  Yeah, why not [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2012.0s)]
*  How come there's no [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2013.0s)]
*  They're not interrogating her [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2014.0s)]
*  How come they're not [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2015.0s)]
*  She's just sitting there [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2016.0s)]
*  And they're like leaking these slow leaks about [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2018.0s)]
*  Well, it's even crazier than that [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2020.0s)]
*  It's like, talk to her [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2021.0s)]
*  They have her [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2022.0s)]
*  Is nobody asking her any questions? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2023.0s)]
*  Like, she knows everything [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2026.0s)]
*  Torture her [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2028.0s)]
*  We can't ask her [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2029.0s)]
*  Torture until she says everything [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2030.0s)]
*  Any questions [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2031.0s)]
*  It's not proper [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2032.0s)]
*  And how is she just sitting in her mansion [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2034.0s)]
*  Like, while this was all going down [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2036.0s)]
*  She's just sitting there [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2037.0s)]
*  They can't find her [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2038.0s)]
*  She hasn't been arrested [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2039.0s)]
*  She was in a cabin in New Hampshire [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2040.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2042.0s)]
*  You can find bin Laden [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2043.0s)]
*  But you can't find Ghislaine Maxwell [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2044.0s)]
*  Well, they found her [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2045.0s)]
*  Yeah, they found her for a while [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2046.0s)]
*  Well, she's solo [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2048.0s)]
*  You know, bin Laden had a whole network of people protecting him [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2049.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2052.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2054.0s)]
*  Well, there's the craziest theory is that they didn't shoot bin Laden [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2055.0s)]
*  They shot bin Laden's double [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2058.0s)]
*  That's why they got rid of it [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2059.0s)]
*  Like, there's so many wacko fucking flat earth conspiracy theories out there about everything [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2060.0s)]
*  Yeah, but some of them are not [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2066.0s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are just because people have access to information now [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2068.0s)]
*  And they go, wait a second [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2071.0s)]
*  You know what I also think, cynically [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2072.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2074.0s)]
*  I think there's a lot of really dumb ones [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2075.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of ones that are like a little smarter than dumb [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2077.0s)]
*  And then there's a lot of ones that are really smart [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2081.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of ones that are like, oh my God, if this is true, this changes everything [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2084.0s)]
*  And they all lump them in together [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2088.0s)]
*  And it's genius [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2090.0s)]
*  It's genius [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2091.0s)]
*  Because if you only look at the ones that like the Federal Reserve isn't federal [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2092.0s)]
*  Wait, wait a minute [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2096.0s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2097.0s)]
*  Right [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2098.0s)]
*  What the fuck's going on? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2099.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2100.0s)]
*  You know, like when you just look at one or two of those [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2101.0s)]
*  It's so confounding that that's actually taking place right now [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2103.0s)]
*  That you need like a little flat earth wrote in there [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2108.0s)]
*  A little fucking pizza gate [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2111.0s)]
*  A little Hillary Clinton's laptop [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2112.0s)]
*  They're eating babies [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2114.0s)]
*  You know [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2116.0s)]
*  So you can sneak in Epstein's Island [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2117.0s)]
*  Like that was a real place, man [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2119.0s)]
*  That was a real place [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2121.0s)]
*  And the way a place like that can kind of fly in under the radar [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2123.0s)]
*  Is if there's a bunch of fake stuff [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2128.0s)]
*  Don't go to Antarctica [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2130.0s)]
*  There's an alien base [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2131.0s)]
*  There's like the more nutty shit they can get you to think about [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2133.0s)]
*  The more real things you should be really concerned about [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2137.0s)]
*  Sneak through [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2140.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2141.0s)]
*  Do you think that's intentional? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2142.0s)]
*  100% [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2143.0s)]
*  Spiral with other stuff [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2144.0s)]
*  Both [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2145.0s)]
*  Yeah, both things [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2146.0s)]
*  I think it's both probably [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2147.0s)]
*  It's both, yeah [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2148.0s)]
*  But they're playing on the fact [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2149.0s)]
*  Even if the government wasn't encouraging people to go insane [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2150.0s)]
*  They would still go insane [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2153.0s)]
*  They would still have conspiracy theories [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2154.0s)]
*  But without a doubt [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2156.0s)]
*  Foreign governments are on TikTok and on Instagram and on Facebook [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2158.0s)]
*  And they are influencing people to go in a very specific direction [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2164.0s)]
*  And how much of a percentage is it? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2167.0s)]
*  If their algorithm encourages like transpositive content [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2170.0s)]
*  How much does that move the public narrative? [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2175.0s)]
*  It's not zero [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2178.0s)]
*  It's not zero [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2180.0s)]
*  No [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2181.0s)]
*  So if you got two ships [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2182.0s)]
*  And they're both going in the same direction [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2183.0s)]
*  Parallel lines [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2185.0s)]
*  And I could turn this one ship just like that [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2186.0s)]
*  Just a little bit [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2188.0s)]
*  I just need like a couple of degrees of turn [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2189.0s)]
*  Over time [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2191.0s)]
*  That motherfucker is going to be way off course [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2192.0s)]
*  Way off course [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2195.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2196.0s)]
*  I think that's happening [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2197.0s)]
*  For fucking sure [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2198.0s)]
*  That's the way war is waged now [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2200.0s)]
*  And it's also happening with people that think they're doing the right thing [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2202.0s)]
*  Like we were talking about Google the other day [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2206.0s)]
*  And like how YouTube censors things [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2209.0s)]
*  Like they think they're doing it [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2211.0s)]
*  They think they're doing the right thing [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2213.0s)]
*  I was reading [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2214.0s)]
*  Is this true that gas digitals all their stuff got taken off the air? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2215.0s)]
*  I think they got taken down again on YouTube I think, yeah [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2221.0s)]
*  I don't know if you mean like their website and everything? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2224.0s)]
*  No, their YouTube page [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2226.0s)]
*  Yeah, they got taken down again, yeah [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2227.0s)]
*  There's one video where this comic that works with Lewis [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2229.0s)]
*  Was saying that all they were doing in this podcast [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2233.0s)]
*  Is talking about how big a guy's dick was [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2236.0s)]
*  This guy had a giant hog [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2239.0s)]
*  They were talking about this guy [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2240.0s)]
*  And they got their shit removed for that [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2241.0s)]
*  It's up now [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2244.0s)]
*  It's back [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2246.0s)]
*  Unless it's a different page [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2247.0s)]
*  So it's back [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2248.0s)]
*  The specials and stuff [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2249.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2250.0s)]
*  So what were they saying? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2251.0s)]
*  Oh, is it [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2252.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm looking at something [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2253.0s)]
*  Maybe it was a clip of something that happened in the past [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2254.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know the specifics of it at all [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2257.0s)]
*  It was one of those [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2259.0s)]
*  It was either an Instagram reel or one of them YouTube shorts [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2261.0s)]
*  You know, one of those things like that [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2264.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2265.0s)]
*  He was talking about how they took it down [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2266.0s)]
*  Because he was talking about how big a dude's hog was [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2268.0s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't seem [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2270.0s)]
*  Oh, it's bullying [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2271.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2272.0s)]
*  Even his big dick [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2273.0s)]
*  You're talking about Jeffrey Epstein's Island [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2274.0s)]
*  A lot of people don't talk about his ranch in New Mexico [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2276.0s)]
*  Yeah, and his mansion [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2278.0s)]
*  I mean it was popping off at all his spots [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2280.0s)]
*  He built a 26,700 square foot mansion with a sprawling courtyard and a living room [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2282.0s)]
*  Roughly the size of the American home [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2288.0s)]
*  Nearby was a private airstrip with a hanger and helipad [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2290.0s)]
*  The property also included a ranch office, a firehouse, and a seven bay heated garage [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2294.0s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds like an intelligence agent [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2300.0s)]
*  Right out of a fucking movie [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2303.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we're never [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2305.0s)]
*  Luring all the politicians into the honeypot [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2306.0s)]
*  And how many people died because of that? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2308.0s)]
*  We're never going to know [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2311.0s)]
*  They're never going to let us [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2313.0s)]
*  We'll never know [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2314.0s)]
*  What a fucking genius con [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2315.0s)]
*  What a genius con [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2318.0s)]
*  You get some guy, he says he's a billionaire [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2320.0s)]
*  You just give him like a fucking blank checkbook [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2322.0s)]
*  Which, when you're spending 170 billion on Ukraine [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2324.0s)]
*  And 136 billion here [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2328.0s)]
*  And 46 billion there [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2330.0s)]
*  We got to upgrade that [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2332.0s)]
*  And just let these people in [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2333.0s)]
*  And that costs 30 trillion [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2334.0s)]
*  Like fucking [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2336.0s)]
*  What's a billion? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2337.0s)]
*  That's right, yeah [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2338.0s)]
*  What's a billion to control literally the greatest scientists and entertainers and politicians [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2339.0s)]
*  And just get them all convinced [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2345.0s)]

*  Look how beautiful these women are [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2358.0s)]
*  It's like everybody says that [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2361.0s)]
*  If you went there, you'd be a real piece of shit [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2363.0s)]
*  If you're going to a place where [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2365.0s)]
*  I mean, what is the actual list? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2368.0s)]
*  Who's on the actual list? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2371.0s)]
*  There's some pretty fascinating people [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2374.0s)]
*  If you got invited to that party [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2377.0s)]
*  You didn't know what the fuck was going on [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2379.0s)]
*  Magician David Copperfield reappears [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2380.0s)]
*  And Jeffrey Epstein Court, poof, reappears [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2382.0s)]
*  With lawyers suggesting he traded tickets for girls [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2386.0s)]
*  Tickets for his shows? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2390.0s)]
*  Is his show that hot? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2391.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, how cheap are these girls? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2393.0s)]
*  Because how much do these tickets to his show cost? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2396.0s)]
*  I don't know the magic hierarchy [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2398.0s)]
*  Talk about overvaluing what you're worth [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2401.0s)]
*  If you give me a sex slave, I'll give you tickets to my show [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2405.0s)]
*  I'll give you tickets to my magic show [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2407.0s)]
*  Not even a Chris Angel show either [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2409.0s)]
*  But what a brilliant move [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2411.0s)]
*  If you can [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2413.0s)]
*  I mean, here's question number one [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2416.0s)]
*  Were they all underage? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2418.0s)]
*  Were some of them of age? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2420.0s)]
*  Do we know how that worked? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2422.0s)]
*  Because even if they weren't underage [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2424.0s)]
*  It's the best [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2426.0s)]
*  If you want to get some blackmail [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2427.0s)]
*  That's the best [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2428.0s)]
*  But you still bust quite a few guys with of age [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2429.0s)]
*  Especially if you're giving them a little yay-o [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2432.0s)]
*  We're on an island [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2435.0s)]
*  You ain't got to do no yay-o [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2437.0s)]
*  There's no rules [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2438.0s)]
*  We're the elites [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2439.0s)]
*  We're the fucking Illuminati, pooh [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2441.0s)]
*  Yeah, just cheating on your wife is enough [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2445.0s)]
*  Enough, that's enough [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2447.0s)]
*  We're publicly having it so that they can trot it out there [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2448.0s)]
*  Anytime there's an election [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2453.0s)]
*  Anytime there's this or there's a vote [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2455.0s)]
*  They want you to vote in one way or another way [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2458.0s)]
*  They always have that, always have that [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2460.0s)]
*  Just a little reminder out there [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2462.0s)]
*  You just keep that fucking thing in the back of your head [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2463.0s)]
*  Like I gotta shut the fuck up and toe the line [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2465.0s)]
*  I gotta shut the fuck up and toe the line [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2467.0s)]
*  There's no better way to control someone [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2469.0s)]
*  No better way [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2471.0s)]
*  And it's so brilliant and ancient [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2472.0s)]
*  It's like an ancient strategy [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2476.0s)]
*  You know, and it was [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2478.0s)]
*  First of all, is there another one going on right now [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2481.0s)]
*  That we don't know about? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2483.0s)]
*  Of course [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2484.0s)]
*  Like that, at that level? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2485.0s)]
*  Of course [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2486.0s)]
*  It seems like that guy was like [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2487.0s)]
*  So effective, why would you stop? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2488.0s)]
*  I think you need a combination of things to do it at that guy's level [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2489.0s)]
*  By all accounts, he was a brilliant guy [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2493.0s)]
*  Which is wild, right? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2497.0s)]
*  And you have to be also a sick fuck [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2498.0s)]
*  Which he obviously was [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2502.0s)]
*  And also an intelligence agent [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2503.0s)]
*  So do you just become that sick fuck over the course of [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2507.0s)]
*  Like you know, you hear about DEA agents [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2512.0s)]
*  They start dealing drugs [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2514.0s)]
*  Once they get in there, they're like undercover [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2515.0s)]
*  And then they fucking live the life [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2519.0s)]
*  And they start actually dealing drugs [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2520.0s)]
*  It happens [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2522.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2523.0s)]
*  Do you think like maybe the guy just became a fucking sociopath, psychopath [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2524.0s)]
*  So fascinating [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2528.0s)]
*  From just dealing with the life that he was [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2529.0s)]
*  That's his job [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2531.0s)]
*  His job is to trick politicians into fucking underage girls [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2532.0s)]
*  And get them coked up and bring them into this place [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2536.0s)]
*  With cameras everywhere [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2539.0s)]
*  These fucking idiots don't know that there's going to be cameras everywhere [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2540.0s)]
*  And you set this up? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2544.0s)]
*  And this is what you do for a living for 30 years? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2545.0s)]
*  Or however long you did it? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2548.0s)]
*  It's fascinating to think about [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2549.0s)]
*  I think two things [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2550.0s)]
*  I think everyone wants to be someone, right? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2551.0s)]
*  Everyone wants to be someone, have an exciting life [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2555.0s)]
*  And then I think people have a myriad of [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2559.0s)]
*  They have a, you know, just your moral compass [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2563.0s)]
*  From your family, whatever's on a scale [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2567.0s)]
*  So that's a factor [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2569.0s)]
*  And then, but the more important factor is [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2570.0s)]
*  Everyone has those moments in their life where things are offered to them [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2572.0s)]
*  You know, and you know, you go this way [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2575.0s)]
*  You're going to get some exciting stuff [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2578.0s)]
*  But you're going to have to compromise your moral compass [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2581.0s)]
*  And people make that decision [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2583.0s)]
*  Fame and power, it's like the ultimate elixir [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2586.0s)]
*  It's also the people that you're around [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2591.0s)]
*  Because like we were talking about, like we love being around comics [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2593.0s)]
*  It's fun, it's our lifestyle, it's how we like to talk [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2596.0s)]
*  They like being around other sociopaths [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2600.0s)]
*  They like being around other people that are taking over businesses [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2603.0s)]
*  Hostile takeovers [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2607.0s)]
*  They like to be around the guys who influence foreign governments [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2609.0s)]
*  The guys who fly over in private jets [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2613.0s)]
*  And sit with their legs crossed with Italian shoes on [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2615.0s)]
*  You know, and they have conversations about clean energy [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2619.0s)]
*  And you know, what they really want to do is control the fucking food [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2624.0s)]
*  Control the farmlands [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2627.0s)]
*  You know, we have to reduce the methane from these cows [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2629.0s)]
*  And the best way to do it is just take the cows away from the farmers [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2632.0s)]
*  If we just control the cows [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2636.0s)]
*  If we have a climate change mandate and we control the farms [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2638.0s)]
*  I mean, it's basically game over [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2641.0s)]
*  They're literally doing that [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2643.0s)]
*  All bad guys have a British accent [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2645.0s)]
*  There's no reason why you would say we shouldn't have cows [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2647.0s)]
*  Unless you're a fucking complete sociopath [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2651.0s)]
*  You're not going after the coal plants first [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2654.0s)]
*  No, you want people to get rid of cows [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2657.0s)]
*  Are you sure this is a good strategy? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2659.0s)]
*  Do you understand starvation? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2662.0s)]
*  Do you understand how that works? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2665.0s)]
*  You're not going to grow cows, are you? [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2667.0s)]
*  No, you need someone to grow cows [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2669.0s)]
*  You're going to take their cows away? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2671.0s)]
*  The fuck out of here [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2673.0s)]
*  Yeah, why would they want to get rid of cows? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2675.0s)]
*  Because they want you to be completely dependent on them [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2677.0s)]
*  The more you're dependent on them [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2681.0s)]
*  And the more they can tell you what's good and what's bad [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2683.0s)]
*  And what you shouldn't be doing [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2686.0s)]
*  And Janis, we looked at your carbon footprint [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2688.0s)]
*  Your carbon footprint is very problematic [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2690.0s)]
*  It seems like in your job of stand-up comedy [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2693.0s)]
*  You travel more than the average person [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2695.0s)]
*  And you contribute more CO2 [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2697.0s)]
*  And they show you a video of all [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2699.0s)]
*  And we're going to have to get you to stop [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2701.0s)]
*  It's like for the greater good [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2704.0s)]
*  For the greater good [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2706.0s)]
*  It has some benefits [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2708.0s)]
*  Social credit scores have a benefit [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2710.0s)]
*  Things are cleaner [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2712.0s)]
*  They run a little more orderly [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2713.0s)]
*  Sure, you have to listen or you can't eat [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2715.0s)]
*  It's horrible, it's a nightmare [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2717.0s)]
*  But there is some... [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2719.0s)]
*  Things do run better [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2721.0s)]
*  Well, it runs better for the government [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2723.0s)]
*  Yeah, you have less dissent because you kill people [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2725.0s)]
*  China is doing a great job of showing how you can run it [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2727.0s)]
*  You can run it, yeah, they're just doing it [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2730.0s)]
*  It's a nice tight ship over there [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2732.0s)]
*  Nobody's jaywalking [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2734.0s)]
*  That's how you make an iPhone [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2735.0s)]
*  That's how you make an iPhone over there [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2737.0s)]
*  You get people to follow rules [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2739.0s)]
*  If that comes over here [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2741.0s)]
*  That's the end of creativity [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2743.0s)]
*  That's the end of everything [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2745.0s)]
*  Because you're just going to have to shut the fuck up [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2747.0s)]
*  You're going to have to tow the line [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2749.0s)]
*  And we already know that the line is nonsense [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2751.0s)]
*  We know that the line is not really intelligent people [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2753.0s)]
*  That are assessing objectively what's going on in the world [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2756.0s)]
*  And giving you a reasonable version of the events [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2760.0s)]
*  We know that's not really what we're seeing in the media [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2764.0s)]
*  We're seeing people that are deeply influenced by advertising budgets [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2768.0s)]
*  By what kind of companies advertise on their shows [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2773.0s)]
*  By the investors who own stock in the company [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2777.0s)]
*  There's narratives [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2781.0s)]
*  And they're not necessarily even remotely honest [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2783.0s)]
*  Sometimes they're off the charts fake [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2787.0s)]
*  Right [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2791.0s)]
*  And they get printed in major newspapers [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2793.0s)]
*  Some of the propaganda in the beginning of the Israeli Hamas war [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2796.0s)]
*  Was that the Israelis bombed a hospital and 500 people were killed [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2802.0s)]
*  It was printed in the New York Times [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2806.0s)]
*  They didn't hit the hospital [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2808.0s)]
*  They hit the parking lot next to the hospital [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2810.0s)]
*  A lot of that is the rush to get to the story first [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2812.0s)]
*  Because there's so much competition [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2814.0s)]
*  Everyone's just putting things out [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2816.0s)]
*  Nobody cares about the retraction anyway [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2818.0s)]
*  Also, that's a juicy story [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2820.0s)]
*  If Israel really did bomb a hospital [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2823.0s)]
*  Oh my god, this is genocide [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2825.0s)]
*  It really helps that narrative [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2827.0s)]
*  I was watching this documentary last night [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2829.0s)]
*  And the media did that to this couple [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2831.0s)]
*  Because the movie Gone Girl was out at the time [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2833.0s)]
*  So they just started calling her Gone Girl [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2836.0s)]
*  And she made up this whole story of being kidnapped [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2838.0s)]
*  She did get kidnapped [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2840.0s)]
*  She did get raped [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2841.0s)]
*  But the media was just making fun of her [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2842.0s)]
*  Calling her Gone Girl [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2844.0s)]
*  Because it's a juicier story [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2845.0s)]
*  They just ran with it [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2847.0s)]
*  The police department too was all convinced that she was a Gone Girl [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2849.0s)]
*  People just marketing and advertising and subterfuge [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2852.0s)]
*  It works [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2858.0s)]
*  It just works [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2859.0s)]
*  That's why advertisers spend billions of dollars on it [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2860.0s)]
*  Because it works [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2862.0s)]
*  You ever see Nancy Pelosi talking about it? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2863.0s)]
*  Openly [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2864.0s)]
*  Talk about the wrap-up smear [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2865.0s)]
*  No [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2867.0s)]
*  Nancy's been in politics for a long time [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2868.0s)]
*  She's been along [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2870.0s)]
*  And she's a genius with her money [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2871.0s)]
*  She's very good [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2873.0s)]
*  She beats the market a lot [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2874.0s)]
*  It's amazing that someone who's never made more than $170,000 a year is worth $150 million [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2875.0s)]
*  And she does better investing in the stock market than Warren Buffett or George Soros [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2881.0s)]
*  Yeah, she's always beaten the market [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2885.0s)]
*  So I don't know what happened [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2887.0s)]
*  Maybe she had a senior moment [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2888.0s)]
*  And she just started explaining how you lie [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2889.0s)]
*  I mean, this can't be AI, is it? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2892.0s)]
*  I think it's real [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2895.0s)]
*  Because it's from a couple of years ago [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2896.0s)]
*  It's called the wrap-up smear [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2897.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's an AP assessment that says it's been taken out of context [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2898.0s)]
*  I was trying to get to what the context was [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2904.0s)]
*  What context could it be? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2906.0s)]
*  She's describing a wrap-up smear [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2907.0s)]
*  The assessment says she was describing a tactic she accused Republicans of against Democrats [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2910.0s)]
*  And other portions of her response not shown in the clip [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2917.0s)]
*  Pelosi makes it clear she is not talking about her own party [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2920.0s)]
*  Oh, I don't necessarily think she's talking about anyone in particular [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2922.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is that what she revealed is that it's a play [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2926.0s)]
*  If you're a football player and they call a play, you know that play [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2931.0s)]
*  Like her callback in stand-up comedy [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2936.0s)]
*  This is what she's doing [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2939.0s)]
*  She's talking business [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2940.0s)]
*  She's talking business [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2941.0s)]
*  I'm not saying she's even accusing anybody of this [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2942.0s)]
*  No, I know, the claim was that it was [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2944.0s)]
*  The claim was saying that it's how the Democrats get the media to legitimize lies [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2945.0s)]
*  Okay, but what was fascinating to me about it was just this open admittance that it's all bullshit [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2949.0s)]
*  Just saying, not decrying this thing and saying it's a genuine problem with communication [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2957.0s)]
*  That we have deception and it's tolerated and that it's not punished [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2964.0s)]
*  Willful deception like this [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2968.0s)]
*  And there's a thing called a wrap-up smear [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2971.0s)]
*  And this is a horrible thing that they do [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2972.0s)]
*  It wasn't that [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2974.0s)]
*  It was like, this is how it's done [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2975.0s)]
*  Watch it, go play from the beginning [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2977.0s)]
*  Video, I think [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2979.0s)]
*  You smear somebody with falsehoods and all the rest [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2985.0s)]
*  And then you merchandise it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2990.0s)]
*  And then you write it [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2992.0s)]
*  And they'll say, see, it's reported in the press that this, this, this, and this [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2993.0s)]
*  So they have that validation [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=2998.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3002.0s)]
*  The news person's about to start talking [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3003.0s)]
*  That's why I was trying to cut it off [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3004.0s)]
*  The assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3005.0s)]
*  This is where I was trying to not get too confused on what [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3008.0s)]
*  Okay, so they were connecting it to the assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3010.0s)]
*  To try to keep him out of the Supreme Court, right? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3014.0s)]
*  Is that what the Fox News story was trying to do? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3016.0s)]
*  Five years ago when this was posted [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3019.0s)]
*  Yeah, but what I was getting at was just that she's describing a tactic [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3020.0s)]
*  This is what we do [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3025.0s)]
*  You know, we fake [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3026.0s)]
*  And then Johnny comes in to the right [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3028.0s)]
*  I pass off the football to him [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3030.0s)]
*  He sneaks around behind me [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3032.0s)]
*  We run through the fucking line [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3034.0s)]
*  Let's go [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3036.0s)]
*  She's talking business [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3037.0s)]
*  Even if she's not saying that the Democrats do it [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3039.0s)]
*  This is how we do it [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3042.0s)]
*  She's talking business [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3043.0s)]
*  Yes, yes [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3044.0s)]
*  And that's how it works [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3045.0s)]
*  She's not horrified [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3046.0s)]
*  Imagine if you were in that same position [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3047.0s)]
*  And you had been given information [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3050.0s)]
*  For whatever reason [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3051.0s)]
*  The current administration thinks Yannis Papas [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3052.0s)]
*  Let's have a very smart, funny guy [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3055.0s)]
*  And he's going to be the guy that kind of explains what's going on [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3057.0s)]
*  And you have to explain what a wrap-up smear is [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3060.0s)]
*  Would you not feel morally obligated to say something about how atrocious activity like this is [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3063.0s)]
*  When it comes to critical decisions that people are making [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3071.0s)]
*  People that are probably not that informed [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3075.0s)]
*  People that are going through their day busy [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3078.0s)]
*  They have jobs [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3080.0s)]
*  They have bills [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3081.0s)]
*  They have stress [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3082.0s)]
*  They have all kinds of stuff going on [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3083.0s)]
*  They don't have enough time to pay attention to what's going on with that Supreme Court guy [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3084.0s)]
*  So if you're openly discussing strategies [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3090.0s)]
*  Where you would deceive people in order to get a narrative pass [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3095.0s)]
*  That's clearly untrue [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3099.0s)]
*  Because you don't want that guy in office politically [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3101.0s)]
*  And that's not horrific to people [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3104.0s)]
*  That is anti-American [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3107.0s)]
*  It really is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3109.0s)]
*  And you can think you're doing it because you're a good American [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3110.0s)]
*  But that's how communism gets started [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3113.0s)]
*  That's how dictators take over [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3116.0s)]
*  They come up with justification for why they can bend the rules [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3118.0s)]
*  The rules are the fucking rules [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3122.0s)]
*  Yeah, once you compromise the rules [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3125.0s)]
*  You gotta let people vote [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3128.0s)]
*  There should be, and I think there's gotta be a good news [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3130.0s)]
*  What is that 1440 news? Is that what it's called? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3135.0s)]
*  I don't even know what that is [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3138.0s)]
*  There's some news site that is, I think that's the name of it [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3139.0s)]
*  I signed up for it [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3144.0s)]
*  I don't even remember what it is [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3145.0s)]
*  They're trying to just give you facts with no narrative [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3146.0s)]
*  Like here's the events of the day [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3151.0s)]
*  Ground news? I love ground news [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3153.0s)]
*  I don't know what the sources are, like if they're on the ground [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3156.0s)]
*  But what they're doing is they're trying to do it without a left wing or a right wing spin [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3158.0s)]
*  Well ground news tells you it rates [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3163.0s)]
*  That's it, 1440? [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3165.0s)]
*  I don't know, is it? [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3166.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3167.0s)]
*  Do you have to sign up for it? [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3168.0s)]
*  I don't even know [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3170.0s)]
*  I can't tell if this is just a substation [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3171.0s)]
*  100 plus sources so you don't have to, culture, science, sports, politics, business and more [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3173.0s)]
*  All in a five minute read [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3177.0s)]
*  People are, if you're a Fox News fucking zombie [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3179.0s)]
*  You're a Fox News zombie [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3184.0s)]
*  You're not checking what MSNBC has to say [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3185.0s)]
*  What's that Rachel Maddow lady? What's her take on this? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3190.0s)]
*  Is there some fucking, is there room in the middle here? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3194.0s)]
*  You don't want to live in that reality [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3197.0s)]
*  You live in the Fox reality [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3199.0s)]
*  You don't have any time [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3200.0s)]
*  No one has any fucking time, you know [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3201.0s)]
*  They don't have time to be sorting this out [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3204.0s)]
*  So if you're fucking lying [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3206.0s)]
*  And you're doing it because you think it's a good strategy to get your politician in place [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3210.0s)]
*  That's dirty, that's anti-American [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3217.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is, but I'm sure it's the way it's worked from the beginning [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3220.0s)]
*  Think about what they took Nixon out for [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3225.0s)]
*  Just spying, just a little spying [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3228.0s)]
*  Just a little spying, not that big a deal [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3233.0s)]
*  And they don't want to do anything about the Epstein client list [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3236.0s)]
*  And they don't want to do anything about whatever the fuck Hunter Biden was doing with Russia and Ukraine and China [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3241.0s)]
*  What were you doing bro? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3252.0s)]
*  They're selective about what they can take [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3254.0s)]
*  What were you doing over there? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3256.0s)]
*  Hey Joe, why does everybody have millions of dollars? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3257.0s)]
*  Where did all that come from? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3260.0s)]
*  Why are you on the board of a major energy company and you're a crackhead? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3261.0s)]
*  Is it to curry favor with the vice president? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3267.0s)]
*  Why did Joe Biden get a million dollar a year job teaching at UPenn that was funded by a Chinese grant? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3270.0s)]
*  Or it shouldn't say it's funded by a Chinese grant [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3280.0s)]
*  It happened right after China gave him a bunch of money [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3285.0s)]
*  This fucking dude doesn't even have to show their news teller when he's teaching there [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3289.0s)]
*  And he also plagiarized, got caught and there's no consequences [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3293.0s)]
*  Dude, we had Joe Biden night at Stitch's Comedy Club in Boston in 1988 when he was running for president [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3297.0s)]
*  He got busted, I think it was Robert Kennedy's speech and someone else's speech [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3305.0s)]
*  He used like big chunks of people's stuff and he got busted pre-internet [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3310.0s)]
*  And it was so egregious and so bad that we did Joe Biden night at Stitch's Comedy Club [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3314.0s)]
*  Like you would go up and do my act and I would go up and do your act [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3320.0s)]
*  We would just go up and do acts of our friends [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3324.0s)]
*  You know, we'd sit at, Fitzsimmons and I used to go and watch it [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3328.0s)]
*  It was hilarious [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3333.0s)]
*  There's no consequences [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3335.0s)]
*  There's no consequences [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3337.0s)]
*  It's not just no consequences but there's so many videos of him [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3338.0s)]
*  People keep wanting to talk about Trump lying and Trump being a bully [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3342.0s)]
*  I'm not saying he's not [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3346.0s)]
*  I'm not saying he's not a crazy individual, a bombastic individual [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3348.0s)]
*  But why are you ignoring the other guy's lies? [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3352.0s)]
*  Because if you care about truth we should be going, shit, look at this mess [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3356.0s)]
*  That's what we should be doing [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3360.0s)]
*  It's the same reason why those people won't say that Trump did anything good [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3361.0s)]
*  He did do some good things when he was in office [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3365.0s)]
*  He was right about some things and he did do some things that were effective [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3367.0s)]
*  But they'll never admit it because it's all team ball [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3371.0s)]
*  The guy who was the head of Google, how do you say his name? Chamoff? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3374.0s)]
*  I don't want to fuck his name up [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3378.0s)]
*  Brilliant guy [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3380.0s)]
*  But his take on it was [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3381.0s)]
*  Trump was the wrong guy with the right strategies [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3384.0s)]
*  Wrong guy with the right message [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3387.0s)]
*  Wrong guy socially, politically, lightning rod for the wrong kind of people [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3389.0s)]
*  The right guy in terms of, seems like those policies were more effective [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3395.0s)]
*  There's just so many things that are fucking weird right now [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3400.0s)]
*  That's a good point [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3403.0s)]
*  That is a good point, yeah [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3404.0s)]
*  Well he's brilliant [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3405.0s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy and you have to be brilliant to be someone who was at Google [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3406.0s)]
*  Which is an incredibly left wing organization [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3411.0s)]
*  Like heavy, like most super genius tech people are very left wing [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3414.0s)]
*  And then to look at that in a nuanced way [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3419.0s)]
*  And to be able to step outside of the ideology and say that [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3422.0s)]
*  Because that's the truth, that is the truth [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3425.0s)]
*  He was an early executive of Facebook [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3428.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Facebook [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3430.0s)]
*  And again, same kind of thing [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3432.0s)]
*  Same idea [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3434.0s)]
*  Yeah, super genius tech guy [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3435.0s)]
*  But the way he describes it, see if you can find him saying it [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3437.0s)]
*  Because the way he describes it, you're like, thank God he's saying that and not a moron [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3441.0s)]
*  Because what he's describing is the actual points and he's making very good points about it [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3446.0s)]
*  Well, I mean we're less dependent on foreign oil [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3451.0s)]
*  I mean he was right about the border, look at the border now [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3454.0s)]
*  The border now seems to be on purpose [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3457.0s)]
*  It seems to be on purpose [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3459.0s)]
*  It seems to be that there's some sort of a strategy to either flood the country [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3461.0s)]
*  Tim Dillon thinks it's cheap labor for construction [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3466.0s)]
*  He's like [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3471.0s)]
*  That's gotta be true [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3472.0s)]
*  It's gotta be a factor, it's gotta be a factor [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3473.0s)]
*  Cheap labor is probably a factor [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3475.0s)]
*  And then another factor is this push to have them be able to vote [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3477.0s)]
*  You know, it's a weird one [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3482.0s)]
*  It's a weird one, like they're doing that in New York City [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3485.0s)]
*  They're pushing to give illegals the right to vote [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3487.0s)]
*  But then the wildest thing that Texas is doing is just shipping all the people that show up [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3489.0s)]
*  Because these states want, they want sanctuary cities [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3494.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, because you're not on the border [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3497.0s)]
*  Okay, we'll just ship them to you [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3499.0s)]
*  So Texas is just shipping busloads of illegal immigrants to New York [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3501.0s)]
*  Like, this is your mess [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3505.0s)]
*  It's the perfect example of the difference between theory and reality [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3506.0s)]
*  It's like everyone up there is in theory [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3510.0s)]
*  Oh, love everybody, everyone's great [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3512.0s)]
*  There's no such thing as an illegal [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3514.0s)]
*  And then when it becomes your problem, and that's why Texas is doing it [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3516.0s)]
*  They're going, okay, now you're gonna deal with what we're dealing with [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3519.0s)]
*  So you're gonna feel what it's like [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3521.0s)]
*  And now you guys gotta pay for it [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3522.0s)]
*  And you have to figure out what to do [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3523.0s)]
*  Change your policies [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3525.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's, it has, there's a lot of people in the left and the center that are going just like, make it go away [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3526.0s)]
*  They're just going, I don't know, just throw them in the water [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3534.0s)]
*  Just make it go away, but don't tell anyone I told you [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3536.0s)]
*  Is this it? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3538.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3539.0s)]
*  Talk about Trump derangement syndrome [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3540.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3542.0s)]
*  Okay, let's go to that, let's make a restart [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3543.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, I voted for Joe Biden [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3550.0s)]
*  But this is the honest assessment [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3552.0s)]
*  The guy did, for the things that he was supposed to do, a good job [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3554.0s)]
*  And for where every other president found a way to, frankly, make our situation a little bit worse [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3558.0s)]
*  Specifically around wars, he did not do that [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3565.0s)]
*  And that is a huge accomplishment that I think needs to be acknowledged [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3567.0s)]
*  As a Democrat who has been left homeless, who is now definitely in the center, but probably leaning increasingly right [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3571.0s)]
*  I'm left yet again with an appreciation, despite the messenger of the message of the Trump administration [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3581.0s)]
*  Because what those guys did was pretty incredible in hindsight [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3588.0s)]
*  These Abraham Accords, the Accords with Israel and the GCC, the almost accord between Israel and Saudi [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3593.0s)]
*  To really be able to find a long lasting peace is just a real example for the world [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3600.0s)]
*  And those guys did a lot of really good work [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3609.0s)]
*  It's a miracle actually when you look at it, what they did, despite the fact, listen, I'm no fan of Trump and I am too homeless [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3613.0s)]
*  But this is where, if you want to objectively look at what they did, it was good work [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3621.0s)]
*  You have to, you have to [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3626.0s)]
*  And in fact, this is a moment where you have to start to re-underwrite [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3628.0s)]
*  Is one's Trump derangement syndrome causing more damage than anything that Trump could have actually done? [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3632.0s)]
*  And I think the answer is yes, because it's now causing us to not see that good work and then embrace and extend it [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3638.0s)]
*  So much of the work that happened in that administration turns out to have been right [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3647.0s)]
*  And that's what's so frustrating for me [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3654.0s)]
*  The work on the border wall, we didn't like the messenger, so we killed the message [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3657.0s)]
*  Turned out it was right [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3661.0s)]
*  Issuing long term debt to refinance when rates were at zero, we didn't like the messenger, so we killed the message [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3663.0s)]
*  A structural peace in the Middle East, we didn't like the messenger, so we killed the message [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3670.0s)]
*  When are we going to stop shooting ourselves in the foot? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3675.0s)]
*  And when are we going to actually see and take the time to look past who was saying things and actually listen to them word for word? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3678.0s)]
*  Boom [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3686.0s)]
*  So good [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3688.0s)]
*  Well that's why he's going to win this election, if they let him run, he's going to win [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3689.0s)]
*  Well, I think the abortion thing really shot the Republicans in the foot [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3692.0s)]
*  I think a lot of women are not happy about that, whether they publicly say it or not [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3695.0s)]
*  I think it's a gamble [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3700.0s)]
*  It's like what percentage of people are pro and what percentage of people are against [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3702.0s)]
*  And how many of the people that are actually going to vote, the real hardcore, you know, read till I'm dead [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3706.0s)]
*  How many of those people are pro-life? Probably a good number [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3714.0s)]
*  And the other ones are, the other ones are not going to vote Democrat just for that issue [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3719.0s)]
*  If you don't, like, I believe with Trump with everything, except killing babies, I'm not going to vote for him on that [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3725.0s)]
*  I just think you should be able to do that [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3731.0s)]
*  Very few people are going to do that, unless you currently need one right now [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3733.0s)]
*  You know, that might sway your judgment [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3737.0s)]
*  Very few people, if like most of the chips are stacked in this one direction but there's just one [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3740.0s)]
*  The thing about it is the control thing [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3745.0s)]
*  The thing about it that is kind of crazy is being able to tell someone what they can and can't do [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3749.0s)]
*  And to say there's no debate [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3754.0s)]
*  Well it's clearly a debate because people have been having abortions all over the place and we're not putting them in jail [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3756.0s)]
*  So there's clearly a debate as to what that is [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3761.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also that it's one of those things where it's like you're morally against it [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3764.0s)]
*  So then if you're morally against it, then you don't do it and be morally against it [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3768.0s)]
*  But it's one of those things that's going to happen [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3772.0s)]
*  It's like being morally against something doesn't change anything in the real world [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3774.0s)]
*  Say like with Israel and Palestine, I'm morally against it [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3779.0s)]
*  It's like, okay, what's that going to do? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3782.0s)]
*  It's not going to stop people from dying [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3784.0s)]
*  To an extent, to an extent [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3786.0s)]
*  Because once the baby's born, then we all agree you can't kill it [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3788.0s)]
*  Right [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3790.0s)]
*  But that's so there's a number [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3791.0s)]
*  But most of the world does like what? First term, after first term is not good [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3792.0s)]
*  There's got to be a compromise [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3797.0s)]
*  It's interesting because people are talking about you [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3799.0s)]
*  Because abortions aren't good, even if you're on the left, abortions, you can't say abortions are good [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3801.0s)]
*  When the people that want them are, you know, like, you see the video of that trans guy, or trans woman rather [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3804.0s)]
*  Who said he wants to be the first person to get a transplanted uterus, get pregnant and have an abortion [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3811.0s)]
*  It's got to be a joke, it's good [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3816.0s)]
*  You can't add comedy to comedy [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3818.0s)]
*  It's probably a dude [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3820.0s)]
*  It's probably just a regular dude, just thought it would be funny, start a TikTok page, say the wildest shit [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3821.0s)]
*  And then you're going for your kids [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3826.0s)]
*  I always think that about the guy with the stubble and the lipstick, I'm like that's probably not even real [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3827.0s)]
*  This one [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3830.0s)]
*  But because they want to get an abortion [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3831.0s)]
*  Trans woman to have a successful uterus transplant, ovaries and eggs included [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3834.0s)]
*  And I want to be the first trans woman to have an abortion [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3841.0s)]
*  If this is true, it's comedy, if it's not, it's also comedy [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3847.0s)]
*  It's China's victory cry [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3852.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got them [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3854.0s)]
*  That's what I think, I think China TikToked us into a fucking coma [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3856.0s)]
*  They certainly have, yeah [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3861.0s)]
*  I think we did it to ourselves partially, but I also think for sure, just like I said, like it has an effect on narratives [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3863.0s)]
*  About which way people believe, what they agree with and don't agree with [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3871.0s)]
*  Whatever they can show you on that algorithm, that shapes things in a certain direction [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3875.0s)]
*  Well, I think they saw what our culture is about, what our weakness was, and they used it against us [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3880.0s)]
*  You know, fame, what we worship, Tom Cruise, fame [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3886.0s)]
*  And then once they democratized fame, they were like, oh, let's use this [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3889.0s)]
*  Let's promote, let's make stupid people famous [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3893.0s)]
*  Let's make simple things famous, let's push these in the algorithm [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3897.0s)]
*  So people see it because then Americans will go, oh, I can get famous too [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3901.0s)]
*  And then everyone started becoming their own Madison Avenue agency, marketing wacky, zany versions of themselves [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3905.0s)]
*  If you know actors, and you know actors, and I know actors, not all of them [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3913.0s)]
*  But there's a percentage of them that aren't even people [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3918.0s)]
*  No, they're like vessels [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3921.0s)]
*  They're out of their fucking mind [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3923.0s)]
*  And if you can convince that guy that wearing a dress to the Golden Globes is going to get him more attention, he's going to do it [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3925.0s)]
*  He's going to do it [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3933.0s)]
*  He's going to wear high heels, and you're going to tell him he looks fabulous, and this guy is straight as an arrow [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3935.0s)]
*  And it doesn't matter, he's just gaming the system [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3939.0s)]
*  The people who are really into fame, you can really convince them to do anything [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3943.0s)]
*  Because they want the fame, they want the attention, they want it bad, they want it so bad [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3947.0s)]
*  That's the question [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3952.0s)]
*  They want it so bad, they're obsessed with being huge [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3953.0s)]
*  And I've met people like that, they're just, they're obsessed with it [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3956.0s)]
*  That's what they want, it's just what they want, it's how they're built, it's what they're into [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3961.0s)]
*  And then the producer puts his hand on your leg and grabs your hog [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3965.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, but I want the movie [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3968.0s)]
*  And you do it [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3971.0s)]
*  The movie's so important [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3972.0s)]
*  And you do it [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3973.0s)]
*  The movie's so important [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3974.0s)]
*  He grabs you by your hand, takes you into the room [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3975.0s)]
*  Oh, Yannis [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3978.0s)]
*  How bad do you want to be Iron Man? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3980.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3982.0s)]
*  How bad? [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3983.0s)]
*  How bad? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3984.0s)]
*  How bad do you want to be Peter Parker? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3985.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3987.0s)]
*  It's so crazy [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3989.0s)]
*  That's probably what tips and scales, whoever's willing to do that the most [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3991.0s)]
*  Well, Quentin Tarantino was telling us about this old director that literally had a bedroom built into his office [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=3994.0s)]
*  Where he had bed the starlets [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4000.0s)]
*  So he had his office, they'd go into his office and there was a bed in a room [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4002.0s)]
*  And he'd take them in there and bang them, all of them [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4006.0s)]
*  You want to be in the movie? You've got to fuck the producer [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4008.0s)]
*  Fuck the producer, yeah [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4011.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4012.0s)]
*  Especially once you get that system up and running [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4013.0s)]
*  And you've created a few stars and you know how to do it [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4015.0s)]
*  And they'll go, it's Frank, he's the guy who runs the office [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4018.0s)]
*  He can make you famous [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4022.0s)]
*  And he can [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4023.0s)]
*  And he can [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4024.0s)]
*  And he can and he will [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4025.0s)]
*  And he can [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4026.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4027.0s)]
*  It's interesting now because the world knows that that's the way it works [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4028.0s)]
*  Because it does, it does work that way [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4031.0s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein thing, just opened up that candle worm [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4033.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just opened it up [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4035.0s)]
*  It's like, that is how it works [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4036.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4037.0s)]
*  That is how it works [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4038.0s)]
*  A lot of times people who rise up in the system are bad people [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4039.0s)]
*  Especially those kind of systems [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4044.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4045.0s)]
*  Systems of power and influence [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4046.0s)]
*  But I would say that that's like, I was always talking about Hollywood in that way [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4047.0s)]
*  That that is like, it's a perfect proving ground for like the absolute worst way to develop a human being [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4051.0s)]
*  You take people that are already fucked up and they need extra attention [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4059.0s)]
*  And then they move to a place where they're surrounded by people who are fucked up and need extra attention [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4063.0s)]
*  And then you make them compete to see who's worthy [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4070.0s)]
*  And you go in there and pretend to be someone else and they decide whether or not they like your someone else or his someone else [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4073.0s)]
*  And you have to figure out what they like and try to be their friend [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4079.0s)]
*  Maybe bring them chocolates and maybe talk to them about the latest Roe v. Wade issue [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4082.0s)]
*  I, for one, have always been with the woman's right to choose [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4087.0s)]
*  And they like formulate their ideology based on whatever this group of people [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4090.0s)]
*  So this group of people achieves ultimate power [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4095.0s)]
*  And you know, like, if you step out of line politically with any of those people, you're on that shit list [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4098.0s)]
*  And you're not going to be in that movie 100% [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4105.0s)]
*  You either keep your fucking mouth shut or you go and you wear your fucking pink ribbon [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4107.0s)]
*  And you do all the things you're supposed to do, the black square on Tuesday [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4113.0s)]
*  You do everything you're supposed to do or you're not getting in [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4115.0s)]
*  And so everybody is just like this like weird shell of a person trying to figure out what's the thing they're supposed to do [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4119.0s)]
*  What's the thing they're supposed to say, what's the thing they're supposed to support [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4127.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a miserable way to live, but [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4131.0s)]
*  But it's a whole industry [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4134.0s)]
*  And that's how you make fake stuff [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4136.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4137.0s)]
*  That's the only way to make fake stuff [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4138.0s)]
*  You got to get those fucking crazy people to pretend they're a minor [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4139.0s)]
*  There's plenty of those people willing to step up and act that way [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4143.0s)]
*  It's just a terrible place to like be a human [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4147.0s)]
*  And in that environment, it's so hard [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4151.0s)]
*  Like I so admire actors who are cool [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4154.0s)]
*  I so admire them [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4156.0s)]
*  Because like, oh, you're just a guy, you can just hang out [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4158.0s)]
*  Like Chris Pratt, bro, if he was right here, he's like my friend from high school or something [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4160.0s)]
*  He's like a regular guy, just happens to be a giant movie star [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4165.0s)]
*  Like how did you do it? You got through, you're alright [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4169.0s)]
*  Well his looks didn't hurt [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4172.0s)]
*  It helps [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4173.0s)]
*  Yeah, it helps a little bit [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4174.0s)]
*  But you can also be a douche with looks like that [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4175.0s)]
*  You can be, yeah [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4176.0s)]
*  If you are, it's like why? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4178.0s)]
*  Right [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4180.0s)]
*  You already won the lottery [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4181.0s)]
*  You're a douche and you look like that, you're like, dude, take it easy [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4182.0s)]
*  You're like the sweetheart of a guy [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4184.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of guys like that [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4185.0s)]
*  Like I've always loved Ethan Hawke, he says a lot of profound things [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4187.0s)]
*  He seems like a real normal guy, lives in Brooklyn [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4190.0s)]
*  Yeah, he seems brilliant [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4192.0s)]
*  Did you see that new movie? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4193.0s)]
*  I haven't seen it yet [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4195.0s)]
*  What is it called? [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4196.0s)]
*  The new Netflix movie, it's an apocalyptic [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4197.0s)]
*  Oh, it sucked [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4200.0s)]
*  Into the world [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4201.0s)]
*  Oh, I didn't like it [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4202.0s)]
*  You didn't like it? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4203.0s)]
*  No, I did not like it [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4204.0s)]
*  How dare you? What is it called? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4205.0s)]
*  Leave the World Behind [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4206.0s)]
*  Leave the World Behind? You thought it sucked? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4207.0s)]
*  I didn't like it [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4208.0s)]
*  What did you not like about it? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4209.0s)]
*  I just thought it, I don't know, it just didn't [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4210.0s)]
*  I loved it [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4211.0s)]
*  You loved it? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4212.0s)]
*  Yeah, the only thing I didn't love is the animals showing up in the backyard [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4213.0s)]
*  I'm like, this doesn't [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4215.0s)]
*  That seemed a little over the top [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4216.0s)]
*  It seemed a little over the top [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4218.0s)]
*  If I think what I didn't like about it, it seemed a little over the top [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4219.0s)]
*  I liked the theme of it, I liked how they kind of turned on each other a little bit [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4222.0s)]
*  Yeah, but not too much [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4226.0s)]
*  Not too much [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4227.0s)]
*  But it's coming [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4228.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4229.0s)]
*  You think they're preparing us? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4230.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, for sure they set up an affair [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4231.0s)]
*  For sure, Ethan's weak and the other dude is strong [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4234.0s)]
*  You know, that's gonna work out well [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4237.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's not enough people [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4239.0s)]
*  Yeah, Julia Roberts still looks great [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4241.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4243.0s)]
*  The thing that threw me off in that movie was the fake animals, the CGI animals [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4244.0s)]
*  Like that does, like you just took me away [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4249.0s)]
*  You've developed this intense psychological thriller [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4252.0s)]
*  You don't need to have this weird animal mystery thing in the middle of it [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4255.0s)]
*  And it didn't even go anywhere [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4258.0s)]
*  Exactly [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4259.0s)]
*  Well, there's no logic behind it [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4260.0s)]
*  There's no reason why the animals would all just show up in your backyard like that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4262.0s)]
*  And they never explained it or nothing ever happened [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4265.0s)]
*  Unless you live in Texas, they're everywhere [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4267.0s)]
*  But they're everywhere every day [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4269.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4270.0s)]
*  This movie was great and not so great in the same time [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4271.0s)]
*  Like that part was not so great [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4275.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4276.0s)]
*  Because it didn't make any sense [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4277.0s)]
*  But the rest of it did make sense that people do go sideways, you know? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4278.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4281.0s)]
*  I thought that who was, who played the guy that, oh, Kevin Bacon [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4282.0s)]
*  Kevin Bacon [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4289.0s)]
*  Like the crazy guy [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4290.0s)]
*  Underrated actor, he's so good [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4291.0s)]
*  He's such a good actor [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4292.0s)]
*  Very good [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4293.0s)]
*  I would have liked to have seen him more [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4294.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4296.0s)]
*  Why do you have one scene [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4297.0s)]
*  I agree with you [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4298.0s)]
*  With this fascinating guy who's already prepared [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4299.0s)]
*  I agree with you [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4302.0s)]
*  It seemed like that whole in the house stuff was like a little, we got it [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4303.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got it [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4306.0s)]
*  Like we kind of got that part [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4307.0s)]
*  Yeah, and also the tension didn't go anywhere [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4308.0s)]
*  They went up being friends [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4311.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4312.0s)]
*  You know, like the girl and Julia Roberts, like they hate each other [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4313.0s)]
*  They're bitching each other [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4316.0s)]
*  Then they're hugging each other at one point in time [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4317.0s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4319.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4320.0s)]
*  Why did you make them fucking cunty to each other? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4321.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4322.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4323.0s)]
*  That was just, yeah, I didn't love, I just didn't think it was, it could have been better [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4324.0s)]
*  Why did he not have his wallet on him? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4327.0s)]
*  Like what is all about this? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4329.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4330.0s)]
*  Drives there with, oh, I must have left it in my jacket [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4331.0s)]
*  It looks fake, you're setting me up [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4333.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4334.0s)]
*  There's real drama [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4335.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4336.0s)]
*  The world is over [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4337.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4338.0s)]
*  There's real drama [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4339.0s)]
*  Why do you get this weird interpersonal drama? [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4340.0s)]
*  There he is [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4341.0s)]
*  He was good in it [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4342.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4343.0s)]
*  You know what was really fascinating? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4344.0s)]
*  There was this one weird moment where the daughter and, what is the gentleman's name? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4345.0s)]
*  The same guy that's playing Blade, right? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4352.0s)]
*  MashaAllah Ali, I'm not sure exactly who that is [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4355.0s)]
*  How do you say his name? [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4358.0s)]
*  He's awesome [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4359.0s)]
*  He was great in it [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4360.0s)]
*  He's awesome [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4361.0s)]
*  He was great [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4362.0s)]
*  It's just like when the daughter said to him, you can't trust white people [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4363.0s)]
*  Everybody got so mad [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4366.0s)]
*  Everybody got so mad [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4368.0s)]
*  Isn't this a movie where two black people are in a house with white people at the end of the world? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4369.0s)]
*  You don't think that's a reasonable thing to say? [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4373.0s)]
*  No [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4375.0s)]
*  It's also part of the black psyche [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4376.0s)]
*  It's, they're always thinking that [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4378.0s)]
*  MashaAllah Ali [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4379.0s)]
*  They're always thinking like, can I trust this guy? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4380.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you say that you're a young girl? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4382.0s)]
*  That's on brand [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4384.0s)]
*  You're a young girl with tattoos and nose rings and you say don't trust white people? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4385.0s)]
*  Duh [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4389.0s)]
*  Duh [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4390.0s)]
*  Why would people be upset at that? [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4391.0s)]
*  Obama made this movie and this is the agenda [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4393.0s)]
*  No, that's not, watch the movie [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4396.0s)]
*  That's not what it's about [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4398.0s)]
*  Or hang out with black people [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4399.0s)]
*  There's always a little something where they always have it in their head a little bit [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4400.0s)]
*  Or they always have a story [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4404.0s)]
*  What did he say to you? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4405.0s)]
*  They went through some drama [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4406.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he said to me [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4407.0s)]
*  And you're like, whoa [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4408.0s)]
*  That one on one racism when no one's around has got to be the scariest shit [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4410.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4414.0s)]
*  That's got to be the scariest shit [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4415.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't just wash away that trauma [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4416.0s)]
*  It happened [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4418.0s)]
*  Yeah, but also it's a movie [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4419.0s)]
*  It's a movie about people that are experiencing heavy levels of anxiety [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4421.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4426.0s)]
*  Where the world is over [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4427.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4428.0s)]
*  There's war going on [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4429.0s)]
*  No one knows what happened [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4430.0s)]
*  Planes are falling from the sky [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4431.0s)]
*  This girl's mom's dead probably [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4432.0s)]
*  Spoiler alert [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4434.0s)]
*  Spoiler alert [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4435.0s)]
*  Well, everyone's overreacting now to how that's been politicized [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4436.0s)]
*  The race stuff and the DEI [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4441.0s)]
*  So if they see any glimpse of that, they just attach [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4443.0s)]
*  They get mad [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4445.0s)]
*  Even if it's just a reasonable part of a story [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4446.0s)]
*  Right [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4448.0s)]
*  I mean, you've got to give people room in fiction to make realistic human beings [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4449.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4453.0s)]
*  If you don't think a realistic 20-something year old girl who's with her dad [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4454.0s)]
*  Where they're in a guest bedroom of their own fucking house [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4457.0s)]
*  Because these other people Airbnb'd it but the end of the world is here [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4460.0s)]
*  You don't think you'd have some fucking shitty things to say [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4463.0s)]
*  Especially if there's no one around [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4466.0s)]
*  Especially if the woman who's Julia Roberts is acting like shitty [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4467.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4471.0s)]
*  At the beginning [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4472.0s)]
*  Yeah, doesn't trust you [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4473.0s)]
*  Yeah, everyone's so charged now on the culture war [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4474.0s)]
*  You can't avoid [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4478.0s)]
*  I just posted this clip on my Instagram where I made fun of [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4479.0s)]
*  Because Trump came up in the releases and Clinton came up in the releases [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4482.0s)]
*  Of course they say it's all been, they go, oh, that's all been debunked [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4486.0s)]
*  It's debunked, that's what the media says, it's all been debunked [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4489.0s)]
*  Even though both of them were hanging out with Epsi [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4491.0s)]
*  And it's like, what were you hanging out with them? Were you guys golfing? [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4493.0s)]
*  There's photos of them all together [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4495.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were at, and then Trump was at Clinton's wedding [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4497.0s)]
*  The Clintons were at Trump's wedding [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4500.0s)]
*  They're all hanging out [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4502.0s)]
*  Galane was at Clinton's daughter's wedding [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4503.0s)]
*  Exactly [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4506.0s)]
*  But I posted this clip and the comments are just people yelling at the other [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4507.0s)]
*  He wasn't on, they just can't see past [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4512.0s)]
*  Also, those people, a percentage of them are bots [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4517.0s)]
*  You think so? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4521.0s)]
*  100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, a certain percentage of those, 100%, a certain percent [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4522.0s)]
*  There's a certain number that are not real people [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4531.0s)]
*  That's true [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4533.0s)]
*  That is all what we were talking about earlier [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4534.0s)]
*  Foreign governance, they found so many of these sites [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4536.0s)]
*  They found so many of these troll farms, there's videos of them [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4540.0s)]
*  The Internet Research Agency in Russia is completely dedicated to trolling America online [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4544.0s)]
*  And dissolving our faith in democracy [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4549.0s)]
*  That must be a fun job to wake up to do [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4551.0s)]
*  Amazing [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4553.0s)]
*  You wake up, you just post [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4554.0s)]
*  Those dudes are funny [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4556.0s)]
*  I had Renee DeResta on, she's one of the people that investigated it [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4557.0s)]
*  And she said there's hundreds of thousands of memes [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4560.0s)]
*  Some of them are really funny [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4562.0s)]
*  I'm really laughing while I'm fucking documenting these things [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4564.0s)]
*  It makes sense, because I always thought, who's sitting around making these memes? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4568.0s)]
*  It's got to be somebody's job to do it [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4571.0s)]
*  There's definitely some of them are just funny people [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4574.0s)]
*  Because my friends have made memes and sent me memes [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4576.0s)]
*  Because it's about something that we did [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4578.0s)]
*  It's very funny [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4580.0s)]
*  I love memes, it's my favorite kind of comedy [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4581.0s)]
*  I know you send me sometimes, yeah they're great [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4584.0s)]
*  I don't tell you enough, I get a lot of good ones here [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4586.0s)]
*  Each one that we could never use on the air [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4588.0s)]
*  But I'm going to just show it to you real quick, because it made me laugh so hard [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4590.0s)]
*  It's horrible [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4602.0s)]
*  It's horrible [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4603.0s)]
*  It's horrible, but it gets the point across [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4604.0s)]
*  It's horrible [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4607.0s)]
*  Oh my god, there's so many of them [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4608.0s)]
*  You just laugh so hard, there's no victim [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4610.0s)]
*  There's no victim [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4613.0s)]
*  It's just... [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4614.0s)]
*  It's a one on one thing, I've sent that to my friends [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4617.0s)]
*  And they sent it to their friends, and we're all sent it to each other [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4619.0s)]
*  And I don't know where it came from [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4622.0s)]
*  It might have come from a troll farm in Macedonia [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4623.0s)]
*  No, that one seems, because it has no political implications [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4625.0s)]
*  That seems like it was probably made by somebody [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4628.0s)]
*  With a really funny sense of humor [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4630.0s)]
*  One of the things that they detailed is that they developed pages [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4632.0s)]
*  So they did develop an Instagram page or a Facebook page based on something that was popular [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4637.0s)]
*  So maybe they would use Yannis Poppets clips [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4642.0s)]
*  Use a bunch of clips of you and your characters and all your bits [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4644.0s)]
*  And then they do it without your consent [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4648.0s)]
*  And then they develop a channel [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4650.0s)]
*  They did one with a Barbie channel, like fans of Barbie dolls [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4651.0s)]
*  They did one with Legos [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4655.0s)]
*  And then, once they accumulate a following [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4657.0s)]
*  Then they'll switch it over and have it become a meme page [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4660.0s)]
*  And I've seen this before [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4663.0s)]
*  I went to one that I found the other day [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4664.0s)]
*  Because sometimes if a meme just stumbles across my Instagram [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4666.0s)]
*  I'm very curious about this whole process [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4669.0s)]
*  Like who's making these, where are they coming from [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4672.0s)]
*  So I clicked on the link [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4674.0s)]
*  And I went to their Instagram page and I saw a bunch of memes [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4675.0s)]
*  But also a bunch of weird stuff and some weird political stuff [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4679.0s)]
*  And I'm like, hmm, what is this? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4682.0s)]
*  So I scroll way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way back [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4683.0s)]
*  And in the very beginning it was just like a regular page [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4687.0s)]
*  It was like they were promoting something like some gaming thing or something like that [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4691.0s)]
*  And it was just a regular page [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4696.0s)]
*  And I think they'll do things like that just to try to get some traction of following going [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4698.0s)]
*  And then they'll start launching things [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4703.0s)]
*  Well then you could hack the algorithm just because the algorithm picks up on the engagement [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4705.0s)]
*  It's all computers [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4709.0s)]
*  A story in the Rolls-Royce Journal from a few years ago talks about a Los Angeles marketing company [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4710.0s)]
*  That got a bunch of smaller Instagram accounts to give them control [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4716.0s)]
*  They do that [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4721.0s)]
*  And then they started posting a bunch of Russian troll propaganda [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4722.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll do that [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4726.0s)]
*  They'll trick you into giving up your passwords and we'll handle this for you [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4727.0s)]
*  We'll manage things [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4731.0s)]
*  And yeah, I have a friend who was [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4732.0s)]
*  She was going to do like a podcast with this [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4735.0s)]
*  Russian musician, Suzanne Santo [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4739.0s)]
*  And she was doing this interview [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4741.0s)]
*  And they were going to do it live on like Facebook Live [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4745.0s)]
*  So you get like a video stream [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4748.0s)]
*  And so she's like, I'm not sure how to set it up [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4750.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, just give us control and we'll do it and we'll do it on your screen [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4752.0s)]
*  So she files all the stuff and enters in her code and her password and sends it to them [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4756.0s)]
*  And then they just shut off [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4762.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4763.0s)]
*  And then they just took over her account [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4764.0s)]
*  And they've been doing it to a bunch of different artists [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4766.0s)]
*  So if you have 100,000 followers or 150,000 followers [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4768.0s)]
*  Now they just take over your account and then they sell Viagra or fucking Bitcoin or whatever it is [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4771.0s)]
*  You can't get it back or [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4777.0s)]
*  Well, she got it back [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4779.0s)]
*  She got it back, luckily [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4780.0s)]
*  She protests and she knew people and she got it back [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4782.0s)]
*  But you could lose it forever easily [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4785.0s)]
*  Russian trolls made fake Kid Rock fan accounts and fooled Donald Trump Jr. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4789.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, man [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4793.0s)]
*  It's like it's not a small number of people [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4795.0s)]
*  I think it's a lot [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4797.0s)]
*  I think Rene DeResta was speaking about this from the 2016 elections [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4799.0s)]
*  Well, remember that whole, the Kid, the Covington Kids [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4804.0s)]
*  It was some account in Brazil that edited the video to start it [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4807.0s)]
*  So it looked like the [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4811.0s)]
*  Like he came up to them [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4813.0s)]
*  The kid came up to the [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4814.0s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4816.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was some account in Brazil, some fake account in Brazil [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4817.0s)]
*  Interesting [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4820.0s)]
*  And yeah, they look for moments to try to sow discord [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4821.0s)]
*  100% [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4825.0s)]
*  The more that they can get us at each other's throats [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4826.0s)]
*  It almost seems engineered [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4829.0s)]
*  It is engineered [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4833.0s)]
*  But I mean it almost seems engineered that we fall for it [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4834.0s)]
*  That our government doesn't step in and say, hey, look at what's going on here [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4837.0s)]
*  We need to figure out a way to mitigate this [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4841.0s)]
*  I think they have been [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4842.0s)]
*  I think they've been bringing it up [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4843.0s)]
*  They've been trying to [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4844.0s)]
*  What they've really been doing is trying to get at people that criticize the government [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4845.0s)]
*  That's what they really try to do [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4849.0s)]
*  They try to ban accounts that do things that they don't like [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4850.0s)]
*  And that's been shown in the Twitter files [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4853.0s)]
*  For sure [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4855.0s)]
*  But there's not the same kind of emphasis in going after Russian trolls [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4856.0s)]
*  That are trying to sow discord [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4860.0s)]
*  And try to encourage reasonable conversations [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4861.0s)]
*  There's not emphasis on that [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4865.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's more the social media company's responsibility [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4867.0s)]
*  I don't think they wanted to do it because it inflated engagement [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4870.0s)]
*  And they could go to their shareholders and say, look how popular our pages are [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4873.0s)]
*  We got a trillion members and like half of them are fake [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4877.0s)]
*  And look at all this engagement [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4880.0s)]
*  And half of it's fake [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4882.0s)]
*  They don't want to say half of it's fake because it looked good for the stock [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4883.0s)]
*  We've talked about this before [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4886.0s)]
*  But this is this guy who was a former [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4887.0s)]
*  Was he an FBI security analyst? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4888.0s)]
*  Is that what he was, Jamie? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4890.0s)]
*  That said that 80% of the accounts on Twitter may be fake? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4891.0s)]
*  That makes sense [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4894.0s)]
*  80 [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4895.0s)]
*  That's a lot [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4896.0s)]
*  Because you always meet regular people [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4897.0s)]
*  And they're like, what? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4898.0s)]
*  I'm like, did you see what happened on Twitter? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4899.0s)]
*  And they're like, what? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4900.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4901.0s)]
*  But I don't know what that means [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4902.0s)]
*  Does that mean 80% of the accounts are accounts where people have burner accounts? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4903.0s)]
*  Or like what percentage of them are just burner accounts? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4908.0s)]
*  Because there's a bunch of [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4910.0s)]
*  I know some comics that have burner accounts that say wild shit [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4911.0s)]
*  Just on [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4914.0s)]
*  Just log in through a fucking VPN and say some wild shit [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4917.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have any burners [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4921.0s)]
*  I don't have any burners [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4922.0s)]
*  I don't have any time for my own accounts [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4923.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4924.0s)]
*  I don't want to do a burner account [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4925.0s)]
*  But if I did [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4926.0s)]
*  You'd have some fun [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4927.0s)]
*  I'd have some fun [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4928.0s)]
*  There's a few I follow online [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4929.0s)]
*  They get people like on the ESPN to repost a fake tweet all the time [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4931.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4936.0s)]
*  Like daily [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4937.0s)]
*  They just word it or make the meme or the picture look so good or so right [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4938.0s)]
*  It just sounds outrageous enough [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4942.0s)]
*  Like so-and-so is fighting about something crazy [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4943.0s)]
*  And they just repost it without checking into it [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4946.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, that sounds like me [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4948.0s)]
*  How many times have we had something that I heard and I'm like, what is this I heard? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4949.0s)]
*  And then Jamie has to look at it and go, oh, this is what it's actually about [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4954.0s)]
*  Oh [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4958.0s)]
*  That happens [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4960.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the world we live in [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4961.0s)]
*  That's what happens when you [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4962.0s)]
*  If you want to do the show for real [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4963.0s)]
*  Like this [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4965.0s)]
*  Like if you want the show to be what it is [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4966.0s)]
*  Which is just talking shit in real time [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4968.0s)]
*  You're going to make some mistakes [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4970.0s)]
*  I'm going to say some things that I heard about [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4971.0s)]
*  They might not be true [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4973.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4975.0s)]
*  But is that really my fault? [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4976.0s)]
*  Like should we really be paying attention to that or should we be paying attention to that? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4977.0s)]
*  How are we so fucking confused? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4980.0s)]
*  How are there so many trolls? [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4982.0s)]
*  How much money is being spent to make us mad at each other all day long? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4985.0s)]
*  A lot of money [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4989.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4991.0s)]
*  And how do you develop immunity to that? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4992.0s)]
*  How do you develop antibodies to that? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4994.0s)]
*  How do you develop an ability to just not be affected by that? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4996.0s)]
*  And to have some sort of a moral, ethical personality compass [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=4999.0s)]
*  Where you know where North is [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5005.0s)]
*  Well, this is all new [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5007.0s)]
*  Never before has so much information been [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5008.0s)]
*  Never [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5010.0s)]
*  Available to people and so many different versions of reality presented [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5011.0s)]
*  So it's new [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5015.0s)]
*  Whatever is going to emerge [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5016.0s)]
*  It will be like some sort of superhuman who can be able to have unbelievable [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5018.0s)]
*  Intuition and just know [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5023.0s)]
*  Maybe this will force humans to evolve to a point where we can mind read [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5025.0s)]
*  Or any little face tick will be able to tell if you're lying or something like that [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5029.0s)]
*  Right [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5033.0s)]
*  Everyone else will get fooled [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5034.0s)]
*  But the ones who were able to tell the truth will be able to just like really [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5035.0s)]
*  Like, ah, his eye moved, I know he's lying, bullshit [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5039.0s)]
*  Yeah, think about voice memos [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5041.0s)]
*  You know how you say voice memos? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5044.0s)]
*  Like you could say into your phone, call Yannis Papas today at 4 o'clock [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5045.0s)]
*  And it writes it down in text [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5049.0s)]
*  That's kind of how a computer is at picking up whether you're full of shit [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5052.0s)]
*  But you're a lot better than that [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5057.0s)]
*  If you're talking to someone like, why didn't you meet us there? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5059.0s)]
*  It's like, oh, there's this thing I had to do [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5061.0s)]
*  I forgot to tell Mike [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5064.0s)]
*  I left my keys in my house [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5066.0s)]
*  You know, there's something about the way they're talking [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5069.0s)]
*  You're like, oh, he seems full of shit [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5072.0s)]
*  Like you just pick up at it [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5074.0s)]
*  Or like, are you mad? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5075.0s)]
*  No, I'm not mad [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5077.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5078.0s)]
*  And there's something [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5080.0s)]
*  You're like, no, dude, you're mad [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5082.0s)]
*  Tell me what's going on [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5083.0s)]
*  Why are you mad? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5084.0s)]
*  What's going on? [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5085.0s)]
*  Just let's talk [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5086.0s)]
*  Why are you mad? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5087.0s)]
*  Yeah, computers aren't as good as that [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5088.0s)]
*  Computers are going to say, I'm not mad [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5090.0s)]
*  Okay, good, he's not mad [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5091.0s)]
*  But you're like, dude, you're upset [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5093.0s)]
*  Let me ask you this, do you think it matters? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5095.0s)]
*  Do you think the truth matters? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5096.0s)]
*  Does it matter? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5098.0s)]
*  In what way? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5099.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5100.0s)]
*  Like, is there like massive consequences to living in a fantasy world [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5101.0s)]
*  Or believing lies or making up stories or stealing stuff [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5107.0s)]
*  Or like, plagiarizing [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5112.0s)]
*  Like, you know, Biden was caught doing [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5114.0s)]
*  Like, you know, is that Claudine Gay was a big story [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5116.0s)]
*  Now they're going after Eichmann's wife [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5119.0s)]
*  Like, does it matter? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5121.0s)]
*  Does originality matter? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5122.0s)]
*  Does being genuine matter? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5124.0s)]
*  And why? And why not? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5126.0s)]
*  Like, it's an interesting thing [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5127.0s)]
*  Because I think this is definitely not the era for being genuine [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5128.0s)]
*  This is the era of like, I want to make you believe what I want you to believe [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5132.0s)]
*  I want you to believe for my benefit [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5136.0s)]
*  I tend to be a glass is half full guy [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5138.0s)]
*  So I say, no, this is the age of being genuine [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5141.0s)]
*  Because that other stuff is everywhere [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5144.0s)]
*  And if you want to really just have actual connections with humans [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5147.0s)]
*  Just actually be a real human [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5152.0s)]
*  Like, be there [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5154.0s)]
*  And the only way you could do that is if you're being truthful [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5155.0s)]
*  Now, if you're plagiarizing [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5159.0s)]
*  And you're also trying to connect with people [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5162.0s)]
*  And you're trying to pretend that you're the person that figured these things out [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5165.0s)]
*  I don't know you [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5168.0s)]
*  I don't know your capabilities now [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5169.0s)]
*  Because they've been greatly inflated by you repeating someone else's work [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5171.0s)]
*  And trying to pawn it off as your own [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5175.0s)]
*  But that's rewarded [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5177.0s)]
*  It seems to be rewarded [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5178.0s)]
*  It's also a bust [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5179.0s)]
*  For a while, yeah [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5180.0s)]
*  But it's being busted now [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5181.0s)]
*  People are being busted [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5182.0s)]
*  And when you step out of line [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5183.0s)]
*  Like Claudine Gay did at that [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5184.0s)]
*  When they're speaking [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5186.0s)]
*  Was it a congresswoman they're speaking to? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5187.0s)]
*  They were asking her about [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5189.0s)]
*  Yes [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5190.0s)]
*  Is saying death to the Jews is that harassment? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5191.0s)]
*  And they're like, is it, if it's actionable [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5194.0s)]
*  They're like, well, it's the craziest thing I've ever seen in my life [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5196.0s)]
*  What were they wearing when they said it? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5199.0s)]
*  How did they say it? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5201.0s)]
*  It just shows how far this mind virus is taking people in academia [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5202.0s)]
*  They're literally out of their fucking minds [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5208.0s)]
*  And they're shaping young minds [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5211.0s)]
*  And they're influenced heavily by foreign governments [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5213.0s)]
*  That has always been the case [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5218.0s)]
*  That is what Yuri Besmanov talked about in the 1980s [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5219.0s)]
*  That's right, I've seen that video [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5223.0s)]
*  That video is wild [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5224.0s)]
*  And he talks about introducing Marxism and Leninism [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5226.0s)]
*  Into universities and education [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5230.0s)]
*  And making, changing the narrative for young people [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5233.0s)]
*  Destroying their faith in democracy [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5236.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5238.0s)]
*  And these people are a part of that system [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5240.0s)]
*  And they don't realize how fucking crazy it is [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5242.0s)]
*  How fucking crazy it is that you're doing this [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5246.0s)]
*  Yeah, they just not, they don't realize they're being manipulated [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5249.0s)]
*  They don't know what the source is [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5252.0s)]
*  They don't know what the intention is [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5253.0s)]
*  There's people in San Francisco with the masks on dancing around [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5255.0s)]
*  Because that's their world [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5258.0s)]
*  That's their environment [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5260.0s)]
*  Their environment is fucking crazy [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5261.0s)]
*  Everyone's kind of in a bubble, it's interesting [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5264.0s)]
*  And as comics we meet, we see the different bubbles [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5266.0s)]
*  By going from this city to that city [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5269.0s)]
*  And you're like, whoa, a lot of people [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5271.0s)]
*  Most people don't get the opportunity to do that [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5273.0s)]
*  So they just think their bubble is the way it is [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5275.0s)]
*  And they don't see the other perspective [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5278.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you don't travel a little [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5280.0s)]
*  You don't meet different kinds of people [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5282.0s)]
*  You don't know that different kinds of people exist [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5283.0s)]
*  Like, when I lived in Boston [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5285.0s)]
*  You get used to that kind of people [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5288.0s)]
*  You know, like fucking, fucking hot ass [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5290.0s)]
*  Fucking just hard working [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5292.0s)]
*  No bullshit [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5295.0s)]
*  I gotta shovel snow people [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5296.0s)]
*  Is there a version of you that stays in Boston [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5298.0s)]
*  Meets some wrong Italian kids [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5301.0s)]
*  You get a nickname like Joey Mulekicks [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5302.0s)]
*  Yeah, I could've stayed [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5306.0s)]
*  You say, fuck you, kid [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5307.0s)]
*  Hey, if I didn't do stand up [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5308.0s)]
*  I would've probably still be there [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5309.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how I would've figured out [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5311.0s)]
*  A way to travel the country without stand up [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5312.0s)]
*  I don't know if I would've gone anywhere [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5315.0s)]
*  I probably would've just stayed in Boston [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5318.0s)]
*  Complained about the winter every year [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5319.0s)]
*  Maybe a bunch of my friends as we got older [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5322.0s)]
*  We decided to escape to Florida [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5324.0s)]
*  Yeah, you go all inclusive [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5326.0s)]
*  Maybe a little Cancun action [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5327.0s)]
*  Nah, you're not gonna live in Cancun [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5329.0s)]
*  No, do an all inclusive [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5331.0s)]
*  Oh, vacation [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5332.0s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm talking about moving [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5333.0s)]
*  Oh, moving, oh, that's the dream [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5334.0s)]
*  I'm gonna stay [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5336.0s)]
*  Yeah, but most likely I'm gonna stay in Boston [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5337.0s)]
*  You're not gonna move to Florida [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5340.0s)]
*  And I'm not gonna be going on the road [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5341.0s)]
*  Like, as a comic, you do ridiculous [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5344.0s)]
*  You're in Ohio, then you're in Mississippi [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5346.0s)]
*  Then you're in Florida, then you're in Michigan [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5348.0s)]
*  Then you're in Nevada, then you're in Utah [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5350.0s)]
*  You're going all over the fucking place as a comedian [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5353.0s)]
*  That's an education in humans [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5356.0s)]
*  Such an education [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5359.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5360.0s)]
*  Such an education [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5361.0s)]
*  I speak to my brother all the time about that [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5362.0s)]
*  Like, he doesn't see the world [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5365.0s)]
*  He lives in D.C. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5366.0s)]
*  And sometimes I'll send him stuff [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5368.0s)]
*  Like, you know, making fun of Nancy Pelosi or whatever [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5370.0s)]
*  And he, like, just can't [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5374.0s)]
*  He can't process it [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5375.0s)]
*  And I'm like, you live in a bubble [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5376.0s)]
*  You're just in a... [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5378.0s)]
*  And at one point he was like, I do [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5379.0s)]
*  And I want to stay in it [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5381.0s)]
*  I want to stay in that bubble [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5382.0s)]
*  Well, if you're busy, I get it [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5384.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5386.0s)]
*  For them, the answer is truth important? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5387.0s)]
*  No [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5389.0s)]
*  No [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5390.0s)]
*  Can they get Uber Eats? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5391.0s)]
*  That's right [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5392.0s)]
*  Is Netflix on? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5393.0s)]
*  Is Netflix on? [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5394.0s)]
*  Are they getting a raise at work? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5395.0s)]
*  And we're not really a truth-seeking animal [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5396.0s)]
*  The truth is uncomfortable [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5398.0s)]
*  The truth is uncomfortable [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5399.0s)]
*  It's tedious, it can be vicious, it can be mean [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5401.0s)]
*  We're not a... [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5404.0s)]
*  Depends [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5405.0s)]
*  That's why I think we're so susceptible to marketing and advertising [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5406.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to know the real truth [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5408.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to know how the sausage is made [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5409.0s)]
*  Everyone wants to just believe the image that they see on the screen [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5411.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to know the truth [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5414.0s)]
*  And that's why I think there's often not a lot of consequences [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5416.0s)]
*  When people are caught being inauthentic [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5419.0s)]
*  Because people want to believe it [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5422.0s)]
*  People want to believe it [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5423.0s)]
*  Who do you blame, really? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5424.0s)]
*  I mean, the conner or the conned? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5425.0s)]
*  I mean, the conned are complicit [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5427.0s)]
*  You want to believe [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5429.0s)]
*  I think we're about five years away from mind reading [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5431.0s)]
*  I think it all goes out the window [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5434.0s)]
*  Once we can mind read? [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5436.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5437.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5438.0s)]
*  I think within five years, it's all out the window [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5439.0s)]
*  That's going to be interesting [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5441.0s)]
*  Have you seen the new Galaxy AI phones? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5443.0s)]
*  I'm not scared of it [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5444.0s)]
*  Put it in me [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5445.0s)]
*  Have you seen these new Galaxy AI phones that translate in real time? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5446.0s)]
*  No [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5449.0s)]
*  They translate in real time [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5450.0s)]
*  In language, audio rather, and in text [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5451.0s)]
*  So you have a phone [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5455.0s)]
*  You set the phone down [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5456.0s)]
*  Like we would have a phone that would set it down here [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5457.0s)]
*  And one half would be facing you [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5459.0s)]
*  The other half would be facing me [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5461.0s)]
*  Like the text is upside down [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5462.0s)]
*  So that you could read the text [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5464.0s)]
*  And I would say into it [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5465.0s)]
*  You know, in whatever language [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5467.0s)]
*  You know, hey, Yannis, you want to go to lunch? [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5469.0s)]
*  And it would translate into whatever language you have [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5471.0s)]
*  And then say it out in real time [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5474.0s)]
*  So the way it's, when it sets up [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5476.0s)]
*  So we can do it like where you see [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5478.0s)]
*  So you can do it a couple different ways [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5481.0s)]
*  One, you can do it when you're calling people [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5483.0s)]
*  That's on a call, the one on the screen [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5485.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you're calling people [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5487.0s)]
*  And as they're talking back [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5489.0s)]
*  It will translate it in real time [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5491.0s)]
*  And it would also translate if you're wearing [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5494.0s)]
*  I think the Galaxy earbuds [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5496.0s)]
*  It'll translate it in audio [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5498.0s)]
*  So it'll give you whatever that person's saying in English [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5500.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5504.0s)]
*  And then you say it back to them [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5505.0s)]
*  And it will translate it in Thai [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5506.0s)]
*  Or whatever they're speaking [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5508.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5509.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5510.0s)]
*  We're headed into an interesting place [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5511.0s)]
*  Right, so once you get to that [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5513.0s)]
*  Once you get to this [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5515.0s)]
*  Language is no longer a barrier [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5516.0s)]
*  So this is the beginning, right? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5518.0s)]
*  This Galaxy i [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5519.0s)]
*  This is like the best smartphone [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5521.0s)]
*  That you could buy right now [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5522.0s)]
*  This is the beginning [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5523.0s)]
*  And then what this is really is like Atari [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5525.0s)]
*  You know, this is like some shitty pixelated version [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5528.0s)]
*  Of a video game that you play [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5531.0s)]
*  Within 10, 15 years [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5533.0s)]
*  It's going to be the Unreal 5 engine [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5535.0s)]
*  It's going to be some insanely sophisticated way [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5537.0s)]
*  Where the moment you and I talk [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5540.0s)]
*  We're going to have earbuds in [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5543.0s)]
*  And we're going to be able to speak all languages [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5544.0s)]
*  I'll know exactly what you're saying [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5547.0s)]
*  You'll know exactly what I'm saying [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5548.0s)]
*  And it'll be razor focused [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5550.0s)]
*  It'll have it down to [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5552.0s)]
*  There'll be a few confusions and words and stuff like that [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5553.0s)]
*  But they'll iron that shit out over time [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5556.0s)]
*  And then there'll be universal discussions [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5558.0s)]
*  Universal talk [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5560.0s)]
*  And then we'll all be connected [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5563.0s)]
*  Into some sort of a hive mind [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5565.0s)]
*  Some sort of a matrix of frequencies [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5567.0s)]
*  That the brain is interacting with [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5570.0s)]
*  With all the other people around it [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5572.0s)]
*  So you're going to be able to do all this [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5573.0s)]
*  Without using words [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5575.0s)]
*  And we're all going to be reading each other's minds [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5577.0s)]
*  And you're going to know intentions [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5579.0s)]
*  You're going to know truth [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5580.0s)]
*  You're going to know deception [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5581.0s)]
*  You're going to know hate, anger, lust [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5582.0s)]
*  You're going to know when someone wants to fuck you [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5584.0s)]
*  You're going to know when someone wants to run away from you [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5586.0s)]
*  You're going to know everything [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5589.0s)]
*  Wow, that's going to be [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5590.0s)]
*  That's going to [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5591.0s)]
*  It's going to be a different kind of person [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5592.0s)]
*  It's going to be a different kind of world [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5593.0s)]
*  People would say, oh my god [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5595.0s)]
*  What would we even be then? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5596.0s)]
*  How could I live like that? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5599.0s)]
*  How could you live the way you live now [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5600.0s)]
*  In a metal box with rubber tires [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5602.0s)]
*  Going 70 miles an hour down a hardened surface [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5605.0s)]
*  They threw over the grass [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5608.0s)]
*  So you can get to your air conditioned house [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5610.0s)]
*  Where you've got a refrigerator with food in it [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5612.0s)]
*  And sit in front of a television [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5614.0s)]
*  That just pumps in other people's artwork [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5616.0s)]
*  Into your fucking brain [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5618.0s)]
*  So you pass out [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5619.0s)]
*  And then you wake up in the morning and do it all again [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5621.0s)]
*  You don't think that's crazy? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5623.0s)]
*  It's a great description [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5626.0s)]
*  That's fucking insane [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5627.0s)]
*  That's insane and that's everyday life [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5630.0s)]
*  That's normal [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5632.0s)]
*  It's normal to be completely connected to your phone [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5633.0s)]
*  Unincapable of leaving it in the house and going for a walk [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5636.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5641.0s)]
*  And we live like that now and we figured it out [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5642.0s)]
*  So we'll figure it out [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5645.0s)]
*  The mind reading thing's coming son [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5646.0s)]
*  It's coming [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5647.0s)]
*  It's going to be a totally different way of thinking [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5648.0s)]
*  Just like right now with the internet [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5650.0s)]
*  And with the access to information that we have now [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5652.0s)]
*  It's a completely different way of finding out what's true or what's not true [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5654.0s)]
*  Yeah even if you think about the way the world's changed [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5657.0s)]
*  Just by how criminals can't get away with doing crime [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5660.0s)]
*  There's cameras everywhere, there's DNA [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5663.0s)]
*  Everywhere [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5665.0s)]
*  I think that's probably why serial killers have gone away [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5666.0s)]
*  They haven't [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5669.0s)]
*  Well I mean they've lessened a lot right? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5670.0s)]
*  Yeah but there's a lot of random [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5672.0s)]
*  You can do random stuff [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5673.0s)]
*  Robot reimagines a digital experience with AI powered R1 device? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5675.0s)]
*  What is that? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5681.0s)]
*  What is it? [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5682.0s)]
*  It's got shown at CES [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5683.0s)]
*  Just the video that Lewis made from Unbox Therapy describes it pretty quickly [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5684.0s)]
*  I was trying to find a better video but this I think does it a really good job [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5687.0s)]
*  This kind of replaces the phone and we'll see if people really stick to this [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5690.0s)]
*  On their new AI powered device [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5695.0s)]
*  It's got a grill on it? It could be for the speaker, it could be for the mic [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5697.0s)]
*  Oh it's definitely a hardware device [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5701.0s)]
*  Oh there's the mics on the top [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5706.0s)]
*  It is like voice as the primary input [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5707.0s)]
*  It has a rotating camera and I saw a little SIM door as well [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5710.0s)]
*  It's a little cellular so standalone [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5714.0s)]
*  Start my morning routine [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5716.0s)]
*  Order me an Uber [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5717.0s)]
*  Check the fridge [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5718.0s)]
*  Order the ingredients to make that again tomorrow [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5719.0s)]
*  Watch what I'm doing here [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5721.0s)]
*  Process all my new photos today just like this [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5722.0s)]
*  Massage my prostate [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5724.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5726.0s)]
*  Well I mean [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5727.0s)]
*  Feed me cake, massage my prostate [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5728.0s)]
*  Figure out what my wife wants to eat and then goes can't compute [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5730.0s)]
*  It costs 200 bucks and it's coming out very soon [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5733.0s)]
*  But I can do stuff for you [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5736.0s)]
*  Right but the thing about phones is social media [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5738.0s)]
*  It's TikTok, it's YouTube, it's Instagram [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5743.0s)]
*  It's being able to see things over and over and over and over again [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5746.0s)]
*  If that doesn't have a screen or that little bitchy ass screen [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5749.0s)]
*  And it's mostly just talking into it [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5752.0s)]
*  There's other devices that are coming out now that are replacing that [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5754.0s)]
*  There's these very simple, they're cheap too [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5757.0s)]
*  27 inch screens that will follow you around your house [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5759.0s)]
*  What? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5762.0s)]
*  27 inches [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5763.0s)]
*  Yeah, touch screen [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5764.0s)]
*  It follows you? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5765.0s)]
*  It's full of apps and it's an Android device [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5766.0s)]
*  So wait a minute, does it float? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5767.0s)]
*  Like a robot? [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5769.0s)]
*  Right now it's like a little Roomba robot that can charge for 7 hours [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5770.0s)]
*  Imagine everywhere you walk you have a giant screen with you, you get nothing done [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5773.0s)]
*  How about the Apple goggles are coming out? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5777.0s)]
*  That's the other part of it too, you're going to decide if you want to wear these goggles or here's the LG one [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5780.0s)]
*  So what I was saying though about that Galaxy phone [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5784.0s)]
*  Is AI that allows you to translate like that [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5787.0s)]
*  Now allows you to do a bunch of other different things [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5790.0s)]
*  One of the things it allows you to do, like if there's a photo [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5792.0s)]
*  Like if someone sends you something, you just circle it [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5795.0s)]
*  And it'll do an immediate Google search of what that thing is [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5798.0s)]
*  It'll tell you what that thing is, you can buy it [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5801.0s)]
*  It'll give you links where it's for sale [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5804.0s)]
*  It'll give you a history on it, it'll take you to a Wikipedia page and whatever that thing is [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5806.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like chat, chat GBT does that pretty well now [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5810.0s)]
*  But it's in your phone [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5813.0s)]
*  It's in your phone, yeah [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5814.0s)]
*  You just circle things, it just goes right to them [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5815.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5817.0s)]
*  And it's also able to summarize things now [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5818.0s)]
*  Like say if you sit down with your phone and you make a bunch of voice notes [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5821.0s)]
*  Like you go on a rant about something [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5826.0s)]
*  You're like, I know there's something funny in this [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5828.0s)]
*  I don't want to work it out totally on stage [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5830.0s)]
*  Let me work it out in my office [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5832.0s)]
*  And you just go on a rant about this thing [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5833.0s)]
*  It will then transcribe it and then you could say summarize this for me [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5835.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5840.0s)]
*  And it will summarize it into bullet points and paragraphs [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5841.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I know now [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5844.0s)]
*  On your phone! [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5845.0s)]
*  Yeah, with chat GBT you could go on there now and go [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5846.0s)]
*  Give me a joke in the style of Joe Rogan [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5849.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5852.0s)]
*  And it'll give you a joke [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5853.0s)]
*  And then people could probably just change a few things [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5854.0s)]
*  Yup [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5856.0s)]
*  I don't know what being genuine is going to mean in the future [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5857.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to lead us to be more inclined to give in to this mind reading thing [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5860.0s)]
*  Because the opposite is going to be too much chaos [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5866.0s)]
*  If it's one or the other [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5870.0s)]
*  It's either complete chaos, you never know what's true [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5873.0s)]
*  Or you know everything that's true [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5875.0s)]
*  And we all have to agree that this is the best way [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5877.0s)]
*  The thing about that is if you know every [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5880.0s)]
*  If everybody has to wear it [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5882.0s)]
*  Dictators, everyone [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5883.0s)]
*  That ruins the entire hustle [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5884.0s)]
*  It ruins everything [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5887.0s)]
*  Instantaneously you can't pull off anything anymore [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5888.0s)]
*  Right [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5892.0s)]
*  All the people in Congress that are committing insider trading [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5893.0s)]
*  All the people that are in the military industrial complex [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5896.0s)]
*  That are in inflating dangers to try to get us involved in a military conflict [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5898.0s)]
*  It's going to get them a giant, fat contract [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5903.0s)]
*  They're going to make large dollars [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5906.0s)]
*  And then if you try to [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5908.0s)]
*  You'll see it all [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5909.0s)]
*  If you try to persecute somebody for a thought that they had [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5910.0s)]
*  Then they'll find out that if you had the same thought [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5914.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5916.0s)]
*  You're full of shit, man [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5917.0s)]
*  Or it'll also give [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5918.0s)]
*  Why are they mad at you for that? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5919.0s)]
*  Are they really upset? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5921.0s)]
*  Are they being charitable with their assessment of the way you think and behave? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5922.0s)]
*  Or are they just trying to play some stupid social game [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5927.0s)]
*  And win some little conflict with you [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5930.0s)]
*  And just get [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5933.0s)]
*  You think it'll get that sophisticated? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5934.0s)]
*  Will it understand the context of your feelings? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5935.0s)]
*  100% [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5938.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it'll be a new language [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5939.0s)]
*  I think it'll eventually evolve into a universal language [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5941.0s)]
*  So if we're going to be interconnected with AI [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5945.0s)]
*  Which with this new Galaxy phone, the S24 Ultra [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5949.0s)]
*  You clearly are interconnected with AI in your phone [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5952.0s)]
*  It's actually built into your phone [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5957.0s)]
*  They've engineered the chip to work specifically with AI in that phone [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5959.0s)]
*  This stuff is only going to get better, man [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5965.0s)]
*  Right [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5968.0s)]
*  It's only going to get better [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5969.0s)]
*  And I see it getting better to a point where [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5970.0s)]
*  We're probably going to be integrated physically with these things [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5975.0s)]
*  Whether it's something that you wear [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5980.0s)]
*  Like a little headset that you wear [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5982.0s)]
*  Or something that they put in your body [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5984.0s)]
*  And it's going to be way better with it than it is without it [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5986.0s)]
*  In the beginning, most people aren't going to do it [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5990.0s)]
*  But once they get it dialed in [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5992.0s)]
*  And they've developed some sort of [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5994.0s)]
*  Whether it's Neuralink [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5996.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of different competitors [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5997.0s)]
*  That are doing similar sorts of technology [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=5998.0s)]
*  Once they figure out a way to really enhance your brain [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6000.0s)]
*  And really enhance your ability to gather information [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6005.0s)]
*  And process information [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6008.0s)]
*  And supercharge it [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6009.0s)]
*  Everybody that has that [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6011.0s)]
*  We have such a significant advantage over everybody that doesn't [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6013.0s)]
*  That everyone's going to do it [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6017.0s)]
*  That we have a real risk of people not doing it [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6018.0s)]
*  Right, people are going to have to do it [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6020.0s)]
*  Right, because what if Kim Jong Un does it [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6022.0s)]
*  And just takes over the world [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6024.0s)]
*  What if the people that do it are the worst people alive [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6025.0s)]
*  And they just use that as to [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6028.0s)]
*  We're going to lock everything down [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6030.0s)]
*  Starve the world out [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6032.0s)]
*  Central bank digital currency [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6033.0s)]
*  Fucking drones everywhere [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6035.0s)]
*  No one gets away with anything [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6037.0s)]
*  No one gets a chip but me [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6039.0s)]
*  Right [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6041.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you become a god [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6042.0s)]
*  You become a super genius [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6043.0s)]
*  And there's no way to stop the progression of technology [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6044.0s)]
*  Impossible [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6047.0s)]
*  The only way is an asteroid [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6048.0s)]
*  Something big [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6050.0s)]
*  We'd have to have a natural disaster that sends us back into the stone age [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6051.0s)]
*  That might be the only way to stop AI [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6055.0s)]
*  Right [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6057.0s)]
*  Or nuclear war [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6058.0s)]
*  We can divert that with nuclear weapons or something [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6059.0s)]
*  Maybe that will come in handy [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6062.0s)]
*  I don't think they can do that yet [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6064.0s)]
*  Yeah, they probably can't [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6065.0s)]
*  I don't think they can do that yet [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6066.0s)]
*  But hopefully they will be able to [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6067.0s)]
*  Maybe someday [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6068.0s)]
*  But right now I don't think they can do that [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6070.0s)]
*  I think we're pretty far out [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6072.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6073.0s)]
*  Something's going to hit us eventually [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6074.0s)]
*  100% [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6075.0s)]
*  Yeah, something's going to hit us [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6077.0s)]
*  You look at the moon [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6079.0s)]
*  It's just been fucking hit so many times [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6080.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6082.0s)]

*  Looks like it's bad [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6085.0s)]
*  Accutane commercial [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6087.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been hit, man [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6090.0s)]
*  100% [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6092.0s)]
*  And we're going to get hit again [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6093.0s)]
*  We're in a shooting gallery [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6094.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6095.0s)]

*  And there's things just flying out there [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6098.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mad race [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6100.0s)]
*  It's a mad race to get to the point where you can defend it [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6102.0s)]
*  Have the technology and the ability to manipulate [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6104.0s)]

*  Yeah [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6118.0s)]
*  I can understand if people don't have kids [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6119.0s)]
*  They're like, who cares? Let it blow up [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6120.0s)]

*  I don't want the responsibility [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6128.0s)]
*  I get it [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6129.0s)]
*  But what I don't get is [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6130.0s)]
*  The world does need more people [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6132.0s)]
*  Do you like people? [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6135.0s)]

*  My favorite friends are people [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6138.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we're doing here is making people [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6140.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6142.0s)]
*  That's what we're supposed to do [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6143.0s)]
*  I love people [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6144.0s)]
*  The idea that we shouldn't make more people seems fucking insane [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6145.0s)]
*  It's crazy [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6148.0s)]
*  Especially when you do it [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6149.0s)]
*  And then you feel the love that you have for your kids [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6151.0s)]
*  And you're like, this is the greatest thing [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6153.0s)]

*  Everything about having kids is positive [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6159.0s)]
*  For most people [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6162.0s)]
*  I can't see how it's negative unless [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6164.0s)]
*  You're a fucked up person [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6166.0s)]
*  You're gonna be a fucked up person [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6167.0s)]
*  But if you're a little bit of a fucked up person, having kids makes you a better person [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6169.0s)]
*  I've definitely seen that happen before [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6172.0s)]
*  Where people experience the love of their child and they just straighten their life out [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6174.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6177.0s)]

*  Some people fall apart [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6185.0s)]
*  But they were gonna fall apart over something else anyway [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6186.0s)]
*  Exactly [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6188.0s)]

*  Yeah [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6191.0s)]
*  Some people just, they want, they get addicted also to being picked up [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6192.0s)]
*  They wanna fall apart [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6194.0s)]
*  Cause they want all the attention that comes with falling apart [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6195.0s)]
*  Yeah, cause you got your borderline personalities [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6198.0s)]

*  It's [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6209.0s)]
*  That's why like one dimensional, politically minded, ideology driven people online are so insane to me [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6210.0s)]
*  Like so insane to have that view of humans [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6219.0s)]

*  It's just [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6243.0s)]
*  That's how cults get started [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6244.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, it's there [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6246.0s)]

*  They know how to manipulate [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6259.0s)]
*  They do it [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6260.0s)]
*  They do it very effectively [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6261.0s)]
*  Marketers do it all the time [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6262.0s)]
*  Advertisers do it all the time [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6263.0s)]

*  Nobody can see it coming [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6283.0s)]
*  That one episode where he convinces that [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6285.0s)]
*  I think he's a famous comedian in England [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6287.0s)]
*  It was the craziest thing [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6289.0s)]
*  He brings him in [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6291.0s)]

*  What his ideal gift would be [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6294.0s)]

*  And his ideal present [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6299.0s)]
*  And seal it up [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6302.0s)]

*  Then he brings it in a room [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6304.0s)]
*  He puts him through this whole thing [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6305.0s)]
*  And he goes, okay [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6306.0s)]
*  Now, what's your ideal present? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6307.0s)]
*  And he changes it to the thing that he wanted it to be [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6309.0s)]
*  He's like, it's a red bike [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6312.0s)]
*  I want a red bike [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6313.0s)]
*  And then he opens the box [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6314.0s)]
*  It's a red bike [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6315.0s)]
*  And then they open the letter to see what he said [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6316.0s)]
*  And it was a leather jacket [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6318.0s)]
*  And even he forgot what he wanted [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6320.0s)]
*  And he said, I walked into the room going [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6322.0s)]
*  It's got a leather jacket, leather jacket [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6324.0s)]
*  But he manipulated him with suggestion [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6326.0s)]
*  And images and words that he said [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6328.0s)]
*  And he changed what his actual ideal gift would be [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6331.0s)]
*  And it's like, and you go [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6336.0s)]
*  And then he explains to you how he did it [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6338.0s)]
*  He shows you how he did it [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6339.0s)]
*  You're like, none of us have the defenses to stop that [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6340.0s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6344.0s)]
*  Well, it's just like that thing that you were saying [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6345.0s)]
*  That you do for your mind [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6347.0s)]
*  EDMR [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6348.0s)]
*  Like, there's a system [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6350.0s)]
*  You can kind of like hack it [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6351.0s)]
*  Hack it [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6352.0s)]
*  You can hack it [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6353.0s)]
*  You can hack the brain [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6354.0s)]
*  And then reprocess the memories [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6355.0s)]
*  Which essentially after you reprocess the memories [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6356.0s)]
*  You end up remembering them that way [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6358.0s)]
*  And the emotional charge gets removed [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6360.0s)]
*  And that's how it goes [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6362.0s)]
*  Now imagine AI hacking it [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6363.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6368.0s)]
*  And that's what these chips are gonna be [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6369.0s)]
*  That's what these things [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6370.0s)]
*  Whatever these things are that are gonna be in your brain [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6372.0s)]
*  They're gonna map it out [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6374.0s)]
*  They're gonna find out why things do this [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6375.0s)]
*  And why things do that [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6378.0s)]
*  And then just reprogram the whole thing [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6379.0s)]
*  It's gonna be crazy [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6381.0s)]
*  It's gonna happen in our lifetime [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6382.0s)]
*  It's crazy [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6384.0s)]
*  We're the last of the meat humans [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6385.0s)]
*  We're gonna have metal in us [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6388.0s)]
*  Yeah, not just metal [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6393.0s)]
*  Silicon, technology, batteries [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6395.0s)]
*  We're the last of the meat humans [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6398.0s)]
*  Do you think our body's gonna reject it at first? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6400.0s)]
*  People will get like infections, cancers [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6402.0s)]
*  Like you can't just put something in the brain [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6404.0s)]
*  The body rejects foreign objects [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6406.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does, but it doesn't [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6408.0s)]
*  Pacemakers work [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6410.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things that work [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6411.0s)]
*  True, true [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6412.0s)]
*  You just have to find something that's hypoallergenic [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6413.0s)]
*  And find something that's maybe organic [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6415.0s)]
*  Something that the body will integrate [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6417.0s)]
*  Just like it integrates with titanium neck discs [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6419.0s)]
*  True [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6422.0s)]
*  Your backs [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6423.0s)]
*  Well, you gotta take like some antibiotics and shit [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6424.0s)]
*  No, you don't have to [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6426.0s)]
*  If you get like plates in your arms and shit [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6427.0s)]
*  No [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6429.0s)]
*  Like if you get a broken arm [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6430.0s)]
*  And they put screws in there and plates [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6431.0s)]
*  You don't have to take antibiotics forever [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6432.0s)]
*  You do initially [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6435.0s)]
*  That's just because you've been cut [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6436.0s)]
*  It really has nothing to do with the metal [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6437.0s)]
*  Oh, okay [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6439.0s)]
*  You've just been cut open [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6440.0s)]
*  And you're exposed [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6441.0s)]
*  And you get MRSA [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6442.0s)]
*  You know, medication resistant staph infections [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6444.0s)]
*  Oh, good [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6447.0s)]
*  Those put people in the hospital for months [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6449.0s)]
*  They kill you too [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6451.0s)]
*  They kill people [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6452.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's some sketchy shit [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6453.0s)]
*  So like if you can put like a titanium rod in your shin [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6454.0s)]
*  They could put a little fucking thing in your spinal cord [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6458.0s)]
*  That's gonna be [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6461.0s)]
*  Just a little fucking little thing that you screw in place every day [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6462.0s)]
*  You know, you leave it charging by the bed when you go to sleep [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6466.0s)]
*  You screw it back in place [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6469.0s)]
*  And it's gonna be locked into the real matrix [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6470.0s)]
*  What would a conversation be like if we knew what was going on [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6474.0s)]
*  You'd be like, Yannis, calm down [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6477.0s)]
*  I know you're nervous [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6479.0s)]
*  Just relax [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6480.0s)]
*  No, no, no [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6481.0s)]
*  You'd be like, no, no, no [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6482.0s)]
*  Well, the argument is we're gonna create an artificial life [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6483.0s)]
*  And I'd be like, Joe, pay attention [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6485.0s)]
*  I know you're thinking about Marshall, stop it [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6486.0s)]
*  I'm here [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6488.0s)]
*  We'd be like [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6489.0s)]
*  It may be weird at first [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6490.0s)]
*  At first [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6492.0s)]
*  It'd probably be annoying [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6493.0s)]
*  It'd be the end of art [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6494.0s)]
*  I'd say thank you [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6495.0s)]
*  And Jamie would be like, for what? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6496.0s)]
*  I'd be like, well, Joe just thought that my hair looks good [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6498.0s)]
*  He would just say thank you with your mind [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6502.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6503.0s)]
*  He would go like that [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6504.0s)]
*  So we'd just sit in silence [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6505.0s)]
*  We'd just sit and make facial expressions at each other [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6506.0s)]
*  That was one of the first things Elon's had about it [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6508.0s)]
*  Said he'd be able to talk without words [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6510.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6511.0s)]
*  Do you think he'll be more like socially good? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6512.0s)]
*  Him? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6519.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6520.0s)]
*  You think his mind version will be like really on it [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6521.0s)]
*  As far as like timing and socially [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6524.0s)]
*  Because sometimes he'll pause [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6526.0s)]
*  But he pauses because he actually thinks [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6528.0s)]
*  He's thinking [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6530.0s)]
*  He's not bullshitting you [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6531.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6532.0s)]
*  If you ask him a question [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6533.0s)]
*  And it's a complex question [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6534.0s)]
*  He'll sit there [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6535.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6536.0s)]
*  And he'll run it through his head [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6537.0s)]
*  And really think [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6538.0s)]
*  That's the sign of a genuine intelligent person [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6539.0s)]
*  That's genius shit, yeah [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6541.0s)]
*  That's not a person who's just bullshitting for the masses [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6542.0s)]
*  It's understandable that he's socially a little weird [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6545.0s)]
*  Because his brain is doing a lot of fucking shit [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6548.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6550.0s)]
*  His brain's going through a lot of things [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6551.0s)]
*  Yeah, I asked him about it [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6553.0s)]
*  I'm like, what's it like being you? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6554.0s)]
*  He goes, you wouldn't want to be me [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6556.0s)]
*  His brain's just going [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6557.0s)]
*  Because I thought everybody was like that when I was young [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6558.0s)]
*  That everyone just had these ideas [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6560.0s)]
*  Just running through their head all day long [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6562.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6564.0s)]
*  It took them a while to realize [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6565.0s)]
*  Yeah, some people don't [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6566.0s)]
*  Some people don't, most people don't [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6569.0s)]
*  But I mean that's the kind of guy you need [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6572.0s)]
*  If you want someone who makes electric cars and rockets [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6574.0s)]
*  And fucking satellite internet [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6576.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6578.0s)]
*  And buys Twitter [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6579.0s)]
*  And that's why you need a system [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6580.0s)]
*  Like we have that allows those people to rise [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6581.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6584.0s)]
*  Well, also you need a guy with balls [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6585.0s)]
*  Like Elon had the balls to step in and buy Twitter [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6589.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6592.0s)]
*  And reinstate some fucking shaky ass people [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6593.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6596.0s)]
*  I mean that's a loss there [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6597.0s)]
*  Because advertisers are probably like, hey, who are you putting back on? [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6599.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then he said when they were like, you're going to blackmail me with money? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6601.0s)]
*  Fuck you [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6604.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6605.0s)]
*  Go fuck yourself [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6606.0s)]
*  Go fuck yourself [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6607.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6608.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6609.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's really how he feels [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6610.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6612.0s)]
*  When you've got that kind of scratch [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6613.0s)]
*  And he just keeps making more money [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6615.0s)]
*  How much is SpaceX going to be worth? [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6617.0s)]
*  How much is the boring company going to work [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6619.0s)]
*  Once they start actually fixing traffic with tunnels [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6622.0s)]
*  Shooting cars on the ground [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6625.0s)]
*  I mean this is an insane guy [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6626.0s)]
*  Well, he's essentially done what like Walmart does to small businesses [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6628.0s)]
*  But he did it for a good reason to try to promote free speech [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6632.0s)]
*  Because Walmart just goes in, loses money for a bit [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6635.0s)]
*  Until they charge you cheaper, lose money for a bit [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6637.0s)]
*  Until they put you out of business and then they recoup their losses [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6640.0s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't connect it to that [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6642.0s)]
*  I wouldn't compare it to that [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6644.0s)]
*  What I would say is this is probably from what I've read [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6645.0s)]
*  I haven't actually discussed this with him [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6649.0s)]
*  But what I've read is that this is one step in a multi-step process [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6651.0s)]
*  Of turning Twitter, now X, into an app you use for everything [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6655.0s)]
*  Used for banking [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6659.0s)]
*  They already have an AI that's attached to it [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6661.0s)]
*  What is it called? Grok? [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6663.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6664.0s)]
*  Why is it called Grok? [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6665.0s)]
*  What does Grok stand for? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6666.0s)]
*  Grok means like do you understand [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6667.0s)]
*  It's from one of the movies [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6669.0s)]
*  Because the word Grok means like do you understand, do you fathom it, do you [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6670.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6674.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6675.0s)]
*  In what language? [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6676.0s)]
*  In English [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6677.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6678.0s)]
*  Yeah, Grok [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6679.0s)]
*  No shit [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6680.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6681.0s)]
*  Whoa [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6682.0s)]
*  Oh that's a perfect name for AI then [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6683.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6684.0s)]
*  That's so cool [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6685.0s)]
*  I've literally never heard that word [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6686.0s)]
*  It's not a word used a lot [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6688.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6689.0s)]
*  That's actually the reason it says that's why they named it that [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6690.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6692.0s)]
*  Ah, that makes sense [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6693.0s)]
*  So they have the AI, right? [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6694.0s)]
*  So they named it Grok [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6695.0s)]
*  Now just think about how much open AI is worth [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6696.0s)]
*  The AI model called Grok [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6699.0s)]
*  Oh you son of a bitch [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6701.0s)]
*  Motherfuckers [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6702.0s)]
*  Yeah they always make you try to subscribe [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6703.0s)]
*  Motherfuckers and your god damn [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6705.0s)]
*  The AI model called Grok, a name that means to understand in tech circles [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6707.0s)]
*  Is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6710.0s)]
*  And has a rebellious streak [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6712.0s)]
*  So please don't use it if you hate humor [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6714.0s)]
*  Reads an announcement on the company's website [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6716.0s)]
*  Okay [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6718.0s)]
*  Um, but how much is open AI worth? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6719.0s)]
*  Like how much is that company worth? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6724.0s)]
*  How much is chat GPT worth? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6726.0s)]
*  Just Google that [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6727.0s)]
*  What's chat GPT worth? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6728.0s)]
*  So chat GPT is the one that people have been using [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6731.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6735.0s)]
*  And talking about more than any of the other ones [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6736.0s)]
*  I do know that Microsoft has one [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6737.0s)]
*  So it's worth what? [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6740.0s)]
*  How much? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6742.0s)]
*  You have to ask the right, what you said before [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6743.0s)]
*  What is the value of chat GPT? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6745.0s)]
*  What is, how much is chat? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6748.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6750.0s)]
*  29 billion, okay [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6751.0s)]
*  According to ZachJohnson.com [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6753.0s)]
*  Open AI is an American research organization with a current net worth of approximately 29 billion [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6755.0s)]
*  This one says 100 billion [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6761.0s)]
*  This is December 23rd, so this is really recently [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6763.0s)]
*  Open AI valuation 100 billion in-site with funding round [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6766.0s)]
*  And that's from Fortune [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6771.0s)]
*  Okay so it's in-site [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6772.0s)]
*  So let's just call it 80 billion [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6773.0s)]
*  Well he bought Twitter for 44 [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6775.0s)]
*  So even if Twitter is only worth 19 now [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6777.0s)]
*  Even if Twitter is only worth 19 now [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6779.0s)]
*  If this grok takes off [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6781.0s)]
*  There is a potential to be a competitor to something like this [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6783.0s)]
*  And to be just as big [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6787.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6788.0s)]
*  If people really start using AI for everything [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6789.0s)]
*  And it seems like they're going to start using it [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6791.0s)]
*  And they can incorporate it into devices and a bunch of different things [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6792.0s)]
*  And different ways to use it [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6795.0s)]
*  So you have that [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6796.0s)]
*  Then you have multimedia streaming [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6797.0s)]
*  He's doing the Tucker Carlson show which is there [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6799.0s)]
*  And I think he made a deal [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6802.0s)]
*  Don Lemon [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6803.0s)]
*  Yeah, who's going to watch that? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6804.0s)]
*  Maybe it'll be a wild version of Don Lemon [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6806.0s)]
*  I mean it's a wild version of Tucker Carlson now [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6808.0s)]
*  Lickered up Don Lemon talking shit [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6810.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Tucker's not the same Tucker [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6813.0s)]
*  I mean he's interviewing the guy who [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6815.0s)]
*  That con man who said he fucking blew Obama or whatever [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6817.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6821.0s)]
*  So he's having fun [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6822.0s)]
*  That one's wild [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6823.0s)]
*  That one's wild [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6824.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6825.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6826.0s)]
*  What are you doing bro? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6829.0s)]
*  It's a little different [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6830.0s)]
*  Why are you interviewing the guy who blew Obama? [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6831.0s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6834.0s)]
*  Who had like a huge record of conning and being a liar [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6835.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6840.0s)]
*  Did he have a huge record of being a con man? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6841.0s)]
*  Huge, huge [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6843.0s)]
*  Why do I want to believe him though? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6844.0s)]
*  Huh? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6845.0s)]
*  Because it's fun [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6846.0s)]
*  Because it's fun as fuck [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6847.0s)]
*  But when you look at the guy he's got like charges all [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6849.0s)]
*  Like his whole background is conning [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6852.0s)]
*  Well he's a hustler [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6854.0s)]
*  He's a gay hustler [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6855.0s)]
*  I mean that's basically what he's saying openly that he did with Obama [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6857.0s)]
*  Money, he got coke and gave him sex [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6860.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6863.0s)]
*  And Tucker's like I believe it [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6864.0s)]
*  Tucker's like I believe this guy [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6866.0s)]
*  He's so crazy to have that guy on your show [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6867.0s)]
*  Especially when just Googling his background [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6869.0s)]
*  And like he's not a new guy [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6871.0s)]
*  He's been around for a while [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6873.0s)]
*  He's come up in other political campaigns and stuff [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6874.0s)]
*  I think what Tucker's doing is brilliant [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6877.0s)]
*  First of all I think going over to Twitter was brilliant [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6879.0s)]
*  Because like so many people were paying attention to it then [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6882.0s)]
*  And the numbers were giant [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6885.0s)]
*  Like crazy numbers for some of the episodes [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6887.0s)]
*  Then you go to a subscription model [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6889.0s)]
*  Like nine bucks a month or something like that [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6891.0s)]
*  Whatever it is [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6892.0s)]
*  You know any people going to sign up for that? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6893.0s)]
*  Yeah, the subscription model is the best way to stay free [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6894.0s)]
*  You got to stay free [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6898.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you're not free you're fucked [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6899.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6901.0s)]
*  The only way in the future is going to be subscription models [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6902.0s)]
*  Most of these companies like if you're on YouTube right now [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6906.0s)]
*  You have to watch what you're saying [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6908.0s)]
*  I don't really know on Spotify [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6910.0s)]
*  Spotify's pretty fucking good [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6911.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6912.0s)]
*  But for the most part with a lot of these social media companies [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6913.0s)]
*  And these companies that are producing these things [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6917.0s)]
*  They have a very clear mindset as to what is acceptable and not acceptable [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6919.0s)]
*  Yeah, Spotify kind of stuck by you during all these controversies [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6924.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6927.0s)]
*  I want you to imagine if Tucker Carlson had a YouTube show [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6928.0s)]
*  And he brought on the guy that blew Obama [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6931.0s)]
*  It was just a YouTube show [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6933.0s)]
*  I'm tuning in even though I know it's a joke [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6934.0s)]
*  You're tuning in but don't you think they'd pull it? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6937.0s)]
*  Don't you think they'd mad at it? [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6939.0s)]
*  Well okay let's imagine it's Theo Vaughn has the guy on that blew Obama [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6940.0s)]
*  Now it's over [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6944.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6945.0s)]
*  They're going to yank him [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6946.0s)]
*  100% [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6947.0s)]
*  Probably yank Tucker more because Tucker was [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6948.0s)]
*  Theo would probably have a lot more fun with that [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6951.0s)]
*  Yeah but you can get rid of Theo [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6953.0s)]
*  And getting rid of Tucker is more of a stink [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6955.0s)]
*  Right [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6957.0s)]
*  You know like Theo Peloton contacted him [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6958.0s)]
*  When he had Robert Kennedy Jr. on [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6961.0s)]
*  And Peloton was like get rid of that episode [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6963.0s)]
*  Right [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6966.0s)]
*  And then Dana White found out about it and threw out all the Pelotons [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6967.0s)]
*  I heard about that yeah yeah yeah [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6970.0s)]
*  Just like companies have a very clear idea [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6973.0s)]
*  What you should be able to say and not be able to say [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6976.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6978.0s)]
*  And for comics in particular that's a real problem [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6979.0s)]
*  Yeah well you can't blame the companies [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6982.0s)]
*  They're just thinking about their bottom line [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6984.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6986.0s)]
*  I mean we would do the same if we worked for those companies [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6987.0s)]
*  Sure [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6989.0s)]
*  If you're just a numbers guy [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6990.0s)]
*  Yeah you're just a numbers guy [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6991.0s)]
*  And you're just a company [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6992.0s)]
*  Hey we don't want to be attached to that [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6993.0s)]
*  Yeah we need advertiser revenue [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6994.0s)]
*  Yeah it's not even about going like hey pro-con [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6995.0s)]
*  They're like we know it's a hot button topic for people or whatever [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=6997.0s)]
*  And we don't want to get into it [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7001.0s)]
*  We want to sell bikes [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7002.0s)]
*  That's why what Elon did is so wild [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7003.0s)]
*  You know that's really why it's so wild [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7006.0s)]
*  I mean everybody's back on X [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7008.0s)]
*  Everybody [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7010.0s)]
*  Hollywood Hogan [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7011.0s)]
*  We should be back on it [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7012.0s)]
*  He's like Hollywood Hogan he switched [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7013.0s)]
*  From Hulk Hogan to Hollywood Hogan [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7015.0s)]
*  Dun dun dun NWO X [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7017.0s)]
*  Everybody's back [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7019.0s)]
*  Everybody [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7020.0s)]
*  Everybody [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7021.0s)]
*  You see everything up there [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7022.0s)]
*  Mmhmm [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7023.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7024.0s)]
*  It's pretty interesting isn't it [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7025.0s)]
*  Well yeah there's a lot of good but yeah [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7026.0s)]
*  There's a lot of not so good [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7028.0s)]
*  I follow some people who are straight Nazis [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7030.0s)]
*  Oh there's definitely straight Nazis [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7033.0s)]
*  Straight Nazis [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7035.0s)]
*  The Taliban's on there [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7036.0s)]
*  Yeah I mean everybody [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7037.0s)]
*  The Taliban's on there [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7038.0s)]
*  The Nazis are on there [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7039.0s)]
*  Maybe that's good though [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7040.0s)]
*  Because then you can see them [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7041.0s)]
*  And you know what they're doing [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7042.0s)]
*  As opposed to having them hide [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7044.0s)]
*  And then you don't know what they're up to [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7046.0s)]
*  Well that was my argument about the feds [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7048.0s)]
*  Infiltrating these terrorist organizations [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7050.0s)]
*  Like especially even things like [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7053.0s)]
*  Well they couldn't even say if the feds were involved in January 6th [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7055.0s)]
*  Of course they can't say [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7059.0s)]
*  Because sometimes they have to be involved [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7061.0s)]
*  Like whether or not they did instigate [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7064.0s)]
*  Getting people to go into the Capitol [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7066.0s)]
*  I don't think they wouldn't do that [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7068.0s)]
*  But what's more important is [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7070.0s)]
*  If you've got something that might be an insurrection [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7072.0s)]
*  You kind of have to be there [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7075.0s)]
*  Like you have to [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7076.0s)]
*  You're a part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7077.0s)]
*  You have to look in that [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7081.0s)]
*  You're like [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7082.0s)]
*  But when it gets to like the plot to kidnap [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7083.0s)]
*  Governor Whitmer [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7086.0s)]
*  And you find out that there's 14 people involved [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7087.0s)]
*  And 12 of them are FBI informants [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7090.0s)]
*  12? 12 out of 14? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7093.0s)]
*  And these two fucking dopes get railroaded [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7096.0s)]
*  For the rest of their fucking life [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7099.0s)]
*  For some cosplay scheme in their head [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7100.0s)]
*  Their stupid 84 IQ head [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7103.0s)]
*  Of going and kidnapping the governor [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7105.0s)]
*  And you find out it's all set up by federal informants [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7108.0s)]
*  Like [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7110.0s)]
*  I think you're doing it wrong [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7113.0s)]
*  Is that what happened? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7114.0s)]
*  Yep [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7115.0s)]
*  I'm not aware of that at all [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7116.0s)]
*  This is the greatest story [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7117.0s)]
*  That's verified [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7119.0s)]
*  Oh yeah [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7121.0s)]
*  Pull it up, Jamie [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7122.0s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7123.0s)]
*  12 of them were informants [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7124.0s)]
*  Well the head of the Proud Boys was an FBI informant [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7127.0s)]
*  The head of the Proud Boys [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7129.0s)]
*  That's crazy [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7131.0s)]
*  He was an FBI informant? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7132.0s)]
*  Yes [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7133.0s)]
*  Wow [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7134.0s)]
*  And they still put him in jail [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7135.0s)]
*  That's dirty [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7136.0s)]
*  Dude, they invented [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7137.0s)]
*  There was a story [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7139.0s)]
*  A hilarious story [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7140.0s)]
*  That's like Whitey Bulger dirty [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7141.0s)]
*  Yeah, they did that [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7142.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was dirty [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7143.0s)]
*  That's another one [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7144.0s)]
*  And Bulger was a fucking murderer [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7145.0s)]
*  And he was working for the vets [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7147.0s)]
*  And he continued to murder as an FBI informant [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7148.0s)]
*  I don't think 12 of them were actually informants [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7150.0s)]
*  But they may have actually worked with the FBI in some form [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7153.0s)]
*  I don't know if it makes them an informant though [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7156.0s)]
*  This says only four [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7158.0s)]
*  Jamie, are you an informant apologist? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7159.0s)]
*  That's what I'm getting out of here [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7161.0s)]
*  It says only four? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7162.0s)]
*  No, there's more than four [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7163.0s)]
*  I know there's more than four [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7164.0s)]
*  I was reading this very detailed breakdown [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7165.0s)]
*  Of how many of the men had no connection to the FBI [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7169.0s)]
*  Here, go to the AP News [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7172.0s)]
*  FBI Lordmen [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7173.0s)]

*  It says four though [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7175.0s)]
*  I know [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7176.0s)]
*  That's the thing [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7177.0s)]
*  Wait a minute [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7178.0s)]
*  The four men charged with planning to kidnap [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7179.0s)]
*  How many other people were there that weren't those men that weren't charged? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7181.0s)]
*  Because the FBI informants weren't charged [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7185.0s)]
*  They said they were swayed by informants [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7187.0s)]
*  Exactly [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7189.0s)]
*  How many informants were there though? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7190.0s)]
*  Why don't you write how many FBI informants Whitmer kidnapping? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7195.0s)]
*  How many FBI informants? [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7202.0s)]
*  What does it say here? [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7208.0s)]
*  It says a total of 12 informants were ultimately involved in the investigation [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7209.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm saying [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7212.0s)]
*  So that's it [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7213.0s)]
*  That's the number that I had heard [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7214.0s)]
*  A total of 12 informants [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7215.0s)]
*  According to BuzzFeed [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7217.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is right here, this is the New York Times [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7219.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's see what they say [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7222.0s)]
*  Sometimes we don't believe in the New York Times [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7223.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were wrong about that fucking bombing of the hospital [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7224.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7227.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that's the story [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7228.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure there's 12 informants [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7230.0s)]
*  I'm not an informant [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7232.0s)]
*  Here you go, here you go [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7234.0s)]
*  The FBI deployed at least 12 informants as well as [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7235.0s)]
*  Several undercover as well as several undercover agents according to defense filings [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7238.0s)]
*  On the nighttime surveillance operation of the government's cottage [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7243.0s)]
*  For example, the defense described Big Dan as the main organizer [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7246.0s)]
*  Steven Robeson with a long history of both past crimes and work as an informant was there too [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7250.0s)]
*  The explosives expert who could topple a bridge was actually an undercover FBI agent [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7255.0s)]
*  As was the man in another vehicle [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7260.0s)]
*  The defense lawyers using the same trove of evidence material [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7262.0s)]
*  Have built an entirely different scenario of what happened [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7265.0s)]
*  They depict an accused as reluctant puppets [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7268.0s)]
*  Entrapped by the FBI agents and informants [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7271.0s)]
*  Whom they say came up with the kidnapping plot [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7274.0s)]
*  So it's a he said she said about [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7276.0s)]
*  Whether the informants were involved in the bombing [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7279.0s)]
*  Whether they the informants were like just going along getting the information or actually pushing them to do it [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7283.0s)]
*  Well, they also had actual FBI agents that were pretending they were [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7289.0s)]
*  Bomb experts were gonna blow up a fucking bridge [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7294.0s)]
*  Look, it's a scam. Yeah, it's a scam. You gotta you know, you gotta put out fires. You start a fire [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7297.0s)]
*  Well, there's firefighters that have done that [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7302.0s)]
*  It's it's suspicious that the FBI was heavily involved the whole way through this [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7304.0s)]
*  It's very seems weird as yeah, it's an understatement. Yeah, that's why didn't you just arrest them? [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7308.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you thought they were planning and so if you see them there doing that then you could easily say on January 6th [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7313.0s)]
*  They were there also rallying up morons [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7319.0s)]
*  Right the same time they probably were do that would do that [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7322.0s)]
*  Yeah, and they probably were because there are videos of people opening doors and shit [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7325.0s)]
*  So those videos are not also telling people let's go let's go in there [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7329.0s)]
*  Let's go in them feds people still went in there. They still did that [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7333.0s)]
*  So those did that yeah, you still have agency you're an adult they did it [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7337.0s)]
*  But yeah, it doesn't seem as clean as people think no, no, no, no, no, no [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7341.0s)]
*  Because they definitely wanted to make Trump look bad. Oh, yeah, they were constantly trying to make look Trump look bad [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7347.0s)]
*  They tried to do it with Russia. They've tried a lot of things to try to get that guy [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7352.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the videos that they show are like like it's getting stormed by barbarians [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7357.0s)]
*  Barians, but then you see that dude getting a tour the the shaman dude with a buffalo hat on that's right getting a tour [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7362.0s)]

*  There's a good chance they were doing that on January 6 as well Kevin Bacon from the Netflix movie. He would have zip ties. Yeah [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7388.92s)]

*  it you have to go all the way back to the beginning because [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7555.78s)]
*  The Jews made that land important to them for religious reasons because they used to be there [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=7558.099999999999s)]

*  I'm halfway towards the end and [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8564.52s)]
*  You have to maximize your time to the benefit of both yourself and everybody else around you [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8567.08s)]
*  That's what you got to do. You got to be as good a friend as you could be you got to be as good a [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8573.84s)]

*  Like who are you? [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8624.88s)]
*  Like are you a person that someone would gravitate towards are you particularly kind are you particularly friendly and generous? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8625.92s)]
*  Like what what is it about you that you think you should have someone that makes your life better? [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8633.72s)]
*  Because you probably ruin their life. You're fucking dour you complain all the time. You're so lazy [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8638.4s)]
*  It's hard to say that to somebody [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8644.56s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. Yeah, look at you, dude [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8647.88s)]
*  The reason why you struggle because you and also you're stuck because you're struggling you're probably tired all the time because you're depressed [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8650.44s)]
*  So it's very difficult to gather up the energy to make change to make all the radical change your life to say today [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8657.36s)]
*  I'm gonna get up at 6 a.m. And I'm gonna go to that fucking yoga class [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8662.640000000001s)]
*  And I'm always saying I'm gonna get to that 630 yoga and then the alarm goes off like fuck that [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8665.4s)]
*  I don't really have to get up till 8 and I'm just going back to sleep or just go to that yoga class and then 8 o'clock [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8669.480000000001s)]
*  Rolls around and you're leaving you're leaving the yoga studio. You got your rolled-up mat here with those other people [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8674.24s)]
*  All fucking did it everybody did it. We fucking did it. We got up early [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8679.92s)]
*  We did the 90 minute class and now I'm gonna go to work and now I got some momentum [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8682.96s)]
*  But it's hard to just make that first step and that's one tiny little step in this [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8687.8s)]
*  Gigantic journey of self-improvement and if you don't take those steps at all if you're that fucking dude that just gets at home [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8694.08s)]
*  We just medicated watching Netflix. We reads wake up do it all over again. You're gonna feel like shit [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8700.199999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's hard for people to take the first step [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8706.92s)]
*  I think because a big part of depression is feeling like it's gonna last forever [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8710.16s)]
*  It's kind of the delusion that that feeling pitches you. Yeah, it's a weird mindset where you [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8714.560000000001s)]
*  everything is poisoned every thought you have is poisoned with this negativity and [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8722.2s)]
*  You start to actually think back at your life and think that it was all that way when it wasn't [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8725.960000000001s)]
*  Mmm, and that's it's hard to remember the good times. And yeah when you're in a dark place [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8730.560000000001s)]
*  I think the thing to remember is that it it doesn't like it like the suicide [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8734.8s)]
*  Suicide comes in your brain as like an escape hatch. It's like your fight-or-flight thing going like this is an escape [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8740.96s)]
*  It's trying to help right? It's like when your immune system is [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8745.88s)]
*  Overactive it's like your fight-or-flight is overactive [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8750.56s)]
*  so you have to remember that and just get getting help people sometimes just don't get help because of shame or [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8753.42s)]
*  Whatever but it always ends the bad always ends if you if you put the work in and remember that it doesn't last forever [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8761.8s)]
*  And that your thoughts are not there. It's it's a delusion. You're in right now. It's not real [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8768.92s)]
*  Like it's your brain is playing a trick on you [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8773.599999999999s)]
*  It's it's not a real it's not a reflection of reality [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8778.039999999999s)]
*  It's a reflection of the way you feel and the way you feel is fucked up right now and that's changeable [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8781.82s)]
*  Yeah, but it's hard to realize that when you're in it and that's why people struggle with it and they make you know [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8787.2s)]
*  Unfortunate decisions and some people take their lives and stuff like that. It's because they mistake it for something. That's that's unchangeable [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8793.28s)]
*  That's ever-present because that's the way it feels but feelings are not facts. Ask Ben Shapiro [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8800.64s)]

*  Well, it's because the very mindset that allows you to be creative is the opposite of the mindset that would make you plagiarize [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=8998.72s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, and some guys are really good at marketing and that's a big thing now [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=9005.44s)]

*  You know, yeah actual artists. So it's the same kind of mindset [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=9019.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it works and then when you take an idea you it's easier because you can see it works [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=9022.880000000001s)]
*  So you're right. You're a confidence you're a of confidence in when going in well [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=9027.6s)]
*  That's why the comics that get busted their their specials after that always terrible [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWPNdqKP0D4&t=9031.28s)]
