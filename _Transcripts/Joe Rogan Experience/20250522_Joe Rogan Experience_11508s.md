# Joe Rogan Experience #2326 - Jimmy Carr
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=0.0s)]
*  I think I got it from this show, the sauna cold plunge thing. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5.5s)]
*  I bet you did. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=21.36s)]
*  I'm so into it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=22.36s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=24.42s)]
*  So addicted to it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=25.42s)]
*  It changes your life. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=26.42s)]
*  It really does. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=27.94s)]
*  It's that dopamine for like... [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=29.14s)]
*  You're changing my life by crushing this liquid IV in the most bizarre way possible. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=31.220000000000002s)]
*  It's like somehow it's all schmushed up. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=36.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's humidity. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=38.46s)]
*  It probably got a little humidity in there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=41.1s)]
*  It needs one of them little packets you get in the chips that you always accidentally [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=42.94s)]
*  bite. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=45.86s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=46.86s)]
*  You know those little things they put in there to like absorb humidity. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=47.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=50.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=51.02s)]
*  I think that's what they're for, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=52.02s)]
*  They absorb humidity. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  Is that what they do? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=55.620000000000005s)]
*  Salt or something. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=56.620000000000005s)]
*  Maybe they provide it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=58.3s)]
*  Do they provide humidity? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=59.3s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=60.3s)]
*  I'm now staying in, not exclusively, but like my hotel choice. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=61.3s)]
*  I'm solving for places with sauna cold plunge so I can kind of do that in the morning and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=68.42s)]
*  feel alive. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  There's a lot more of those now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=73.53999999999999s)]
*  It's great. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  But you travel the world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=76.97999999999999s)]
*  I travel everywhere. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=77.97999999999999s)]
*  So I was in like Vienna and they've got this incredible facility. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=78.97999999999999s)]
*  And I went and it's like, you know, it's an amazing sauna, amazing cold plunge. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=82.62s)]
*  So I get in there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=87.14s)]
*  I'm having a great time. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=88.14s)]
*  A guy walks in and I get told off for wearing shorts because I've got swim shorts on and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=89.14s)]
*  it's Austria and they'd like to sauna naked. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=95.86s)]
*  They want to look at your cock. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=99.06s)]
*  They want to check it out. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=100.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=101.74s)]
*  And I know I've got no problem with that in a sauna. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=102.74s)]
*  I've got zero problems in a sauna. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=103.74000000000001s)]
*  I tell you where the problem comes. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=105.3s)]
*  Post cold plunge. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  That is some baby dick. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=109.74000000000001s)]
*  You know where the real problem comes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=110.98s)]
*  Aggressive gay men. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=113.38s)]
*  In saunas? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=115.14s)]
*  No. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=116.14s)]
*  I mean, there was very little of that going on, I think. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=117.14s)]
*  Well, most of the time. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=120.06s)]
*  I think saunas had that reputation for... [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=121.34s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=123.66s)]
*  I've had a guy do it to me. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=124.66s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=126.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=127.38s)]
*  I got to look me in the eye and take his robe and open up his towel while he's staring at [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=128.38s)]
*  me. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=132.94s)]
*  Is there more to this story? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=133.94s)]
*  Where does this... [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=136.14s)]
*  No. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=137.14s)]
*  That feels like... [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=138.14s)]
*  No. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=139.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=140.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=141.14s)]
*  There's no more to the story. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=142.14s)]
*  Is the guy okay, Joe? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=144.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=145.3s)]
*  I didn't hurt him. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=146.3s)]
*  I don't think I even said anything to him. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=147.3s)]
*  I just went like this and then just didn't look at him. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=149.34s)]
*  And then within three minutes, he put his towel back on and walked out and left. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=154.82s)]
*  So he was fishing. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=160.74s)]
*  And that's how I met... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=162.38s)]
*  Threw a line out there. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=163.38s)]
*  That's how I met your mother. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=164.38s)]
*  And that is how I met Tony Hinchcliffe. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=166.42s)]
*  That's the origination story. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=168.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=173.34s)]
*  It was insulting because he wasn't even a handsome gentleman. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=174.34s)]
*  You know? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=177.34s)]
*  Well, I mean... [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=178.34s)]
*  He wasn't even a good looking guy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=179.34s)]
*  You're not in that business. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=180.34s)]
*  I'm not in that business. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=181.34s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=182.34s)]
*  You're not in that business. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=183.34s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=184.34s)]
*  I don't know, right? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=185.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=186.34s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of bears out there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=187.34s)]
*  A lot of guys are into the big guys. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=188.34s)]
*  You know? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=189.34s)]
*  They're into big, fat, hairy guys. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=190.34s)]
*  That's a thing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=191.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=192.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=193.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=194.34s)]
*  This guy wasn't even that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=195.34s)]
*  He wasn't even a bear. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=196.34s)]
*  You're disappointed that the guy that hit on you wasn't attractive enough. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=197.34s)]
*  I've only had a few times in my life where men have aggressively hit on me and both [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=201.34s)]
*  of them have been disappointing. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=205.18s)]
*  Two ones in recent memory that I can remember. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=207.22s)]
*  Not recent memory. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=210.02s)]
*  Like within, you know, as an adult. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=211.02s)]
*  In saunas in... [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=213.26s)]
*  No. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=214.26s)]
*  One in a bar and one in the sauna. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=215.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=219.34s)]
*  So in the bar. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=220.34s)]
*  So how did you know the guy was hitting on you? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=221.54s)]
*  I knew the guy. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=223.1s)]
*  He's a gay guy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=224.1s)]
*  And he just was getting drunk and then he started getting silly. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=225.26s)]
*  But he got a little handsy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=228.98s)]
*  You know, like kept touching me. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=231.5s)]
*  And I was like, you need to stop doing that or you're going to get hurt. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  Stop touching me. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  It just makes you realize like what it's like to be a woman. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  But way worse. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  I think it's... [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=242.1s)]
*  Way, way worse. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=243.1s)]
*  I think it's very good for empathy to have that experience. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=244.1s)]
*  To have a guy aggressively drunkenly hit on you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=247.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=250.62s)]
*  And to know what it's like. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=251.62s)]
*  I often think like being a bit famous, you kind of know what it's like to be a very attractive [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=252.62s)]
*  woman. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=257.38s)]
*  But you don't because you're not as vulnerable and no one's trying to stick their dick inside [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=258.78s)]
*  you for the most part. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=263.06s)]
*  I mean in terms of you have predictable conversations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=264.06s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=267.58s)]
*  I often think like... [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=268.58s)]
*  You get bullshitted. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=269.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=270.58s)]
*  Super attractive women have the same conversation with people over and over again. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=271.58s)]
*  And you blame them for being boring. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=274.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=276.1s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=277.1s)]
*  Hey, you come around here a lot? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=278.1s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=279.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=280.1s)]
*  It's the same conversation again and again and again. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=281.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=282.98s)]
*  I always noticed that my friend Roisin Conaty pointed this out to me. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=283.98s)]
*  She said really, really attractive people like gorgeous supermodels speak very, very [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=287.22s)]
*  slowly because no one has ever interrupted them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=294.1s)]
*  Like I speak quick because I'm rocking this. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=302.3s)]
*  I go quick, come on, let's get something going here. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=304.78000000000003s)]
*  Come on. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=307.38000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=308.38000000000005s)]
*  That's actually a very good point. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=309.38000000000005s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=310.38000000000005s)]
*  And also you probably value your opinion way too highly because no one would ever question [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=311.38000000000005s)]
*  your ability to form a sentence or to figure something out because they want to have sex [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=315.74s)]
*  with you. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=320.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=321.34s)]
*  So this is how horoscopes got big. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=322.34s)]
*  Incredibly attractive women spoke about their horoscope and no one went, this sounds like [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  some bullshit. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=329.78s)]
*  It's interesting you burnt that up because I was just watching the Danny Jones podcast [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=330.78s)]
*  today and he had my friend Hamilton Morrison, who's been on this podcast a few times. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=334.74s)]
*  And they were talking about the Reagan administration and about how the war on drugs really got [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=338.94s)]
*  started. Like this is your brain on drugs, all that stuff. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=345.22s)]
*  Nancy Reagan's pet project. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=347.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=349.54s)]
*  And it was because Nancy Reagan, according to Hamilton, and he's got he's very well [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=350.54s)]
*  I've heard this. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=355.18s)]
*  She had like a guru. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=356.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=357.5s)]
*  But this is where it started. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=358.5s)]
*  She was mocked for being like this frivolous person who was the wife of the president. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=360.22s)]
*  And Hamilton sort of relates it to the way Melania Trump gets mocked. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=366.5s)]
*  And she had apparently famously spent like an insane amount of money on new China for [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=371.74s)]
*  the White House, like new silverware in China. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  China. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  Like dishware. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=382.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but that's how we pronounce it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  China. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=385.5s)]
*  China in the Trump household. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=386.5s)]
*  China. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=387.5s)]
*  But it wasn't a Trump household back then. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=388.5s)]
*  It was Reagan. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=390.3s)]
*  That was a terrible Reagan impression. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=391.3s)]
*  But so anyway, she went to her psychic slash whatever it is, astrologer slash whatever [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=393.82000000000005s)]
*  this kooky person is. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=400.21999999999997s)]
*  And they gave good advice. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=402.02s)]
*  They said you got to do something to distract it. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=403.02s)]
*  So you have to have a cause. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=405.06s)]
*  And so her cause became the war on drugs. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=406.46s)]
*  Her cause became just say no. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=409.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=411.65999999999997s)]
*  I mean, did that work out? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=412.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I forget how the war on drugs go. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=414.7s)]
*  How are we doing? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=416.7s)]
*  Not just that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=417.82s)]
*  Well, Hamilton points out how many people were arrested and how many lives were destroyed [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=418.82s)]
*  because of this decision by this one woman who was the wife of the president who [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  was trying to cover her ass because she was looking silly in the press. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=430.26000000000005s)]
*  I got I got crazy drug views. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=433.78000000000003s)]
*  You want to hear my drug views? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=435.34000000000003s)]
*  I would love to hear your drug views. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=436.34000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=437.34000000000003s)]
*  My marijuana specifically. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=438.34000000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  I think marijuana should be illegal for the under 30s. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=440.34000000000003s)]
*  I think it should be legal 30 to 50. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  And then I think over 50 mandatory. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=446.1s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=448.94s)]
*  I don't like the under 30. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=449.94s)]
*  But I in all defense, I did not start smoking marijuana until he became 30. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=451.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's that thing of like this performance enhancing drugs. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=456.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  And then there's and there's there's lots of them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  I mean, testosterone is probably the biggest and the best. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=463.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=466.41999999999996s)]
*  Oh, there's way better ones than testosterone. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=467.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, but testosterone in terms of the world. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=468.9s)]
*  If you look at the world, like people often quote the fact that most of this, you know, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=471.14s)]
*  the biggest CEOs in the world are male. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=475.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=477.78s)]
*  But also 95 percent of the prison population is male because what testosterone gives you [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=478.78s)]
*  is its risk. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=483.14s)]
*  It's the chemical for risk. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=485.14s)]
*  So people take high risk. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=486.7s)]
*  So they end up with all the rewards, but also destitute with how much your privacy is being [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=487.86s)]
*  invaded online. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=492.97999999999996s)]

*  It's a necessity. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=497.21999999999997s)]
*  Some people think I don't need a VPN because I have nothing to hide. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=498.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=583.9s)]
*  Also women have more testosterone than they do estrogen. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=584.9s)]
*  That's interesting, isn't it? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=587.42s)]
*  Wild. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=588.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=589.42s)]
*  I never knew that until I forget who said it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=590.42s)]
*  I was like, that's kind of crazy. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=591.42s)]
*  But it's that thing of like, you know, for young women, if you're talking to young women, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=592.42s)]
*  like what would the advice be? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=595.98s)]
*  And it's like, because young men take risks, right? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=597.54s)]
*  But young women tend not to take the same risks. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  But maybe if you do more calculated risks, kind of levels the playing field a little [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  bit. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=607.74s)]
*  Playing field for what game? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=608.74s)]
*  Well, I suppose career. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=609.74s)]
*  What choices you make in life? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=612.0999999999999s)]
*  I think I wonder how much crossover there is between women's decisions, career paths [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=614.18s)]
*  and men's like how often are women actually competing with? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=620.5s)]
*  Obviously they do. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=624.3s)]
*  But how often? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=625.3s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=626.96s)]
*  Like if there wasn't any societal pressure for a woman to be a career woman and a boss [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=627.96s)]
*  girl, you know, because there's a lot of that, there's like pressure to like show that you're [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=632.76s)]
*  as good as everyone else who's also doing this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=637.6600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, Sally is a CEO, you should be a CEO too. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=640.8000000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of pressure. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=644.0s)]
*  But if you just let them decide their own path, how much crossover there would there [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=645.0s)]
*  be with men and women? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=650.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=652.12s)]
*  There's a lot of it's like Mary Harrington and Louise Perry, these kind of great feminist [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=653.12s)]
*  writers. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=658.24s)]
*  And they often sort of talk about this thing of like going, we talk about one stage of [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=659.24s)]
*  feminism above and there's three. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=663.8s)]
*  There's like there's the maiden, which is, you know, the young woman out for a career [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=666.68s)]
*  who can do just as they can do anything a man can do. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=671.88s)]
*  Right? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  And then there's motherhood, which a man cannot compete. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=676.5600000000001s)]
*  But feminism doesn't really talk about motherhood that much. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=679.16s)]
*  It's like it's become almost like a right wing thing to like celebrate motherhood. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=682.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=686.96s)]
*  And then there's what they call the crone, the older woman post menopausal, who's absolutely [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=687.96s)]
*  pivotal in our society. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=694.88s)]
*  If you think about anyone having a crisis, just a woman comes from nowhere in her 50s [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=696.64s)]
*  or 60s and makes you a cup of tea and takes care of you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=703.0s)]
*  It's like it's an incredibly that grandmother figure is so important in our culture, in [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=705.92s)]
*  our society. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=710.2s)]
*  It's not celebrated enough. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=711.24s)]
*  I don't think. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=712.24s)]
*  No. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=713.24s)]
*  Well, I had a bit of one of my specials back in the day about my mom. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=714.24s)]
*  My mom actually did say this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=719.1600000000001s)]
*  She voted for Hillary Clinton because she said, you know, I just want a woman to be [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=720.48s)]
*  president. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=723.88s)]
*  And I said, you already make all the people like that's all the people. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  There's eight billion people. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=731.76s)]
*  All of them made by women. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=733.12s)]
*  I go, you want to be president to you fucking greedy bitch. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=734.12s)]
*  I'm like, what else you want? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=736.72s)]
*  All the money you want? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=738.2s)]
*  You want a bigger dick? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=739.2s)]
*  What do you want? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=740.2s)]
*  You want everything? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=741.2s)]
*  We don't celebrate the craziest thing, which is women make human life without them. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=742.2s)]
*  It is not possible for any of us to be here. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=748.72s)]
*  And that is almost like inconsequential. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=751.6800000000001s)]
*  It's like you're not even we don't even we don't even talk about it. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=754.36s)]
*  And the sacrifice made the thank you for your service. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=757.0400000000001s)]
*  We really should say that to every mom. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=760.44s)]
*  Thank you for your service. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=762.32s)]
*  You're making humans, especially if you're doing a great job. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=763.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=765.76s)]
*  If you're a solid mom, that's amazing. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=766.76s)]
*  It's an amazing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=767.76s)]
*  Solid mom. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=768.76s)]
*  Think about the best dad in the world is what? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=769.76s)]
*  It's a mediocre mom. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=772.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=773.8s)]
*  Like if I take my kids to the playground, it's like, oh, fantastic. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=774.8s)]
*  If mom does it, it's kind of expected. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=779.48s)]
*  It's already factored in. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=782.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=783.16s)]
*  It is a weird thing, right? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=784.16s)]
*  That that's not really celebrated in society because any of us that have had good moms [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=785.92s)]
*  really and not most importantly, if you have friends that have evil mothers, we were talking [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=790.96s)]
*  about a story we read on here the other day. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=796.04s)]
*  Oh, well, this young girl was being like brutally stalked online and harassed. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=798.44s)]
*  And it turned out it was her own mother that was doing it. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=804.44s)]
*  Yeah. And it's you. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=806.44s)]
*  You can't get over the. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=807.36s)]
*  How do you psychically? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=808.36s)]
*  How do you recover? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=810.24s)]
*  How do you trust anyone for the rest of your life? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=811.16s)]
*  Your own mother. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=813.96s)]
*  So it's like there's so many people out there that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=815.36s)]
*  Are just going through so much just with family life that like a good mom, a mom [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=821.2s)]
*  that like takes care of you, like, you don't you don't appreciate it because you think [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=828.24s)]
*  it's like you're supposed to have that. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=831.16s)]
*  My God, that's so important. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=833.24s)]
*  It's so important. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=835.32s)]
*  And I think it's I think it is like we're more impressed with CEOs, which is hilarious. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=836.32s)]
*  It's nothing right. But that thing about being loved unconditionally. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=840.52s)]
*  Yeah. By your mother. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=844.36s)]
*  And I was absolutely loved unconditionally by her in such a brilliant way. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=845.6800000000001s)]
*  And you go that it kind of gets you to self-confidence. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=852.28s)]
*  Like, you know what self-confidence is going to feel like, because that's it's sort of [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=856.24s)]
*  the same feeling. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=859.28s)]
*  Right. Right. Right. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=860.48s)]
*  We just accepted. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=861.92s)]
*  Yeah. But you're enough. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=863.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's not about what you do or they're happy just to see you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=865.24s)]
*  Like, here's Jimmy, my Jimmy. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=869.36s)]
*  Give me a hug. They're so happy to see you. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=871.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=873.76s)]
*  I mean, that's what all human beings want from friendships, from everything. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=875.0799999999999s)]
*  We all just want to be loved and accepted. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=879.9599999999999s)]
*  And then all the other stuff is just lashing out because you weren't loved and [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=881.88s)]
*  accepted enough or it's trying to get that in a weird way, a weird way. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=885.68s)]
*  So you're trying to be you know, you're trying to collect stuff. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=890.2399999999999s)]
*  So you get respect and admiration rather than from what you do. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=893.12s)]
*  And then it's like the mean people, like mean people have always been hurt. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=897.8399999999999s)]
*  There's no mean people that just had nothing but love. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=901.64s)]
*  Right. Unless there's some something psychotic, something broken, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=904.56s)]
*  like genetically broken, which you get that from having kids as well. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=909.4399999999999s)]
*  Like when you have kids, you start to see everyone else says, oh, you used to be a baby. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=913.36s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. What happened? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=920.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, some you got bad information in a bad neighborhood with bad people around [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=921.0799999999999s)]
*  you and a lot of crime and there you are. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=924.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=927.76s)]
*  And that's what's always disturbed me the most about people that don't have people [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=929.16s)]
*  that have had good lives who don't have empathy for the plight of people that are [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=934.92s)]
*  in the total economic urban struggle. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=939.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, you're preaching to the choir here. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=944.2s)]
*  I think that thing of like gratitude as the mother of all virtues and the idea of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=946.08s)]
*  going, we don't see how lucky we are because we might see on a surface level, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=951.52s)]
*  like of going, oh, you know, I'm lucky because I'm healthy and, you know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=955.84s)]
*  I'm able to write jokes. Right. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=960.12s)]
*  But then you don't see the kind of the layer below that of going, well, I was born [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=962.0s)]
*  with I think like beauty is a really interesting thing. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=965.64s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=968.2s)]
*  So you see someone and they're born beautiful. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=968.36s)]
*  Margot Robbie and what you might go, she's Barbie. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=971.12s)]
*  She's gorgeous. It's easy for her. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=974.24s)]
*  But when you look at Oppenheimer, you don't see, well, that guy was born with an IQ [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=976.04s)]
*  of 160 and a work ethic. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=981.24s)]
*  Now, work ethic is heritable, largely heritable, like 70 percent heritable. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=988.8000000000001s)]
*  And you don't just develop that. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=989.92s)]
*  No, I don't think so. I think like it's what I mean, you develop some of it. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=991.4s)]
*  And, you know, what what you inherit, what you get in your, you know, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=994.8s)]
*  your factory settings when you come out, that's what it is. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=999.3199999999999s)]
*  You can only work with the other stuff. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1002.04s)]
*  So that's the interesting stuff. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1004.36s)]
*  But factory settings, you think, involve work ethic? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1005.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1008.88s)]
*  OK, OK, thanks. He's on it. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1010.0s)]
*  I don't think my own life is a different example. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1011.92s)]
*  You think your work ethic is to think it's just I developed it, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1016.72s)]
*  recognizing that it's valuable. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1020.64s)]
*  And I think a lot of it I got from martial arts, something like my parents [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1022.76s)]
*  didn't have a work ethic, it just it was especially the physical stuff. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1026.68s)]
*  It was never no one in my house did anything physical. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1030.48s)]
*  They didn't know, didn't do any sports, definitely didn't do any martial arts. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1033.96s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't inherited at all. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1037.72s)]
*  And then the idea of pushing yourself. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1040.96s)]
*  Well, just I learned from a young age [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1043.44s)]
*  that if you work harder than everybody else, you get better. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1045.96s)]
*  It was just like simple math. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1049.16s)]
*  And then it was also like [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1050.92s)]
*  the feelings will power rather than your willpower is a funny word, because it's [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1053.08s)]
*  it's really just knowing that there's a value in continuing to do things you [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1059.6000000000001s)]
*  don't want to do and that there's a process. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1066.56s)]
*  And it's hard to see the process when you're in the middle of it because it [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1069.04s)]
*  sucks and you're tired and you don't want to keep doing this. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1072.3600000000001s)]
*  It's hard to do. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1075.72s)]
*  But if you recognize, oh, the more I do that, the better I get. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1077.0800000000002s)]
*  If you're an intelligent person, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1082.0s)]
*  if you're an objective person and analysis all the factors that are at play, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1083.72s)]
*  you go, OK, what is the major factor here in terms of getting better at a thing? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1088.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, the major factor is work. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1093.2s)]
*  Like the more work you do and the harder you work and the more intelligent you [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1095.88s)]
*  work, like the more intensity and the more enthusiasm you have, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1100.3200000000002s)]
*  you just get way better than everybody else. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1104.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, I've also thought that that's a really interesting thing of how hard you [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1106.16s)]
*  work is important, but what you work on is the most important. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1109.68s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's that thing about you. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1115.16s)]
*  We're talking about horoscopes or something. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1116.4s)]
*  You it's amazing how much knowledge and [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1118.32s)]
*  information and expert someone can be in total horseshit, total horseshit. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1121.04s)]
*  But I think this is where we get back to the Danny Jones podcast. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1125.8s)]
*  I think there might be something to the original astrology. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1130.24s)]
*  I think the people that were like really [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1135.2s)]
*  studying constellations and when people were born, I have a feeling that that is [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1137.84s)]
*  some like really ancient civilization knowledge that we just have like echoes of. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1143.84s)]
*  You know, when it got got [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1149.6s)]
*  kind of famous in our culture was, I think it was a birth of a royal baby [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1152.08s)]
*  in about 1910, something like that, and the London Evening Standard had [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1156.76s)]
*  they'd ran out of things to say about a royal baby. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1163.04s)]
*  It's cute. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1165.72s)]
*  You know, it's got little baby fingers and baby toes. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1166.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1169.52s)]
*  And they they did that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  They got someone came in and went, oh, you know, it was born here and it's [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1171.72s)]
*  it's the year of the rat and it's a it's a Virgo and it's and that means with [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1176.1599999999999s)]
*  Sagittarius rising and they wrote the thing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1181.48s)]
*  And then they realized everyone is kind [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1183.9599999999998s)]
*  of self obsessed and wants to read about themselves. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1186.72s)]
*  So that's that's the one bit of the newspaper that's about you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1189.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1193.0s)]
*  So naturally, people are drawn to that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1193.84s)]
*  And it's like cold reading. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1196.0s)]
*  It's like the way that they word these things. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1197.32s)]
*  You go, well, that could apply to anyone. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1199.2s)]
*  Right. But it does give you a nice chance to focus on you. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1201.36s)]
*  What about what's going to happen with me? [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1204.68s)]
*  Yes. But what about me? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1206.88s)]
*  The news? Who cares about Beirut? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1208.84s)]
*  What about me? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1211.72s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's the in the human condition. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1213.4s)]
*  That's going to be a big part. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1216.1200000000001s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1217.28s)]
*  And that's how you sell newspapers. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1218.48s)]
*  I think the newspaper version of the horoscope is obviously nonsense, at least [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1220.44s)]
*  partially, I shouldn't even say obviously. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1224.5600000000002s)]
*  But I think I have not studied this and I'm not committed to this. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1226.72s)]
*  But I do think the origins, the original [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1231.0s)]
*  origins of astrology were probably based on some sort of an ancient [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1233.5600000000002s)]
*  understanding of the different effects that different stars when they're in [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1239.88s)]
*  alignment have on the universe. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1246.28s)]
*  And I think it's partially. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1250.08s)]
*  Look, we know that the moon literally makes the tide go in and out. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1252.1999999999998s)]
*  The gravity of the moon affects the water. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1258.28s)]
*  It makes the tide go in and out to the point where there's a high tide and a low [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1261.9599999999998s)]
*  tide mark at the beach. This is why I'm rehydrating now. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1267.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes, I realize I'm mainly water, mainly water. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  So if we're mainly water, like how is that not affecting us? [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1273.1999999999998s)]
*  Is it? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1276.28s)]
*  Is it affecting us in some weird way that we don't totally understand? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1277.32s)]
*  But the idea that a constellation, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  a hundred million light years away, could be affecting us seems a bit of a stretch. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1283.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's what the idea is. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1289.04s)]
*  The idea is that there is an infinite number of possibilities in terms of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  personalities and character traits, and there's an infinite number of factors. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1295.52s)]
*  There's genetic factors, there's environmental factors, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1299.8799999999999s)]
*  there's all these different factors that might be cosmic factors. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1302.84s)]
*  I don't think it's the primary source [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1306.6399999999999s)]
*  of your personality or how you feel about the world. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1308.68s)]
*  But I think it might be a factor. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1312.56s)]
*  And I think it was probably much more [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1314.96s)]
*  of a factor when they didn't have light pollution. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1317.8799999999999s)]
*  I wonder, is it one of these things where [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1321.68s)]
*  it's a really interesting way to think about yourself and analyze yourself? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1324.56s)]
*  It's almost like I don't have religion, but I can see the benefits of it. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1328.24s)]
*  I don't think religion works because like mass doesn't work because God is happy, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1331.64s)]
*  but mass works because people come together as a group and they kind of they [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1336.24s)]
*  meditate and take an hour off. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1340.56s)]
*  And I sort of think the great mistake, the tradition I'm from is Catholicism. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1342.24s)]
*  Me too. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1347.88s)]
*  And the great mistake was, I think, Vatican II, they called it. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1348.56s)]
*  So Vatican II is where they translated [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1352.08s)]
*  the Latin into whatever your local language was and made it more accessible. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1353.92s)]
*  That was like the 1500s, right? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1357.92s)]
*  And it's such a huge mistake because the idea was to be in awe. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1359.8s)]
*  It's like going to church should be like standing in nature. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1364.6s)]
*  But I think the issue of something, as soon as you translate it and you go left [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1367.56s)]
*  brain and try and make it make sense, it all falls to pieces. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1371.24s)]
*  But it's not a left brain. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1375.24s)]
*  Our whole culture is left brain, but it should be about right brain. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1376.56s)]
*  It should be about the the the gestalt, the whole thing. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1380.1599999999999s)]
*  The idea of like there's a mystery here. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1384.12s)]
*  And what's that great line? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1386.32s)]
*  God, God is the name we give to the blanket. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1387.76s)]
*  We throw over the mystery to give it shape. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1390.24s)]
*  Oh, I like that. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1392.12s)]
*  I think that's ACDC's roadie said that. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1393.8799999999999s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1396.64s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1399.2s)]
*  But what a piece of wisdom. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1400.08s)]
*  Because it's a genius piece of wisdom. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1401.12s)]
*  But it is that thing of like you can call it whatever you want. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1403.2s)]
*  And you attach it to whether it's horoscopes or whatever your religion is. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1405.36s)]
*  But the idea of going there is a mystery. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1409.76s)]
*  And even when you get to, you know, physics at the I mean, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1411.28s)]
*  I love it when you have physicists on here. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1413.68s)]
*  I mean, Eric Weinstein is one of my favorite people in the world. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1415.36s)]
*  I just think he's a he's brilliant. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1417.92s)]
*  He's a great, great guy. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1419.92s)]
*  Yeah, great guy. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1421.28s)]
*  And but you you look at that and you go and they get to the Big Bang and you go, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1422.32s)]
*  yeah, but what happened four minutes before that? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1426.04s)]
*  And they go, oh, we don't know. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1427.48s)]
*  Well, we're back to the mystery then. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1429.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1430.64s)]
*  Well, there's no escaping the mystery once you get into like subatomic particles. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1431.24s)]
*  Like what's going on there? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1435.64s)]
*  So do you need religion where you go, OK, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1437.12s)]
*  a random selection of atoms coalesced into a form that can contemplate its own [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1439.96s)]
*  consciousness and existence for four thousand weeks? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1447.24s)]
*  Is that not enough? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1451.8000000000002s)]
*  Will that not do? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1454.48s)]
*  No, we need miracles, Jimmy. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1457.88s)]
*  But when you go going back to the translation of the Bible's, one of the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1460.68s)]
*  things I want to say, I think the reason why that was important at the time was [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1464.2s)]
*  because that power was being abused because most people couldn't read Latin. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1468.24s)]
*  And most people couldn't read. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1472.2s)]
*  I mean, really, when you think about reading, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1473.28s)]
*  yes, it was the Bible was the reason the Bible was the bestseller that people [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1475.24s)]
*  went, no, I've got to go out and read a book. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1479.4s)]
*  I got to get out. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1481.48s)]
*  It was pivotal event for the Catholic Church convening from 1962 to 65. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1483.32s)]
*  Oh, so we're talking about a different time. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1488.56s)]
*  So we're thinking of the second Vatican, Vatican II. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1490.3600000000001s)]
*  Is that what you are referring to? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1495.04s)]
*  So that was 1962. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1497.0800000000002s)]
*  We're referring to is the 1500s. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1498.48s)]
*  We're referring to like Martin Luther. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1501.0s)]
*  Oh, no, that's the Protestantism. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1503.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the idea of the translation of the Bible's into different language. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1504.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1509.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, the because it was originally in Latin. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, that was originally that was probably an Aramaic. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1512.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1515.8799999999999s)]
*  And then but the idea of the Protestantism was the idea that you want. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1516.36s)]
*  You've got your own relationship with God. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1519.76s)]
*  So it went from being Catholics and Protestants to ultimately [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1522.08s)]
*  every individual was their own church. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1526.44s)]
*  Martin Luther's perspective was like it's open to interpretation by you. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1528.6s)]
*  You should develop this relationship with God through the word and that you should [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1533.76s)]
*  read and it wasn't up to the priest to tell you what it meant. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1538.6399999999999s)]
*  It's fascinating, though, that like the there's a law of history. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1542.76s)]
*  They only want there's one law in history, which is unintended consequences. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  And the consequence of that, of course, is that we we over solve for the individual [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1550.6399999999999s)]
*  in our culture now, Protestantism had such a huge influence. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1556.08s)]
*  That's all about the individual and less about the group. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1559.32s)]
*  Well, isn't it going to be a balance of the two? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1562.8s)]
*  But it's a response to the power structures that were really detrimental [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1564.8s)]
*  and the power structures of the church. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1569.8s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason why the priests aren't allowed to have sex. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1571.44s)]
*  It's because they were fucking everybody because they had power. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1574.24s)]
*  You know what happened? What happened? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1576.68s)]
*  OK, the plague happened. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1578.4s)]
*  So when the plague happened, it wiped out about a third of the population of Earth. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1580.68s)]
*  Right. So the plague was huge. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1586.4s)]
*  Now it had a much worse effect on the priesthood because everyone got last [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1588.1999999999998s)]
*  rights. So when you were dying, you got last rights. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1594.1999999999998s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1597.36s)]
*  Priesthood was knocked out like 95 percent of priesthood. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1598.36s)]
*  Oh, my God. I didn't even think of that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1601.36s)]
*  The standards pre the plague, the standards in the church were the smartest guy [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1603.04s)]
*  you've ever met, the smartest guy in the village, the town, the region was the priest. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1608.36s)]
*  The smartest of the smartest guy, the most intelligent guy became the bishop. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1613.3999999999999s)]
*  And the pope was like, this guy's a genius. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1618.1599999999999s)]
*  It was the best of the best, the creme de la creme. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1620.36s)]
*  The standards for the priesthood post [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1623.1599999999999s)]
*  the plague, this guy's got all his own teeth. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1628.1599999999999s)]
*  You're in. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1631.2399999999998s)]
*  Like it went down. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1632.36s)]
*  And then all that thing of like the plenary indulgences where you could buy [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1634.12s)]
*  your way into heaven is all, you know, all of that came off the back of the thing. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1637.7199999999998s)]
*  So the standards kind of went down and then it became kind of corrupted. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1644.28s)]
*  How dirty is that one, the buying your way into heaven? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1648.32s)]
*  Well, it's I mean, well, people don't realize that people often laugh at like [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1651.52s)]
*  the, you know, he's going to blow himself up to get 72 virgins. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1655.6s)]
*  The Crusaders all got a fast track to heaven. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1660.68s)]
*  Nice. Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1663.8s)]
*  Some guy tells you, yeah, I've just I've just discovered this. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1667.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1672.2s)]
*  I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day and she was telling [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1674.08s)]
*  me that there's a list of human beings that are alive today that are being [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1676.72s)]
*  considered for priesthood. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1681.76s)]
*  Like they have to think, excuse me, for sainthood, for sainthood. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1685.44s)]
*  Yeah. So they have to like go over all these different religious figures that are [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1689.28s)]
*  alive currently and decide if they're going to be a saint, who's going to be a saint. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1694.8s)]
*  You know, Christopher Hitchens, the great Chris Hitchens, right. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1698.72s)]
*  Christopher Hitchens, literally, you ever heard the phrase the devil's advocate? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1701.68s)]
*  Of course he had that job. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1706.56s)]
*  So when Mother Teresa was made a saint by the Catholic Church, they bring someone in [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1708.92s)]
*  when they're making someone a saint in the Catholic Church in the Vatican to be [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1714.08s)]
*  the voice of the opposition and he got the job. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1717.68s)]
*  He played to the devil's advocate for real on Mother Tracy. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1720.52s)]
*  He wrote a book about it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1723.84s)]
*  I've always wondered about him. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1725.04s)]
*  Loved the guy, pissed off a lot of people, got cancer. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1728.24s)]
*  I hate to be the conspiracy theorist. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1732.56s)]
*  And at the time you hate to be the conspiracy theorist. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you're [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1737.32s)]
*  familiar with your brand, but you are the conspiracy theorist. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1739.0s)]
*  At the time, I was like, wish you didn't smoke and wish you didn't drink. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1742.04s)]
*  Now, oh my God, I know a lot of people [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1747.24s)]
*  smoke and drink and they live forever. What the fuck's going on? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1748.76s)]
*  Why? Why did Christopher Hitchens die so young? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1751.56s)]
*  But then again, why did Hicks die so young? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1754.0s)]
*  Hicks died at like pancreatic cancer, like 33 or something. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1755.56s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think we can relate his death to this. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1759.52s)]
*  No, no, no. Of course not. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1761.32s)]
*  Of course not. But it's fun to do. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1762.84s)]
*  He's a writer. Oh, he's genius. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1764.32s)]
*  He was Hitch 22. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1766.28s)]
*  And there's a book that he wrote about politics, The Letters to a Young Contrarian. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1767.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1773.48s)]
*  It's like it's those bits of it's amazing [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1774.8799999999999s)]
*  things kind of books when people write their autobiography. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1778.56s)]
*  And it's like it just it's a gift. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1781.48s)]
*  It's just you can you can feel like you know them. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1785.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, you can also like imagine what would you do if you were living this person's life? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1787.3600000000001s)]

*  human beings when they're really open, they really let you in, you know, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1810.0400000000002s)]
*  which is one of the things I think reasons why we detest people that are [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1814.2s)]
*  very manufactured and closed off like, you know, the newscaster that you're never [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1819.72s)]

*  Oh, yeah. And it's it's playful. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1843.76s)]
*  And I think I mean, OK, this is my big theory on life. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1846.36s)]
*  I think play is like we don't. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1849.84s)]
*  Stop playing because we get old, we get old because we stop playing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1853.24s)]
*  Yes, and in our job, as George Bernard Shaw, I think, said it first anyway, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1857.3999999999999s)]
*  but he's wrong, you get old no matter what. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1862.32s)]
*  He's full of shit. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1864.8s)]
*  You're going to break a hip. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1865.9199999999998s)]
*  Follow that guy's advice. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1867.56s)]
*  You're going to fucking roll your ankle for sure. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1868.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but maybe playing Twister when you're 70. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1870.4399999999998s)]
*  Great. That's a good way to break a hip. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1872.88s)]
*  But that thing of like going play is sort of in short supply. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1874.92s)]
*  If you think about what anyone cares about, right? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1879.64s)]
*  Like people talk about sports all the time. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1882.3200000000002s)]
*  People talk about concerts and going to see music. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1884.44s)]
*  People love seeing comedy and they love this kind of thing. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1886.96s)]
*  But this is like play. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1891.0800000000002s)]
*  We're playing and sports is playing and theater is playing and comedy is playing. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1892.72s)]
*  And there's not enough play in life. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1897.5200000000002s)]
*  And really, I always think of that thing of like when I'm performing shows, [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1900.48s)]
*  like there's an illusion that it's me performing on stage. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1904.0s)]
*  But actually, everyone in the room is performing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1908.0s)]
*  It's a performative thing seeing a show. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1911.44s)]
*  If you think about when you last saw, I don't know, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1913.44s)]
*  Bruce Springsteen live and Bruce Springsteen goes, how are you all doing? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1916.16s)]
*  And the whole place goes, yeah. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1919.96s)]
*  If in Starbucks, someone goes, how are you doing? [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1922.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1924.8400000000001s)]
*  Psychotic. You get kicked out. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1926.88s)]
*  Right. The audience is doing their part. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1929.3200000000002s)]
*  They're doing their bit. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  And especially like in our game, in comedy, it's a feedback loop. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1932.3200000000002s)]
*  Everything is split tested. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1937.24s)]
*  Everything is how do you feel about that? [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1938.8000000000002s)]
*  And the one audience member know anything about comedy and jokes. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1940.88s)]
*  Get a hundred of them together. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1945.3600000000001s)]
*  Genius. They know exactly what's funny, what isn't funny, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1946.96s)]
*  what's acceptable, where the line is. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1949.8000000000002s)]
*  And you're getting that feedback the whole time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1952.16s)]
*  So like doing comedy, it's not it's not repetition. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1954.2s)]
*  It's iteration. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1957.0400000000002s)]
*  It's just that you're getting a constant sort of feedback from these these people. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1958.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a mind meld, right? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1962.56s)]
*  Yeah. And people want it because they want to come out because, you know, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1964.76s)]
*  it used to be we'd gather around a fire and do this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1969.56s)]
*  Right. And then we gathered around the wireless [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1972.72s)]
*  and we talked and then we gathered around the TV. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1976.64s)]
*  That's what you guys call the radio back in the wireless. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1979.4s)]
*  The wireless. That was what it was called. For real. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1981.8s)]

*  And we're alienated. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  We're more connected and less connected than ever. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=1997.56s)]

*  Unappreciated serenity. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2215.56s)]
*  Like travel, like I'm traveling a lot of the moment, I'm on tour. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2218.52s)]
*  And sometimes you're in an airport and there's nothing much going on. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2221.48s)]
*  Just chill. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2223.84s)]
*  Just sit. Yeah. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  Let something pop in and live. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2226.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2228.8s)]
*  Isn't it interesting? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2229.84s)]
*  It's like for creative types, especially that's very valuable to be able to have [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2230.84s)]
*  some time where you just come up with ideas, but instead you just flood them [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2236.1200000000003s)]
*  with nonsense, car accidents, boobs and [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2240.56s)]
*  fast cars. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2245.44s)]
*  Yeah. Just get just bombarded with overstimulated. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2246.84s)]
*  And very little of it gets in. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2250.6s)]
*  You know, if I think about like if I listen to a book on tape, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2252.96s)]
*  like a very interesting book on tape, that's one thing. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2256.52s)]
*  But if I'm just like doom scrolling, like how much good get how much like [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2259.0s)]
*  if I spend five hours of just looking at social media and looking at YouTube, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2264.96s)]
*  what amount of good stuff is in there? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2271.2400000000002s)]
*  Is there even 20 minutes of really fascinating shit that I absorb in the [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2274.6800000000003s)]
*  entire day? Are you familiar with the concept of Lindy books? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2278.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. Like the idea of like how long [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2282.28s)]
*  something's been around is how long it's going to be around. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2284.1600000000003s)]
*  So most stuff on the Internet was produced in the last 24 hours and will be [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2286.8s)]
*  entirely forgotten in 24 hours. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2291.4s)]
*  No one ever goes, oh, I've got to show you my favorite TikTok from two years ago. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2294.2s)]
*  Right. It just doesn't happen. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2298.44s)]
*  It's like if they do, they're crazy. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2299.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. It's disposable. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2301.72s)]
*  Oh, no, I got to get away from you. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2302.88s)]
*  Yeah. You want to show me old TikToks here. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  Fucking psycho. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But it's that's the nature of it. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2307.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2309.64s)]
*  But like it's crime and punishment is not addictive. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2310.68s)]
*  You know, the book, yeah, you know, but Twitter is. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2315.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Fascinating. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2319.4s)]
*  Right. Isn't it fascinating? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2320.72s)]
*  It's something like very valuable. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2322.0s)]
*  Some amazing piece of literature is not addictive. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2324.32s)]
*  You know. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2328.88s)]
*  I wonder. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2330.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder with that. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2332.1600000000003s)]
*  I wonder, is it the that thing of [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2333.32s)]
*  order sucks, like the idea that brave new world, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2336.96s)]
*  our power won't be taken from us by some overlords like in 1984 will give away our [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  power for cheap dopamine. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2347.84s)]
*  Yeah. And the problem with the world is there's a lot of cheap dopamine on on [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2349.84s)]
*  office. So, you know, doom scrolling or it's the same as the [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2355.0800000000004s)]
*  is in a casino. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2360.2000000000003s)]
*  And that but then there's real joy. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2362.0800000000004s)]
*  If you go out and see live comedy, I think what we we're drug dealers. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2364.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. Oh, yeah. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2367.48s)]
*  And the two drugs, it's dopamine and serotonin and the dopamine is you don't [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2368.2400000000002s)]
*  quite know where the punch line is coming. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2371.44s)]
*  You know, there's a punch line, but you don't know quite where it's going to be. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2372.8s)]
*  Right. And then there's the serotonin, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2375.5600000000004s)]
*  the joy of laughter as well. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2376.8s)]
*  And then you can get a fake version online or video games like a proxy for the career [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2378.92s)]
*  that the kid isn't having. Right. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2385.76s)]
*  There's levels and layers and then a big boss at the end. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2387.6000000000004s)]
*  It couldn't be a clear analogy or porn is a proxy for love and sex. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2390.0800000000004s)]
*  It's like we go for the easy option. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2396.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But actually, when you work for it, it's just better. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2398.32s)]
*  Right. The thing is, the easy option is available instantaneously. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2401.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's very difficult to go fight in war, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2405.4s)]
*  but you can play Call of Duty right now. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2408.04s)]
*  You just sit in front of your computer and then you're playing. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2410.52s)]
*  You know, so this cheap version might keep you from having a life of adventure [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2413.2400000000002s)]
*  because it's spoon feeds you bullshit versions of reality that are very addictive. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2418.36s)]
*  OK, so back to your work ethic. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2424.96s)]
*  So the idea that you don't do that, you spend time doing difficult things. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2427.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  Like the I got the cold plunge thing from listening to you. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2434.12s)]
*  I was kind of interested in it and kind of chat as friends. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2437.92s)]
*  I tried it and loved it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  But you're putting yourself in a very uncomfortable situation in order for benefits later. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2442.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2448.7599999999998s)]
*  Kind of a sacrifice you make in the moment for something later. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2449.36s)]
*  Yeah. What draws us to that? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2452.36s)]
*  What makes us do that? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2454.64s)]
*  The process. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2456.4s)]
*  So knowing that other people are completing this process and having positive results [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2457.48s)]
*  and then sort of investing a little bit of time into it, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2461.88s)]
*  either out of boredom or curiosity or whatever. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2464.84s)]
*  And then you realize, oh, this is real. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2467.4s)]
*  Like, this is real in terms of like fitness. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2469.52s)]
*  Like if you want to start running, you want to run a marathon. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2472.2400000000002s)]
*  You're like, that's impossible. I can't even run around the block. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2474.4s)]
*  Well, if you run around the block three days in a row, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2476.7200000000003s)]
*  you're going to get better running around the block. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2480.32s)]
*  And if you keep that up for a couple of months, you're like, holy shit, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2482.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm getting around this block pretty easy now. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2485.4s)]
*  And then you start expanding your runs. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2487.48s)]
*  And the next thing you're running a couple of miles a day. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2490.48s)]
*  The next thing you know, you're entering into a 5K. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2493.08s)]
*  And the next thing you know, you're running a half marathon. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2496.08s)]
*  And then you look back on that day where you couldn't even run around the block [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2498.92s)]
*  and you thought running was impossible. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2502.08s)]
*  So there's a process and there's a process of improvement. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2504.2s)]
*  But that process requires you to be uncomfortable. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2507.52s)]
*  And most people are unwilling to be uncomfortable. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2510.76s)]
*  So if you are willing to be uncomfortable, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2513.0s)]
*  you will bypass most human beings in everything you do. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2514.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's also it's that thing of like we [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2518.4s)]
*  like that prioritizing now. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2520.48s)]
*  Yeah, seems to be the if you can prioritize later, if you can sort of Chris [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2522.64s)]
*  Williamson gratification. Yeah. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2527.6s)]
*  Well, Chris Williamson's got this great thing we were chatting about it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2529.2s)]
*  Me and George, I love him. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2532.04s)]
*  It's amazing. He's great. He's the best. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2533.72s)]
*  But that thing of like 24 hours ahead, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2535.36s)]
*  we've all got to serve someone right in life. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2538.08s)]
*  You've got to serve and serving yourself in 24 hours is pretty good [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2540.8s)]
*  because it's that thing of like booze is the best example. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2545.52s)]
*  Like drinking is you're borrowing happiness from tomorrow. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2548.56s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2552.12s)]
*  So that in a very simple way, you know, like the reason also it's like [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2553.12s)]
*  predatory credit card rates, like the kind of rates that you get [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2556.56s)]
*  when you go to college and they give you a credit card and you're a moron. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2559.7599999999998s)]
*  And they get like 39 percent interest or something like that. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2562.52s)]
*  Something crazy. Yeah. That's what it's like. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2565.28s)]
*  It's like you're not just borrowing money. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2567.08s)]
*  Like your body's like, yeah, I'm going to need more. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2568.88s)]
*  I'm going to need more than you spent. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2571.8s)]
*  Yeah. I find that thing of like the it's [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2574.12s)]
*  whenever I feel anxious or depressed or any of those things, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2577.0s)]
*  I always sort of think it's invariably with me. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2581.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a hardware problem, not a software problem. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2584.0s)]
*  So it's like, OK, have I slept? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2587.04s)]
*  Have I exercised? Have I eaten correctly? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2589.6000000000004s)]
*  It's a good way to put it hardware, software. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2593.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you go, OK, this is a hardware problem. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2595.1600000000003s)]
*  But it's so hard to fix that when you're depressed. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2597.8s)]
*  It's so hard to like it's like it's all very well for us to go, well, you know, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2601.36s)]
*  go for a run and do some exercise and have a cold plunge. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2604.96s)]
*  It's so difficult when you're in that. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm very empathetic to that state. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2609.6000000000004s)]
*  And I wonder, does it help that we slightly pathologize in our language? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2611.36s)]
*  We say depressed and anxious, not sad and worried. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2616.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think for some people it's a listen, you don't want to. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2620.96s)]
*  You don't want to be trivialized mental health problems. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2624.48s)]
*  But you go sometimes it's just the human condition. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2626.4s)]
*  We're going to worry about stuff. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2628.8s)]
*  Certainly you don't want to trivialize mental health issues. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  However, you also understand that there's a tremendous benefit to being physically [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2633.44s)]
*  active that is actually better than SSRI, statistically speaking. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2641.0400000000004s)]
*  So what do you prescribe? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2645.6000000000004s)]
*  Is it better to prescribe drugs or is it better to be real with a person and say, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2648.2000000000003s)]
*  I know this is uncomfortable, but this is what you're going to have to do. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2652.4s)]
*  And it sucks, but it sucks for everybody. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2656.0800000000004s)]
*  And everybody has a test in life. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2658.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is your test, your test in life. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2659.8s)]
*  You know, your test in life is not to try to win the Super Bowl. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2662.3199999999997s)]
*  Your test in life is try to get up and not eat garbage today and drink a bunch [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2665.3599999999997s)]
*  of water and have some exercise. This is your test in life. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2670.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's it's not easy. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2672.8799999999997s)]
*  It's well, the issue is that you want to be, I think, kindness. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2675.24s)]
*  Right. Is in a kindness is it's the most wonderful thing. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2678.68s)]
*  And here's the problem with kindness. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2684.2s)]
*  There's a lot of kindness in the moment. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2686.3999999999996s)]
*  Like, I've got kids, you got kids, right? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2688.68s)]
*  Your kids want what do they want to do? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2690.6s)]
*  They want to eat McDonald's and they want to watch TV. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2691.96s)]
*  But and you want to be kind in the moment, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2694.36s)]
*  but you're going to have fat, stupid kids, of course. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2696.96s)]
*  So you go, well, let's have some healthy [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2699.96s)]
*  food and let's read some books and let's run around outside. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  And maybe they don't want to do that now. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2705.2s)]
*  But you've got to you've got to be kind to their potential. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2707.2s)]
*  Yes. Not just to. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2710.4s)]
*  And then you kind of obviously, you know, that it kind of teaches you that. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2711.96s)]
*  And then you kind of have to apply it to yourself because you go, well, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2715.84s)]
*  they're not going to pay attention to what I say. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2718.36s)]
*  They're just going to watch what I do. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2720.2400000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2721.9199999999996s)]
*  But then, you know, individuals that are struggling, you know, the problem is [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2723.2799999999997s)]
*  if you don't know them, you don't know, like what what are they going through? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2729.0s)]
*  Is this nonsense or is this like really serious? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2733.3999999999996s)]
*  Like if they had a really fucked up life [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2737.0s)]
*  or they just really self-indulgent and lazy, like what are we dealing with here? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2740.4399999999996s)]
*  Like, what are we dealing with? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2744.56s)]
*  Are we dealing with like tremendous depression because of like physical [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2745.56s)]
*  and sexual abuse and beatings and violence in the house? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2748.92s)]
*  Are we dealing with that or are we dealing with some kid who their parents [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2752.4s)]
*  doted on them too much and that maybe the parents were super negative, which is very [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2757.12s)]
*  that is very contagious. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2763.96s)]
*  Like if you have like very negative family members and then everybody in the family [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2765.56s)]
*  is always complaining, it's always something's wrong and someone did something to them. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2769.4s)]
*  And so there's no joy. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2774.12s)]
*  I don't think I don't think you realize. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2775.6800000000003s)]
*  Maybe you do. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2777.8s)]
*  I don't think you realize how much you help people. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2778.48s)]
*  I'm like having these conversations on here. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2781.36s)]
*  They help me. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2783.64s)]
*  I think they help all of us. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2784.36s)]
*  We're all human beings. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2785.52s)]
*  We all go through weird shit just being a person. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2786.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's not easy. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2790.2000000000003s)]
*  And but having these conversations and I think there's something about [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2791.28s)]
*  you specifically, like [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2795.12s)]
*  the martial arts stuff, the it's a very alpha thing. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2798.2400000000002s)]
*  And then your stand up comedian and very admired by your peers. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2802.0s)]
*  And you can have conversations about this stuff. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2806.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it really cuts through to a group that wouldn't hear that. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2809.2s)]
*  I mean, for me, that that thing that you're saying there is about it's about agency [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2813.44s)]
*  and empathy, and I think there's a problem in our society that we give agency to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2817.36s)]
*  people we don't like and we give empathy to people that we do like. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2823.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, so if there's like a right wing Nazi rally, we say they knew what they were [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2828.52s)]
*  doing, we give them agency, we punish them. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  Elon Musk with the Hitler salute. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2836.28s)]
*  Right. OK, so we say he knew what he was doing. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2838.12s)]
*  OK. And then if we really like someone, we give them empathy and yes, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2840.84s)]
*  that's a great, great example and sympathy. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2845.48s)]
*  And the issue is we need to give everyone both. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2848.36s)]
*  Yes, because you go, look, no one is going to care about you more than you. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2852.2400000000002s)]
*  You need to take responsibility for this. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2858.1600000000003s)]
*  And you need to, you know, do you know, it's very, very tough. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2861.12s)]
*  Because you want to be you want to give that agency and empathy to everyone, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2866.04s)]
*  to give them the tools to. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2871.2400000000002s)]
*  Have a better life. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2874.0s)]
*  Yeah, and the more happy people are, the more happy people there will be. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2874.92s)]
*  It'll expand. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2878.4s)]
*  It's not like it's it's not one plus one equals two. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2879.56s)]
*  It just it's exponential. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2883.76s)]
*  It accelerates the more people are happy and enjoying their life, the more you will [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2885.52s)]
*  enjoy your life. And that's just part of a community. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2890.8s)]
*  It's the natural human reward system that's set up to make sure that we all get [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2893.92s)]
*  along together and we continue to procreate and have a wonderful society until we meld [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2897.92s)]
*  with the machine, which is coming any day now. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2903.1200000000003s)]
*  I hope you're ready. I don't know. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2905.1200000000003s)]
*  You want to hear my heart take on AI? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2906.84s)]
*  I would love to. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2908.28s)]
*  All right. My heart take on AI is we were not made in God's image, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2909.4s)]
*  but we so wanted there to be a God. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2913.92s)]
*  We made one in our image. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2916.76s)]
*  So if you think about the attributes of AI, it's all knowing, all powerful, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2918.88s)]
*  can perform miracles. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2925.48s)]
*  It lives in a cloud. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2927.2400000000002s)]
*  Sorry, is that God or AI? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2929.4s)]
*  Wow. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2930.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's so at the moment, I think it's an emerging God. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2932.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, it's done growing yet. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2936.76s)]
*  At the moment, it's the Oracle of Delphi. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2938.92s)]
*  It's like a 10 year old right now, though. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2941.04s)]
*  It's not even an adult. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2942.8s)]
*  Yeah. And then where's it going to? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2944.04s)]
*  So the idea of like the interesting thing [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2946.44s)]
*  about AI is it's the gap between me and who's the smartest guy we know, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2948.5600000000004s)]
*  Eric Weinstein used to be enormous. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2954.0400000000004s)]
*  And the gap is getting smaller because AI can just I can ask it. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2957.48s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, bitch, I got all the answers right here. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2961.36s)]
*  Yeah. It's weird what's going on. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2964.0s)]
*  You know, I had a gag about it, about, you know, like a bit about in our [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2966.28s)]
*  universities, you know, the students are using AI to write their essays. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2971.0s)]
*  And then the tutors are using AI to mark the essays. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2973.88s)]
*  And then after three years, AI gets the job. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2977.12s)]
*  It actually seems very fair. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2980.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably what's going to happen. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2982.44s)]
*  What you're saying is very funny. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2985.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like it is accurate, though. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2986.88s)]
*  It does seem to resemble a God. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2989.12s)]
*  Well, I wonder, you know, who Marshall McLuhan is? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  Of course, the Canadian great lines of all time. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2994.48s)]
*  Human beings are the sex organs of the machine world. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=2998.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I get like 10. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3004.6s)]
*  Yeah, that one gives and I think that I gave a shortened version of it. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3006.84s)]
*  I think it's even longer, but it's fascinating because it's it's so never [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3013.56s)]
*  more true than today, never more true. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3018.56s)]
*  Like if we are really giving birth to AI. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3021.2000000000003s)]
*  This is what I wonder what will change. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3024.92s)]
*  I wonder, I'm very optimistic, right. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3026.44s)]
*  So 120 years ago, 95 percent of the population worked in agriculture. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3028.8s)]
*  And they worked 16 hours a day. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3033.68s)]
*  And it was a very, very tough life. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3035.76s)]
*  And then we moved to the cities and we worked in factories and, you know, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3038.32s)]
*  the unions, they don't get the credit they deserve. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3044.04s)]
*  They gave us the weekend. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3046.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And now we think human beings work five days and we have two days off. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3047.4s)]
*  That's how that's the world. Right. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3051.6s)]
*  But it's it's different. It's changing now. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3053.72s)]
*  It's like it's going to change again. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3056.48s)]
*  And we'll look back and go. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3059.96s)]
*  And when we're incredibly privileged that we're born right now and here it is, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3061.3999999999996s)]
*  man becomes, as it were, the sex organs and machine world as the bee of the plant [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  world enable it to fiscundicate and evolve ever new forms. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3070.64s)]
*  Oh, fiscundate rather, machine world [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3075.72s)]
*  reciprocates man's love by expediting his wishes and desires, namely in providing [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3078.68s)]
*  him with wealth, it's not as eloquent as the sex organs. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3083.4799999999996s)]
*  I think I think you nailed it. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3087.56s)]
*  My version of it's a little better. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3089.56s)]
*  Come on, it's his words. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3091.16s)]
*  I think we're the electronic caterpillar that's going to become a butterfly. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3093.6s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3097.6s)]
*  I think we're giving birth to a new form of life. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3098.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what I think we're doing. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3100.7999999999997s)]
*  I love that thing with that book, The Beginning of Infinity. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3102.32s)]
*  I can't get over that. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3105.92s)]
*  What book is that? Who wrote that? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3107.12s)]
*  It's a beginning of infinity. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3109.0s)]
*  I think it's David Deutsch and it's the can you show the beginning of the book. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3111.32s)]
*  So the idea of the beginning of infinity is that if we can get through this. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3116.8799999999997s)]
*  Phase in humanity, right, there's been 100 billion people so far, 110 billion, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3122.68s)]
*  there's nine billion at the moment, eight billion, nine billion. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3128.0s)]
*  If we can get through this, if we get off planet. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3130.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe there are trillions of people in the future, trillions, right? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3134.48s)]
*  Maybe humanity spreads out across the galaxies [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3139.04s)]
*  and the universe for the next 13 billion years. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3142.2799999999997s)]
*  Like the idea that if we can get through this now, this little phase that we're in, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3145.24s)]
*  we're having a little bit of difficulty here with a couple of possible problems. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3149.68s)]
*  And if we can get through it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3154.12s)]
*  Like the the the science, the scientific meme, the idea that we've created [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3156.48s)]
*  these machines, but really through through science, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3162.88s)]
*  like the technology that we have is brilliant. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3166.64s)]
*  And if we can negotiate, if we can have a little bit of peace. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3171.16s)]
*  If we can avoid the war. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3174.44s)]
*  Yeah, if we can avoid the war and really, you know, avoiding the war, I think is, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3175.44s)]
*  I think is possible. I think the most are his. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3179.52s)]
*  Here's the take. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3182.04s)]
*  I think the most incredible piece of technology that we have, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3183.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm very optimistic about the world, like you could look at the state of the world [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3187.48s)]
*  and go, it's terrible. But I look at like I look at America. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3190.1600000000003s)]
*  I look at the UK and I look at the footfall. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3193.36s)]
*  So what do people want to come? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3196.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, they want to come and they want to live here. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3198.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3201.1600000000003s)]
*  And what's the most important piece of technology in America? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3202.0s)]
*  I would argue the Constitution, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3205.0s)]
*  the Constitution, you sort of don't think of it as a piece of technology, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3208.08s)]
*  but it really is. And it's allowed all of this. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3210.96s)]
*  An operating system. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3214.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a brilliant operating system. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3215.32s)]
*  You can prove that culture is downstream of institutions and freedom because you go [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3216.84s)]
*  look at OK, here's the great examples, right? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  East and West Germany, North and South Korea, right. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3226.4s)]
*  Exactly the same people, right. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3229.08s)]
*  Exactly the same culturally. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3231.0s)]
*  And they got this system. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3233.1200000000003s)]
*  They got this system. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3234.92s)]
*  East and West Germany. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3236.04s)]
*  You got the stars over here. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3236.96s)]
*  Hell on earth. North Korea. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3238.6400000000003s)]
*  Whatever the fuck is going on there. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3240.28s)]
*  And then you get South Korea. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3242.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, flourishing, right. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3243.52s)]
*  Incredible culture. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3245.0s)]
*  You get West Germany. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3246.32s)]
*  I got another one. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3248.1600000000003s)]
*  Kraftwerk, Cuba and Miami. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3249.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's exactly right. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3251.76s)]
*  Ninety miles away. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3255.1600000000003s)]
*  OK, so here's the thing. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3256.6400000000003s)]
*  How many people in the world now? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3257.52s)]
*  Nine billion, eight billion. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3258.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a lot. Something right. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3259.92s)]
*  Half a billion. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3261.32s)]
*  OK, so there's there's the UK, there's the US, there's Canada, there's Australia. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3262.6800000000003s)]
*  OK, they're all, I mean, ex British colonies. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3268.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3272.0s)]
*  I'll take the win. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3273.36s)]
*  But but those institutions, those institutions are [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  set up in a certain way that's allowed a flourishing where people want to come here. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3280.36s)]
*  Yeah. OK, so either we accept nine billion people [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3285.52s)]
*  into our countries or we export our institutions. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3289.88s)]
*  I think we should be we should be writing [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3296.0s)]
*  or coming up with great constitutions for nations that we want to see in the future. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3299.36s)]
*  You and I think very much alike. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3304.2000000000003s)]
*  I've said the same thing. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3305.76s)]
*  I said the thing, the highlight when people are talking about [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3307.08s)]
*  immigration into this country, one of the big ones is wouldn't you do this [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3312.92s)]
*  if you were in another world? Of course, of course I would. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3317.1200000000003s)]
*  If I lived in the third world country [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3319.24s)]
*  and I had a chance to make a better life and come to America, 100 percent I would do it. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3321.0s)]
*  But the the real question is why is it so bad over there? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3325.2799999999997s)]
*  And what can we do to make that better? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3328.72s)]
*  Instead of bringing them in here to make their lives better. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3330.3599999999997s)]
*  Why not make the whole world? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3333.9599999999996s)]
*  It's possible to make the whole. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3336.16s)]
*  The only problem with that is you lose your cheap labor. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3337.52s)]
*  OK, well, I mean, it's the it's the right wing in America. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3339.6s)]
*  The you know, the idea of going, OK, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3343.72s)]
*  we're going to get rid of the southern border to bring in cheap labor. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3346.68s)]
*  Is a crazy idea, because all we're doing is where, you know, we outsource [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3349.24s)]
*  and this problem has been what is was ever thus. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3354.48s)]
*  George Orwell was once asked, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3357.24s)]
*  what do you think of the British working classes? [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3358.88s)]
*  And he said they live in India. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3361.36s)]
*  Smart guy. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3366.72s)]
*  But you go globalisation, the idea of going along with tech help. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3367.68s)]
*  But it's the idea of we go, we often export our our [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3371.12s)]
*  the things that we're conscious about. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3374.88s)]
*  So we go, OK, so we we we shut down all the coal mines in the UK [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3376.88s)]
*  and now we import coal. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3381.5600000000004s)]
*  OK, is that I mean, it's one better. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3384.6000000000004s)]
*  It's one world we live in. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3387.0s)]

*  Agency and empathy on a global scale. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3442.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like giving those nations that are in horrific trouble and that no [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3446.08s)]
*  one seems to care about agency. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3451.72s)]

*  I don't know where it was written, but it was like [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3457.92s)]
*  I think it was like intellectuals from around the world were like chipping in [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3460.7599999999998s)]
*  with ideas and they came up with this incredible document. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3463.64s)]
*  And look at the flourishing that's come out of it. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3468.16s)]
*  Look at what it's achieved. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3470.08s)]
*  Like imagine if. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3471.88s)]
*  Imagine if something like that happens in China. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3474.28s)]
*  Imagine in our lifetime that they go with a different system and it's more [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3477.12s)]
*  because at the moment, China is kind of, you know, it's a covers band. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3482.0s)]
*  You know, it doesn't it takes a lot of intellectual property and it has its own [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3486.48s)]
*  version of Facebook and its own version of Google and its own version of. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3489.96s)]
*  But it doesn't. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3494.36s)]
*  What is it about America that that that allows this entrepreneurial spirit that [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3495.88s)]
*  allowed Silicon Valley to happen? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3501.04s)]
*  Well, they've got an interesting approach because they still have a very [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3502.76s)]
*  entrepreneurial spirit as well. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3506.0s)]
*  They've got a weird sort of a merging of communism and capitalism. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3507.76s)]
*  Like it's state run capitalism. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3514.28s)]
*  But they still have insane innovation. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3517.24s)]
*  Like China's technological innovation is [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3520.08s)]
*  probably greater than ours in a lot of areas, in the areas of electric vehicles, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3522.76s)]
*  for sure, in the areas of drones, for sure. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3527.88s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, but there there was some sort of a mothership drone [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3532.64s)]
*  that they're going to launch that is this enormous vehicle that can that drones can [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3536.68s)]
*  launch off of. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3543.44s)]
*  And OK, I mean, this feels like. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3544.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3547.7200000000003s)]
*  It's like they they have some spectacular drone capabilities and they also have [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3549.0400000000004s)]
*  electric cars that if you don't follow these obscure car review people online [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3556.1600000000003s)]
*  that review Chinese electric cars, you'd have no idea. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3562.6800000000003s)]
*  These cars are insane. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3565.6400000000003s)]
*  They have cars that do like a 360. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3567.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it'll sit there parked and it'll just spin in a circle if you want to. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3570.1200000000003s)]
*  So if you want to take a U-turn instead of having to go all the way around, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3573.8799999999997s)]
*  your car would just spin around in a circle and go back the other way. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3577.16s)]
*  Weird stuff, man, like insane technology inside the vehicles, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3580.7999999999997s)]
*  like spectacular looking cars. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3585.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah, they're they're on the verge of, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3589.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, passing us in many areas because there's a lot of regulation in regards to [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3593.08s)]
*  drone technology in particular in this country. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3599.68s)]
*  If you want to be a drone pilot, is that going to is that going to change now? [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3602.8s)]
*  I don't know. Ukraine. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3606.36s)]
*  I mean, that's the first drone war. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3607.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know. It's all scary. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3609.4s)]
*  You know, the drone thing is weird because if you allow everyone to have drones, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3611.96s)]
*  like you get that sometimes where like you see people deal with drones over their [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3616.76s)]
*  house. Like, is that legal? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3620.76s)]
*  Can you just fly over my fucking house with a drone? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3622.0s)]
*  Turns out it is. Turns out it is legal. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3624.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, how much of it as well? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3626.48s)]
*  Like, I mean, talking to the right guy here, but how much of the alien stuff [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3627.6000000000004s)]
*  that we watched in the 1950s and 60s was that technology being tested in America? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3631.68s)]
*  This is the drone mothership. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3637.04s)]
*  This is the drone mothership that China's created. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3638.52s)]
*  So this is enormous ship that can send thousands of drones. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3642.28s)]
*  Do you think it would be sensible for you and I to pledge allegiance to the Chinese [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3648.4s)]
*  Communist Party now sort of sort of on the record? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3653.52s)]
*  We should learn just in case. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3655.88s)]
*  I think it's a good time to learn Mandarin. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3657.48s)]
*  I think. Wow. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3659.16s)]
*  John Cena was right. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3660.3999999999996s)]
*  Look at that. 25 meters wide. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3661.7599999999998s)]

*  That's big. Yeah. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3667.92s)]
*  I mean, it feels like the quarter of a football field. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3671.08s)]
*  I don't know. So it's war is changing, isn't it? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3674.68s)]
*  I mean, it's yeah. But it used to be I suppose it's always changing. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3677.24s)]

*  We'll wear red. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3683.04s)]
*  We'll line up and then we'll just smash it out. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3684.12s)]
*  And there was those days are over. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3687.24s)]
*  But there was no civilian casualties. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3689.04s)]
*  It kind of worked. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3690.6800000000003s)]
*  And then there's guerrilla warfare and there's what's going on now. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3691.7200000000003s)]

*  OK. OK. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3698.6400000000003s)]

*  I think they do, too. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3709.44s)]
*  But there was very little information available. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3710.6800000000003s)]
*  And we're we're hoping there'll be more [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3713.44s)]
*  information now that [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3716.16s)]
*  Cash Patel and Dan Bongino are in the FBI. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3718.8399999999997s)]
*  But I'm not I saw them recently talk about Epstein. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3722.56s)]
*  They're saying that Epstein was he definitely committed suicide. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3726.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm like, definitely. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3729.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, because especially like [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3730.96s)]
*  Bongino. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3734.4s)]
*  But, you know, it's the terrible kind of [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3735.44s)]
*  the lag from Covid. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3738.7999999999997s)]
*  The you know, the long Covid [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3741.12s)]
*  from a psychological perspective is trust. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3743.64s)]
*  We've lost a lot of trust because anyone that said it was a lab leak at the time [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3747.2000000000003s)]

*  Yeah. Well, it's also it's way worse than [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3758.2400000000002s)]
*  it was a concerted effort that was coordinated. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3761.0s)]
*  And you could follow the paper trail now. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3764.52s)]
*  Like what used to be a conspiracy theory is now just facts like that. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3767.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, there was one thing that came out where [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3771.6s)]
*  what's the difference between a conspiracy theory and a fact is five years now. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3776.12s)]
*  Find out who did it was Yale. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3779.7200000000003s)]
*  Yale did a study before the vaccine was even released, where they were [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3782.12s)]
*  running the effects of shaming people to try to coerce them into taking a [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3791.6s)]
*  medication to decrease vaccine hesitancy. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3799.56s)]
*  And I think there was they were running terms like trust the science. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3802.84s)]
*  It's it's crazy because it's the it's the baby in the bathwater because they [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3807.44s)]
*  they did that and then you go and then there's there's going to be more measles [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3812.36s)]
*  in America and more kids wearing glasses that thick and going deaf from measles [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3816.7999999999997s)]
*  because they're not taking the good vaccine. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3820.7999999999997s)]
*  So it's it's for me, it's like that idea of trust is such a you know, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3823.4s)]
*  when we talk about institutions and the Constitution and the checks and balances [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3828.32s)]
*  and we need trust in our society, that's one of the great things that came out of [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3833.76s)]
*  again, that's the Catholic Church. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3837.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, the real problem in this country when it comes to things like vaccines is [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3839.2400000000002s)]
*  we have narratives and we have narratives that all of them are bad. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3843.6800000000003s)]
*  We have narratives that all of them are good. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3847.4s)]
*  And trusting the science, we have these it gets strange. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3849.4s)]
*  Yeah. And then when the real problem in [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3853.8s)]
*  this country happened, when they absolved all pharmaceutical drug companies from any [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3856.36s)]
*  sort of liability for vaccines and they did that because vaccines have side effects, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3862.36s)]
*  even if they are effective, they have side effects. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3869.2400000000002s)]
*  It's part of the good and bad about them. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3871.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there's going to be some people that have. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3874.56s)]
*  So they were getting so many lawsuits [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3876.44s)]
*  that they were threatening to no longer produce vaccines. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3878.7200000000003s)]
*  So during the Reagan administration, he gave them blanket immunity. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3882.2000000000003s)]
*  And then they started doing things like prescribing hepatitis B shots to babies, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3885.04s)]
*  which doesn't make any fucking sense. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3890.64s)]
*  It's a sexually transmitted disease you get from dirty needles and sex. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3892.56s)]
*  And you're giving that vaccine to babies. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3896.28s)]
*  And it's kind of dangerous. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3898.56s)]
*  And they did it because people weren't taking it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3900.04s)]
*  And so then you get a thing where you're just trying to profit more. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3902.68s)]
*  And because you have this blanket [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3906.88s)]
*  immunity, you're taking advantage of this position, which is what corporations do. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3908.48s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're motivated by profit. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3913.0s)]
*  Here's the simple solution, like super simple ban advertising for medications. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3915.8s)]
*  Only it's New Zealand and America. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3923.56s)]
*  Yep. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3925.84s)]
*  That allow pharmaceuticals to be advertised. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3926.8s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3929.32s)]
*  And you go, well, what are we doing? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3929.96s)]
*  It's unnecessary. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3931.76s)]
*  Well, the real dark part of that is not [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3933.0s)]
*  that people get influence to try these [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3936.08s)]
*  medications or to trust in these medications because of the advertisement. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3938.32s)]
*  The real problem is it's such an immense part of the network's revenue that they [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3942.24s)]
*  will no longer do investigations on vaccine side effects or pharmaceutical drug [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3947.56s)]
*  side effects or do stories about things like Vioxx. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3954.04s)]
*  We got it all from the market. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3957.6s)]
*  We've got a killing. We've got to. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3958.6s)]
*  Thousand plus people. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3960.12s)]
*  We've got to motivate those companies. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3960.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. It can't just be the product because it's like the thing that I worry about is [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3962.72s)]
*  antibiotics, right? So antibiotics are what an incredible piece of technology. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3967.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3971.0s)]
*  People used to die from a fucking rusty nail. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3971.6800000000003s)]
*  Snagged them. And they would die. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3973.88s)]
*  Right. So modern medicine has given we have to look at what's what the positive side is. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3975.12s)]
*  There's an immense positive side. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3980.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3982.0s)]
*  Pharmaceutical drugs. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3982.76s)]
*  Talking to a man in his 50s with a hair transplant. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3984.0s)]
*  I've had a bit of work done. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3986.56s)]
*  Don't even start me on the Viagra. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3988.4s)]
*  I've got a lot to be thankful for for medical science. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3989.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3992.6800000000003s)]
*  So I big pharma. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3993.08s)]
*  Great. They've done a lot of good. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3994.32s)]
*  And then and then other stuff. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3995.8s)]
*  The antibiotics. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=3998.04s)]
*  But there's there's there's things that are resistant now to antibiotics. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4000.04s)]
*  They need new antibiotics, but there's nothing in it for the pharmaceutical [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4003.44s)]
*  companies to invest in that. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4007.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think that at a governmental level needs to be look, give them the money to do it. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4008.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. If you have oversight to make sure there's not fraud and waste and that is a [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4013.84s)]
*  problem when you give people money. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4017.7200000000003s)]
*  But the what you're saying is 100 percent true. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4019.28s)]
*  There's undeniable good that comes from pharmaceutical drugs. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4022.4s)]
*  The problem is not scientists and not medical science. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4027.3599999999997s)]
*  So you have medical scientists that are [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4032.48s)]
*  constantly trying to figure out new ways to stop Parkinson's disease, new ways to [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4034.3599999999997s)]
*  cure cancer. All this is wonderful. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4038.44s)]
*  But then you have the money, people. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4040.7599999999998s)]
*  How do we get this out there and how do we maybe we get this out there before it's [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4042.72s)]
*  ready and maybe we just fucking tell people it's ready when it's not. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4046.2s)]
*  Maybe you fudge a few tests. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4049.68s)]
*  Maybe you run some really fucking sneaky [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4051.52s)]
*  studies where you're only analyzing things in a certain very particular lens [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4054.8s)]
*  because you want them to be shown to be effective. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4060.2400000000002s)]
*  But you go, you know, and I don't mind people. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4063.48s)]
*  If someone comes up with a cure for cancer, they should profit. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4066.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't mind if they could be a trillionaire. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4068.92s)]
*  But the thing is, they're never satisfied when you have a publicly traded company. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4070.76s)]
*  They never are satisfied. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4075.28s)]
*  They never go, guys, we're doing great. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4076.76s)]
*  If we just make this amount of money every year, like that's wonderful. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4078.84s)]
*  Let's just like let's hang back. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4082.52s)]
*  I think our profits are very high. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4084.64s)]
*  Let's do good. Let's try to do the most amount of good. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4086.28s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4089.0s)]
*  It's an interesting thing where socialism has become such a dirty word. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4089.96s)]
*  But everyone agrees to some extent, right? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4094.8s)]
*  There's areas of life where you go where there has to be a level of [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4097.96s)]
*  socialism. So contribution. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4104.88s)]
*  We have to contribute. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4106.72s)]
*  OK, the fire service is great. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4107.6s)]
*  I use the same one all the time. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4109.24s)]
*  But you go. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4110.68s)]
*  Everyone agrees, right? OK, if your house burns down, we're going to have a fire [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4111.64s)]
*  service and it comes and it's it's not like, oh, we don't take care of that. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4114.280000000001s)]
*  Public education. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4117.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I think education, I think we could get there sooner because you look at some [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4118.68s)]
*  of the stuff that's available online now and it's just it's incredible. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4122.04s)]
*  It's like it's there. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4126.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I slightly think on education that we should. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4128.0s)]
*  Do do the right thing, right? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4132.88s)]
*  Instead of pumping the economy by printing more money and quantitative easing, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4134.400000000001s)]
*  I think America and the UK should cancel all student debt because we miss old [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4139.44s)]
*  people some bullshit degrees, right? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4146.5599999999995s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4149.24s)]
*  And the idea that student debt. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4150.04s)]
*  Right. So you're taking those people that took a chance and they went to university [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4152.639999999999s)]
*  and they gave their time and they studied hard. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4155.76s)]
*  And there's there's a theory that woke came out of elite overproduction. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4158.4s)]
*  So they people did everything right. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4165.0s)]
*  I went to school. They studied hard. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4167.96s)]
*  I went to university. They studied hard. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4169.28s)]
*  They got a degree and then they they can't buy a house. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4171.0s)]
*  They can't because, you know, maybe maybe the degree doesn't grow corn. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4175.0s)]
*  It's not in a STEM subject. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4178.6s)]
*  It's in the humanities or something. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4180.6s)]
*  And then they don't get the lifestyle that they worked hard for. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4182.04s)]
*  I think we cancel their debt. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4185.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to sound like a communist here, but free education is not [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4188.360000000001s)]

*  Like you got to always listen when that guy is ready to drop a gem. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4573.84s)]
*  That's a gem because as a comic, no one's telling you what to do. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4577.72s)]
*  You're responsible for yourself. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4581.5599999999995s)]
*  It's interesting. I did Kill Tony last night with [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4583.48s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe, who's at once the meanest motherfucker in the world [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4587.32s)]
*  and also the kindest man in comedy. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4592.12s)]
*  Yeah, because you look at the careers that he's launching like every every three, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4594.5199999999995s)]
*  four weeks, he's launching like a new name and then they're touring and they're [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4598.92s)]
*  playing clubs and they're having a great time. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4602.16s)]
*  And it's it's that thing of like you can't beat your environment. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4603.96s)]
*  So to be around people, not just that you like, but that you want to be like. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4608.04s)]
*  Sure. So you're creating this little thing, this little space like the [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4612.5599999999995s)]
*  the mothership's got this little community around it now of people that they want to [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4617.12s)]
*  get better and they're looking around and it's you know, you came here because [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4621.28s)]
*  Ron White was here, right? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4625.84s)]
*  I mean, in in no small part, a big part. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4627.44s)]
*  And then you built this thing and it's it's field of dreams. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4630.24s)]
*  Look how many people are coming. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4634.96s)]
*  And then I'm very excited to see in 20 years. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4636.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Who comes out of the scene? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4640.08s)]
*  I've just I actually flew in on Sunday to go down and see Chappelle. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4641.44s)]
*  So I went to see his new club in Yellow Springs. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4645.0s)]
*  I heard it's great. I mean, it's insane. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4648.08s)]
*  But that club only exists when he's there, right? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4651.12s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's only like he runs shows when he wants to run shows. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4653.56s)]
*  I think it's going to become something more than that. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4657.36s)]
*  I think it's I think that's what he's he's planted a seed there. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4660.12s)]
*  Yeah. And I think it's going to grow and it's a small town, but it's a town with a lot of pull. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4663.56s)]
*  It's almost too beautiful a town. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4669.04s)]
*  Yellow Springs, you kind of walk through and go, it's like the Stepford Wives. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4671.32s)]
*  It's like so perfect. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4674.96s)]
*  You know who's got playing this weekend? [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4676.84s)]
*  Who? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4678.44s)]
*  The whole of the Wu Tang Clan. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4679.0s)]
*  It's a 220 seater. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4681.8s)]
*  OK, I think it may be one of the few occasions where more people are on stage than off stage. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4683.76s)]
*  The audience may be smaller than the band. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4689.96s)]
*  Yeah, Wu Tang can stack it in there. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4692.360000000001s)]
*  That should be wild. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4695.0s)]
*  That'd be amazing. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4696.96s)]
*  It's going to be. Yeah, that's Dave. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4698.08s)]
*  He's but he draws people. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4699.4800000000005s)]
*  He's a magnet. You know, he really is. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4701.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he's a beautiful person. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4704.24s)]
*  Very, very unusual human being. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4705.8s)]
*  I don't know anybody like him. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4707.56s)]
*  No, he's a he's a unique. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4709.0s)]
*  Well, as are you. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4711.080000000001s)]
*  You're non fungible human beings. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4712.04s)]
*  There's no one else you go. He's a bit like that. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4715.160000000001s)]
*  No, it's just he's his own thing. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4717.0s)]
*  It's a wonderful thing. There's a there's a real I think in comedy. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4719.0s)]
*  That thing where we're out for ourselves, but in it together. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4723.64s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4727.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Alan Havy told me that. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4728.6s)]
*  And I remember thinking it's kind of true because we're all in this business. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4730.160000000001s)]
*  And there's like sometimes you see comics [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4733.64s)]
*  arguing or, you know, shit talking other comics online or something. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4736.16s)]
*  You go, what are you doing? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4739.5599999999995s)]
*  There's the narcissism of small differences [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4740.96s)]
*  where people go, oh, I don't like his observational stuff or he's hacky or so. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4744.48s)]
*  You go, we're all in the same business. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4748.72s)]
*  Yeah. Most of those people are just jealous. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4750.639999999999s)]
*  That's just a pettiness. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4752.5199999999995s)]
*  It's always people that they think of success that they don't deserve. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4753.8s)]
*  No one ever hates you for doing worse than them. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4757.84s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah, exactly. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4759.8s)]
*  It's all silly. It's really silly. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4761.88s)]
*  It's foolish. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4763.68s)]
*  And unfortunately, some of them are good comics, too, that are doing it. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4764.4s)]
*  It's like they put that on me friends. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4766.92s)]
*  They're islands. Right. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4768.679999999999s)]
*  And one of the ways that I describe comics, I go, you're either like a village [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4770.32s)]
*  or an island and villages do way better than islands. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4773.92s)]
*  So an island is a man on his own out there that does his own shows and doesn't has [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4777.5199999999995s)]
*  an opening act and doesn't hang out with comics. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4783.719999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of those guys. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4786.2s)]
*  And unfortunately, they they have the same opening act that that guy that becomes [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4787.24s)]
*  his job. He's just an opening act now. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4791.24s)]
*  And he only works when he works with the headliner. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4793.04s)]
*  And then they travel around the country and the guy never. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4795.36s)]
*  And then you watch the act deteriorate. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4798.32s)]
*  You watch the act start to fall apart and get soft. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4800.5199999999995s)]
*  This is this is what you know, it's the great thing you've done is it thrown down [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4803.28s)]
*  a rope bridge up there and you throw down the bridge and you bring people with you. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4807.32s)]
*  Well, what we did is create a real workshop [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4812.08s)]
*  in a real community where there's an actual path like there's a path from open [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4815.92s)]
*  mic night, which we had we have two nights a week to becoming a door person [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4820.8s)]
*  where you can get spots occasionally and you'll be watched by the best talent [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4825.320000000001s)]
*  coordinator in the world, Adam Adam Egan. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4829.88s)]
*  He's he's the best. He's the best. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4832.320000000001s)]
*  He's in Hawaii this week. I'm missing him. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4833.8s)]
*  Oh, well, he'll be back. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4835.24s)]
*  No, he's he's coming to London to see Oasis with me. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4837.16s)]
*  Oh, is he really? Oh, wow. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4839.360000000001s)]
*  That should be incredible. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4840.92s)]
*  Oh, we're going to don't they hate each other. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4842.28s)]
*  They hate each other with the touring together. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4843.64s)]
*  Nolan, the alligators. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4845.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I think there's a I think there's a lot of money as there's an amount [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4846.08s)]
*  of money you can put down and go, you should get Noel on this show. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4849.44s)]
*  I would love to know is so fun. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4852.36s)]
*  I love them. I love them. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4855.24s)]
*  But so the back to the mothership, the thing about it is we set it up to be a [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4857.36s)]
*  place where people can develop and show them a path. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4864.48s)]
*  And then there's Kiltoni, which is the perfect anchor of the entire community, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4867.28s)]
*  because it killed Tony. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4872.36s)]
*  You get to watch people that do their first time ever on stage or maybe they came [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4873.72s)]
*  from Seattle. They've been kind of struggling for five years and they do a one [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4879.5599999999995s)]
*  minute on stage and all of a sudden they get a Golden ticket. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4882.68s)]
*  And then also they become a regular on the show. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4884.92s)]
*  And then also they're selling out over the country. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4887.0s)]
*  And then you're in this group of people [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4889.4s)]
*  that are really enthusiastic about this art form that I think is one of the most [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4891.32s)]
*  underappreciated, yet very respected and very loved art forms. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4894.84s)]
*  It's really paradoxical because on one hand it's dismissed as being like a bunch [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4900.28s)]
*  of fools and the other hand, it's like everybody wants to go see a good one. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4905.32s)]
*  Yeah. Who's it who's dismissed by? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4909.08s)]
*  I mean, it is that thing where you go. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4911.12s)]
*  It's I think because it's a sense of humor is whatever that there's that great [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4912.72s)]
*  quote of laughter is the shortest distance between two people. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4918.32s)]
*  I think there's a real connection to comics [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4921.36s)]
*  because you laugh with your friends and your family and you laugh with this [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4923.48s)]
*  comedian. And if you think about friendship, I think about friendship like [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4927.24s)]
*  filters. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4933.08s)]
*  If you sit next to someone on a plane, you've got a lot of filters. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4934.599999999999s)]
*  Right. You chat about the weather or the local sports team, whatever. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4937.04s)]
*  And then you get really close to someone. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4939.8s)]
*  You've got no filters. Your best friend of the world is you've got no filters with. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4941.08s)]
*  I think comedy is not respected because most people can talk and most people are [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4944.48s)]
*  funny occasionally, so they think I could do it. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4948.76s)]
*  But most people can't hit a fastball. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4950.88s)]
*  Most people can't play tennis like a professional. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4953.5199999999995s)]
*  Most people can't do that. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4955.76s)]
*  So you watch someone do that and you go, I can't even do that. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4956.72s)]
*  But you see someone on stage talking like I could talk. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4959.08s)]
*  What's so hard about that? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4961.88s)]
*  I just have to figure out the right words to say and I can be Jimmy Carr. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4963.400000000001s)]
*  Right. Right. Because everybody can talk. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4966.56s)]
*  I think that's part of the problem. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4968.64s)]
*  That's why it doesn't get appreciated the same way music gets appreciated. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4969.92s)]
*  So like if there's plagiarism in music, like [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4973.240000000001s)]
*  there's so there's so many songs where a lick in the song, just one thing about the [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4978.240000000001s)]
*  song and then the people like Bitter Sweet Symphony, they had to give all their [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4984.2s)]
*  money to the Rolling Stones. Yeah. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4988.0s)]
*  They didn't make any money from that song. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4989.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, the weird one was the was it blurred lines was and it wasn't even that it was [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4991.44s)]
*  the same it was the same feel as a Marvin Gaye song. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=4997.24s)]
*  Same feel seems like a stretch. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5000.48s)]
*  I don't remember that one. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5002.92s)]
*  I thought they did decide that it was like the beats were copied. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5004.32s)]
*  But, you know, I've talked to friends that are musicians and like, listen, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5008.679999999999s)]
*  there's only so many different ways you can put together a beat and rhythms. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5011.32s)]
*  It's like you're going to get similarities all the time. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5016.24s)]
*  And it doesn't necessarily mean that it's plagiarism, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5019.2s)]
*  but plagiarism in comedies like outwardly dismissed, like there's no lawsuits. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5022.4s)]
*  But yet comedians know it's self-pleasing. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5028.36s)]
*  It's self-pleasing. It's like someone does that. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5030.88s)]
*  You go, I mean, now I think that's the first time I ever saw you was calling out. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5032.88s)]
*  Yeah. But before that, a lot of people got away with it, man. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5037.0s)]
*  A lot of people built careers off of plagiarism. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5040.64s)]
*  Well, even the great Robin Williams had that reputation. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5043.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5046.360000000001s)]
*  Because it was it was doing kind of this other thing. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5048.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Well, it's like when you're just freeballing and you get stuck, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5050.56s)]
*  you just take somebody else's stuff. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5054.320000000001s)]
*  And back then, there was no Internet, so there's no accountability. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5055.76s)]
*  I think that's just the big part of this equation is the Internet comes along. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5058.92s)]
*  And there's been so many instances of a [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5063.4400000000005s)]
*  comedian's career now like really fucking crashing because the Internet sleuths, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5066.16s)]
*  they start looking at it and they go, no, no, no, this is this came from that. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5072.12s)]
*  That came from this. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5076.12s)]
*  Like her special here is like his this is his bit. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5077.4800000000005s)]
*  This is her bit. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5080.64s)]
*  These are this is all plagiarized and just reworked horse shit. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5081.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think because hell is the way you can tell is when they have another [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5085.68s)]
*  special after they've been called out and then it's horrible. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5089.400000000001s)]
*  Right. There's just no content. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5092.52s)]
*  Well, it's that thing of like you have to give the world irrefutable proof. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5095.04s)]
*  You are who you say you are. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5098.32s)]
*  You know, if it's one joke, fine. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5099.96s)]
*  If it's ten thousand jokes, you go, OK, this is something. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5101.32s)]
*  I mean, we spoke about this last time, that thing of because I'm working on a [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5104.0s)]
*  thing with my friend, Amanda Baker and Abby Grant. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5106.76s)]
*  They came and they taught at the mothership. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5109.48s)]
*  Yes, because we're trying to work on this book about like teaching comedy in the [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5111.72s)]
*  same way that people teach music, like having a language of it and taking some [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5116.4s)]
*  of the alchemy and the mystery away from that and sort of thinking about, well, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5120.52s)]
*  what really, you know, not to not to say that it's like a something I can do or a [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5126.240000000001s)]
*  machine can do, but the idea of like teaching people the structure of it so [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5132.76s)]
*  it's less kind of, you know, hey, I just comes to me on stage, right? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5137.64s)]
*  Maybe codifying it a little bit more. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5140.6s)]
*  And I mean, I'm working with these two [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5142.400000000001s)]
*  incredible women, Abby Grant and Amanda Baker on the on the book. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5144.280000000001s)]
*  And it's it's taken a long time. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5147.320000000001s)]
*  But I do think it's something that if you could teach in schools, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5149.04s)]
*  the idea of comedy, even as opposed to music, which is wonderful to learn and you [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5153.0s)]
*  appreciate music much more if you've ever given the guitar a go, [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5157.04s)]
*  as you can appreciate what they're doing. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5160.400000000001s)]
*  But the idea of comedy is being taught because you go, well, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5162.4400000000005s)]
*  you have to write down and order your thoughts. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5166.32s)]
*  That's a value. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5168.56s)]
*  You have to learn how to communicate and speak publicly. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5169.72s)]
*  That's a value. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5172.8s)]
*  And then you're speaking in your authentic voice. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5174.04s)]
*  And that's the saddest thing. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5176.2s)]
*  Most people live and die and they never speak in their own authentic voice. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5177.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a it's a great thing to give kids, I think. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5182.0s)]
*  I think it'd be a great thing to, you know, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5185.64s)]
*  if it's an after school activity, I would sign my kids up. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5187.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely value to it. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5190.120000000001s)]
*  And even if you don't have that style of comedy, like a joke writing style, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5192.160000000001s)]
*  even if you're more of a storyteller, you know, like a Ron White type, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5196.120000000001s)]
*  tell stories, there's always value in learning different techniques to craft [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5199.360000000001s)]
*  material and craft jokes. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5204.68s)]
*  But I look at what Ron does. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5206.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, my love language is the one liner. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5208.04s)]
*  I like jokes and it's it's quite old fashioned in a way. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5210.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's like it's a very old fashioned kind of way of and it's less [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5214.04s)]
*  about my life, but you're like a folk singer. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5216.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5219.04s)]
*  And then I'm but then I'm trying to I've got a good fastball. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5219.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5222.96s)]
*  And then I'm trying to work on the the other bits. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5223.200000000001s)]
*  But that's kind of what I love about the industry because it's it's everything. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5225.200000000001s)]
*  It's all I can get good at that. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5229.160000000001s)]
*  And then I can I can do like 20 minutes of fastballs and then do. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5230.8s)]
*  I've started about a year ago. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5234.76s)]
*  I started putting I started working with a videographer and putting stuff out of [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5236.68s)]
*  heckle videos and people talking to me. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5240.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I noticed those. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5242.88s)]
*  And you go. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5244.200000000001s)]
*  It's just such a joyful thing because it's almost like doing the stuff when you go, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5245.08s)]
*  just hit me whatever you want. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5249.240000000001s)]
*  I'll do anything. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5250.84s)]
*  It's like seeing a magician do real magic because you kind of go right. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5251.88s)]
*  Yeah, I've worked this muscle hard enough. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5255.92s)]
*  I can write I'll write jokes live for you now. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5258.240000000001s)]
*  Have you done bottom of the barrel? [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5260.68s)]
*  No. What's bottom of the barrel? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5262.360000000001s)]
*  Bottom of the barrels. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5263.56s)]
*  Brian Simpson show at the mothership where you have a whiskey barrel and you reach [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5264.240000000001s)]
*  your hand into the whiskey barrel to pull out suggestions for topics. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5268.400000000001s)]
*  So the audience, the audience didn't pull. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5272.280000000001s)]
*  Provenza used to have. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5274.64s)]
*  Set list. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5277.04s)]
*  Do you remember there was set list? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5277.8s)]
*  Yeah, but that was not provided by the audience. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5279.120000000001s)]
*  I don't believe. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5281.200000000001s)]
*  No, that was like that. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5281.92s)]
*  And it was a bit hat on a hat. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5283.04s)]
*  Like sometimes it'd be just crazy things. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5284.320000000001s)]
*  But it was a bunch of different versions of that. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5286.56s)]
*  There was another one stand up on the spot. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5290.080000000001s)]
*  There was an L.A. one where you had the audience like raise their hand and come [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5292.72s)]
*  up with it, but the problem with that one is then you encourage people to just yell [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5297.320000000001s)]
*  out. And so while you're in the middle of talking about something, someone else will [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5301.12s)]
*  yell out a different subject because they're just greedy and they just don't want [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5304.88s)]
*  you know what I mean? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5307.96s)]
*  Like you have to have good audience participation in that one. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5308.76s)]
*  But again, that thing of like going, yeah, it's performative being in the audience. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5312.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5315.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I always think that thing with hecklers, like there's a there's more [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5316.08s)]
*  hecklers in the UK. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5319.280000000001s)]
*  Like when you travel around the world, like so I'm touring everywhere, like all [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5320.5199999999995s)]
*  over America, UK, Australia, New Zealand, every territory. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5323.599999999999s)]
*  And you notice different places have different traditions when it comes to [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5327.759999999999s)]
*  heckling. That's the biggest thing you notice when you travel in North America. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5330.839999999999s)]
*  People are very slow to shout out during a show because they think they're am I [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5334.4s)]
*  spoiling the show? Am I ruining this? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5339.12s)]
*  And I actively encourage like I don't mind if it's a little bit aggressive because [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5340.96s)]
*  we're all in service of the evening. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5344.48s)]
*  Right. We're all in service of like I don't mind if you win. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5346.4s)]
*  Well, that's confusing for the audience because some people don't want any [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5349.24s)]
*  heckles. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5352.44s)]
*  Yes. Sometimes it is like some comics just want to they have a set and they want [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5353.28s)]
*  to just perform their set. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5356.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I like it when people join. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5358.28s)]
*  Like no one wants someone to talk over their punchline. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5360.16s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5362.8s)]
*  But you want people to you're going into an agreement with a bunch of drunks and [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5363.48s)]
*  a lot of them are just, you know, they're not that smart in the first place. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5368.08s)]
*  And so they don't even understand when to yell out. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5371.32s)]
*  And so they're yelling out while you're in the middle of something else. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5374.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5377.04s)]
*  And then I'm very lucky. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5377.48s)]
*  I suppose it's that thing with you can, you know, it's self selecting. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5379.639999999999s)]
*  You know, your audience come and they find you and it's. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5384.2s)]
*  Sure. But sometimes crazy people just show up at your audience. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5387.24s)]
*  Oh, my God. If I had to compile, I thought maybe I should compile a video of me [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5391.08s)]
*  kicking people out shows. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5395.08s)]
*  Well, now they know you do that too. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5396.08s)]
*  So they probably look forward to doing it with you. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5398.32s)]
*  And so you get kind of the wrong kind of people that are encouraged to yell shit [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5401.2s)]
*  out. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5405.12s)]
*  No, I get I get pretty good. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5405.92s)]
*  Most of the time. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5407.36s)]
*  Yeah, pretty good, because I always think I don't have a schizophrenics. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5408.2s)]
*  I don't have like a percentage. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5410.5599999999995s)]
*  It's only like one percent. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5411.72s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know if they're buying tickets. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5413.2s)]
*  They should buy two tickets, shouldn't they? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5414.8s)]
*  I don't think they think they're two different people. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5417.44s)]
*  I think one for each personality. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5420.08s)]
*  I think schizophrenia is just like your connection to the world is frayed. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5421.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. Jesus. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5425.28s)]
*  There. But for the grace of God. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5427.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, we don't even understand what that feels like. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5428.68s)]
*  And, you know, there's a guy who was schizophrenic that has the disease [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5430.72s)]
*  progressed. He was an artist. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5433.68s)]
*  And as his disease progressed, you could see his art getting fucking weirder and [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5438.16s)]
*  weirder and more abstract and distorted. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5442.56s)]
*  It's the most terrifying. It's a horrifying. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5446.84s)]
*  It's one of the most. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5448.360000000001s)]
*  You know, there's a bunch of really horrifying ones. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5449.76s)]
*  Lou Gehrig's disease is a bunch of different things that just you just go fuck. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5452.16s)]
*  Again, gratitude. Just be happy that you don't have that. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5457.64s)]
*  And that's another good, solid reason to try to take care of your physical body. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5461.48s)]
*  Yeah. Make that bitch work for you. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5466.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, 100 percent. Don't have it fucking malfunctioning. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5469.08s)]
*  Well, if you can avoid it, I think kind of food is the thing as well. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5472.36s)]
*  Food is the medicine before medicine. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5475.12s)]
*  I just try and it's hard on the road. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5477.5199999999995s)]
*  It is. The best way to do it on the road for me is carnivore. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5480.2s)]
*  I just only eat meat when I'm on the road. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5484.24s)]
*  Well, I do that most of the time anyway. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5486.4s)]
*  But when I'm on the road, it makes everything so much simpler. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5488.36s)]
*  Just mostly just eat meat. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5490.8s)]
*  Are you traveling much of the moment? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5492.96s)]
*  You know, much you're not. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5494.08s)]
*  No, even when I did my last special, my Netflix special, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5495.4800000000005s)]
*  I prepared for it entirely at my own club. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5498.72s)]
*  And then I hadn't done any theaters at all in like a year and a half. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5500.92s)]
*  And I did the first Friday night at the theater. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5504.56s)]
*  Like, oh, it's different because instead of doing like 200 people, I was doing thousands. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5506.6s)]
*  I was like, this is weird. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5511.360000000001s)]
*  Like the timing's different. But I'm like, oh, good. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5512.68s)]
*  I got I find the timing figured out the timing's different in like [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5515.360000000001s)]
*  I often go from theater to arena. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5518.48s)]
*  Arena time is way different. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5521.48s)]
*  Yeah, I tell you what, I got it from Chappelle. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5523.04s)]
*  I was I was out in Australia on tour last time and I had like one night off. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5524.92s)]
*  And Chappelle was in town that night. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5529.28s)]
*  So I said, well, I'll go up with you. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5530.68s)]
*  So I went up and he had it in the round. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5532.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's how I do it, too. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5534.96s)]
*  I had so genius because it's like the the thrill of. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5536.16s)]
*  I don't want to I don't want to say never, but I may never be a professional boxer. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5540.16s)]
*  There I said it. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5545.12s)]
*  But walking into the it's like walking to a ring [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5546.52s)]
*  because you've got like security around you and you have to walk through [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5550.120000000001s)]
*  the audience onto the stage and up the steps. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5552.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's so thrilling. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5554.080000000001s)]
*  And then you put the screens above and even in a 10,000 seater. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5555.320000000001s)]
*  No one's more than, you know, right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5558.96s)]
*  Two thousand seats back kind of thing. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5561.4400000000005s)]
*  So you go so everyone's got a great seat and you're kind of rotating. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5563.080000000001s)]
*  And I just I love it. It's incredible. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5566.0s)]
*  It's also intimate in a weird way because the people are seeing [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5569.040000000001s)]
*  the other people on the other side of them, which never happens. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5572.120000000001s)]
*  And they're seeing people laughing. Yeah. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5574.64s)]
*  I hadn't thought of that, but they're seeing people laughing. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5576.599999999999s)]
*  And it's that thing of going, OK, well, we're all it's like an event [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5578.599999999999s)]
*  where we're having fun together. It's great. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5581.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the best way. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5583.839999999999s)]
*  It is, although the timing that changes when you go, OK, it's a theater. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5584.599999999999s)]
*  And it's like even a thousand seats. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5588.879999999999s)]
*  I know it's in the UK sometimes like you've got to let the palladium [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5591.04s)]
*  is my favorite place to play. Right. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5594.28s)]
*  And the palladium is a theater that was built 120 years ago. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5596.08s)]
*  So the fire regulations 120 years ago were. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5599.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I hope no one dies. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5603.24s)]
*  That's there was the fire eggs. Good luck. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5605.64s)]
*  There's doors. If there's a fire, I guess, leave. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5607.160000000001s)]
*  So it's tight. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5610.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like it's 2200 people, but it's they're close to you. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5611.8s)]
*  And then sometimes you go to a place that was built two years ago [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5615.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's beautiful and air conditioned. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5617.6s)]
*  But the people are so far away because the seats and the aisles [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5619.68s)]
*  and everything's been built for safety. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5623.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. So it's like you'd never get it. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5625.280000000001s)]
*  You couldn't build one of those now. Yeah. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5627.320000000001s)]
*  It's kind of it was it was it was better when it was they're all on top of you. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5629.84s)]
*  Yeah. But then people died in fires. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5633.160000000001s)]
*  You know, well, you've always got to look at the negatives. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5634.92s)]
*  They should have a way to like open the wall in case of a fire. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5638.36s)]
*  It should be a hinge. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5641.4s)]
*  We just just push the whole wall down. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5642.6s)]
*  Everybody could just run out real quick. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5644.2s)]
*  That's not a bad idea that in there, like, you know, they do with a battleship [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5646.28s)]
*  and they let the tanks out the back of them. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5649.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, yeah. How about that? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5651.16s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5653.6s)]
*  Yeah. Like a big old aircraft carrier. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5654.8s)]
*  Like drop it. Hmm. Yeah. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5657.0s)]
*  Or fucking fire extinguishers everywhere, like in the wall. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5660.68s)]
*  Everywhere spray water on people. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5665.12s)]
*  Yeah. Just under under every seat. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5667.72s)]
*  All over the ceiling. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5670.12s)]
*  I mean, they do have that in some places where it's dangerous. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5671.64s)]
*  You know, they have fire sprinklers that are built into the wall. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5675.12s)]
*  I feel like we're getting close to the we're getting close to the old bit of the, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5679.72s)]
*  you know, the black box thing they have on airplanes where it crashes. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5683.12s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5687.0s)]
*  Everyone had the observation of just build the plane out of that. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5688.04s)]
*  Right. What's that made of? Right. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5690.76s)]
*  But how about parachutes for planes? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5693.16s)]
*  How about one of those? Is that hard to do? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5695.799999999999s)]
*  Parachutes for planes? Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5698.879999999999s)]
*  This is what happens. And what happens? A big idea. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5700.48s)]
*  How much would it cost? [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5702.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, which would it cost to have a big fucking parachute at the top of the plane [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5704.719999999999s)]
*  where shit goes totally sideways, pull it, float down to the ground? [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5708.2s)]
*  Is that possible? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5713.0s)]
*  Is that an incredibly dumb idea or is that genius? It's both. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5714.04s)]
*  It's both. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5717.16s)]
*  I'm sure somebody else's thought of it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5719.12s)]
*  You know? Yeah, that seems. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5722.24s)]
*  I mean, don't they have something like that on Air Force One? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5725.28s)]
*  Where like if if the plane's going down, the president get the little compartment [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5727.76s)]
*  and ejects, is that real or is that like some movie shit? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5731.84s)]
*  That might be some movie shit. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5735.5199999999995s)]
*  See if that's real. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5737.4s)]
*  I think there might be like some shit, but that that sounds like a good idea. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5738.8s)]
*  Like what if Air Force One goes down like this was the online [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5743.0s)]
*  chatter about the president getting a plane from Qatar? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5747.4s)]
*  We've got a gift of a plane. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5753.44s)]
*  Yeah, supposedly. Yeah. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5754.599999999999s)]
*  Like Air Force One does not have an escape pod in the real world. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5755.8s)]
*  OK, can we can movie air? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5761.08s)]
*  Can we confirm is this the real world? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5763.12s)]
*  I guess maybe this is we think it is as far as how we're acting. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5766.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is the real world. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5771.12s)]
*  What do you what do you think about simulation theory? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5772.2s)]
*  I think it's more likely every day. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5774.92s)]
*  The more time goes on, the more I think it's likely. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5777.84s)]
*  I really like it. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5781.4800000000005s)]
*  I would say so. Yeah. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5782.400000000001s)]
*  With the plane with a parachute. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5783.76s)]
*  I think some did you just manifest this? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5786.280000000001s)]
*  How did this parachute planes? [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5789.400000000001s)]
*  You Googled it. It's pretty dope. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5791.320000000001s)]
*  So is this guy use this? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5792.96s)]
*  I don't that that that doesn't seem like it's happened, but they're [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5794.080000000001s)]
*  maybe testing seems like a dangerous test, too, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5798.68s)]
*  because you have to wreck a plane if it doesn't work. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5801.76s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. Yeah. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5803.36s)]
*  All right. How would you test one of those? [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5805.16s)]
*  You'd have to have a bunch of planes. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5807.12s)]
*  Oh, look, they did test it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5808.44s)]
*  Is that real or is that a that's real? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5810.04s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, it seems real. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5812.2s)]
*  Oh, so you've seen a real big one. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5814.2s)]
*  A big one for a jumbo jet. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5816.88s)]
*  It's still going to be a bump. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5818.28s)]
*  It's going to be a bump when you land. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5819.5199999999995s)]
*  It's not I mean, better that than a ball of flame. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5820.96s)]
*  The fuck are you not going to land and then have a ball of. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5824.16s)]
*  Well, you might. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5826.599999999999s)]
*  Hey, listen, let's give it a go. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5827.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Give it a go. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5828.759999999999s)]
*  Maybe you could jettison all the fuel on the way down [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5829.679999999999s)]
*  so you could soak people's homes with jet fuel. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5832.88s)]
*  And it just bounces. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5837.200000000001s)]
*  There's no fuel in it to start a giant, enormous fire. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5838.4800000000005s)]
*  There's a reason this one there's a reason we're not in charge of this. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5841.280000000001s)]
*  Coming down with the help. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5844.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, look at that. It worked. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5845.68s)]
*  All right. It worked. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5847.6s)]
*  Yeah, but that's it's taking. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5848.72s)]
*  It's taken like that's taken for. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5849.8s)]
*  I do not like the nose down approach. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5851.96s)]
*  That's taken like four parking spaces. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5854.84s)]
*  You just see two puddles on the windshield from the pilots. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5857.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Right. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5860.64s)]
*  OK, simulation theory. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5861.64s)]
*  I if I like think I like thinking about it because I kind of go, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5863.76s)]
*  I've got such a crazy life. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5866.68s)]
*  Right. Like, I'm so how could it be real? [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5868.8s)]
*  I'm sitting here with you. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5870.92s)]
*  Yeah. I was Chappelle on Sunday. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5871.96s)]
*  I was Woody Halston came to the show last night. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5874.12s)]
*  Yeah. I know him a little bit from then. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5876.68s)]
*  He's going this feels like a cartoon. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5878.160000000001s)]
*  It doesn't feel real somehow. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5880.4800000000005s)]
*  And yet you go, well, it's an interesting way to think about the world [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5883.96s)]
*  because you go, well, if is if this is a game, what's the scorecard? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5886.320000000001s)]
*  How do you win? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5891.12s)]
*  And it kind of makes you think about, well, what's important in your life? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5892.5199999999995s)]
*  What's the, you know, measurable and immeasurable metrics? Right. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5894.5599999999995s)]
*  I often think about there's like there's CV resume points [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5898.92s)]
*  and then there's eulogy points. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5905.04s)]
*  And often those things kind of conflict, you know, like the things that we [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5907.84s)]
*  you know, career wise, you have a great career. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5911.639999999999s)]
*  But if you don't have kids in a family. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5914.08s)]
*  Who's at the who's doing the eulogy? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5916.76s)]
*  Who's who's speaking for you? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5918.84s)]
*  What are the things that really matter? [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5920.52s)]
*  People that are great people that don't have kids in a family, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5922.4800000000005s)]
*  but they have a lot of good friends. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5925.04s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, that's the people going to miss them. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5926.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5929.12s)]
*  I don't think it's a total requirement to be a, you know, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5929.68s)]
*  actualized human being to have children. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5934.4800000000005s)]
*  But I think it's definitely benefited me. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5936.96s)]
*  But I still hate it when people would say, like, you know, until you have kids, [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5939.72s)]
*  you don't know what the world is all about. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5944.16s)]
*  Like, OK, for you, like, how do I know what you've gone through? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5945.56s)]
*  How do I know your perspective? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5948.56s)]
*  Yeah, I had kids. Yeah. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5949.96s)]
*  But there's a lot of people out there with children that are fools. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5951.6s)]
*  It's like it's a nonsense way of living, of thinking that you have to have kids. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5954.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think there's wonderful people that I know that are never going to have kids. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5958.4800000000005s)]
*  But that thing of it's fine. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  You can still have eulogy things. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5962.88s)]
*  Yeah. Things that aren't necessarily. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5965.68s)]
*  It's not scorecard. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5968.240000000001s)]
*  It's not like he made a hundred million dollars. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5969.080000000001s)]
*  He wins when he's dead. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5971.72s)]
*  Like, it doesn't matter. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5973.0s)]
*  No one cares. Like, what did you do? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5974.04s)]
*  Like, how did you how did you treat people? [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5975.92s)]
*  How did you live your life? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5977.76s)]
*  What kind of an impact did you have on your fellow man? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5979.16s)]
*  Like when you interacted with people, do they have a memorable [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5981.280000000001s)]
*  experience with you, like your friends and people you worked with? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5985.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, oh, do you know Jimmy used to always say, you know, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5989.56s)]
*  and you sit around talking about them? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5992.2s)]
*  I suppose it's that thing of like legacy now [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5994.0s)]
*  almost kind of is a secular religion for like what you leave behind. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=5997.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like you sort of think of the [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6002.16s)]
*  the afterlife. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6005.04s)]
*  You know, I don't really believe in an afterlife, but it's the the kids. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6006.4s)]
*  So when you be stunned, if it was real, though, like, I mean, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6010.24s)]
*  I don't believe in an afterlife, but I would be so fascinated. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6013.92s)]
*  To to be to have. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6020.2s)]
*  Undeniable evidence like to pass through, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6022.56s)]
*  like imagine if you were one of those people that had a heart attack [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6026.72s)]
*  and died and had one of those really crazy near death experiences. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6029.44s)]
*  I think back, I think there's that near clear. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6033.5199999999995s)]
*  The near death experience is available to everyone in the form of DMT. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6036.28s)]
*  Because everyone has the same experience of this. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6040.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. Another realm, another world beyond. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6043.24s)]
*  Maybe that's the afterlife, Jimmy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6046.12s)]
*  If it is, maybe that's it. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6048.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, that might be it. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6049.4s)]
*  That might be it. It seems familiar. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6051.24s)]
*  That's the weirdest part about it. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6053.88s)]
*  It seems familiar. It seems more real than here. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6055.44s)]
*  So it makes you wonder, like, what is this that we're doing? [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6059.28s)]
*  I have a feeling that what I said before is correct [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6062.44s)]
*  about the electronic caterpillar becoming the butterfly. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6066.6s)]
*  I think that's our I think there's a bunch of different factors [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6070.72s)]
*  that are leading us to expand technologically. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6074.56s)]
*  I think it's the primary thing that we do as a species. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6078.32s)]
*  I think we're probably that's what we're designed for. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6081.84s)]
*  Just like bees make beehives and ants make ant hills. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6084.44s)]
*  I think the curiosity of the human animal is always going to lead them [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6088.72s)]
*  to an artificial intelligence that's far superior than its own. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6092.88s)]
*  Just eventually, ultimately, just takes a long ass time. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6096.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, I mean, you say a long time, but I mean, really, when did this? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6099.360000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of years ago, it started with stone tools. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6103.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's really what it is. It's all technology, right? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6107.320000000001s)]
*  Stone tools allowed us to kill things without using our teeth. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6109.68s)]
*  And then we eventually figured out shelter. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6113.240000000001s)]
*  And then we figured out a way to maximize cooking things, cooking things. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6115.68s)]
*  And then the amount, you know, our brains, you know, you're able to feed that. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6119.6s)]
*  So food's a huge part. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6123.0s)]
*  Like what we're doing now, language and comedy. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6124.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's no I don't think it's like it's like there's [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6129.12s)]
*  different strains of kind of Darwinian evolution. Right. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6132.56s)]
*  So there's there's the survival. Right. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6135.6s)]
*  And then there's reproductive. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6138.320000000001s)]
*  And I think what we're doing now, speaking, I think is reproductive. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6140.400000000001s)]
*  I think what we're doing is it's almost like peacock feathers. Right. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6145.16s)]
*  So you go feathers initially weren't for flight. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6148.72s)]
*  They were for display. Really? [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6152.32s)]
*  Well, that's the that's the the theory is that well, how did feathers? [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6154.4s)]
*  Because what was the point of a feather before it was for wings for flying? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6157.84s)]
*  How would you get to that through evolution? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6163.08s)]
*  Well, actually, if it was for display first, if the peacock [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6165.12s)]
*  is using the feathers correctly, that was the original idea for display, for mating. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6167.68s)]
*  And to show that I have this I have so much extra energy. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6172.76s)]
*  I'll be a good mate. Right. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6177.12s)]
*  To show the female so much color and vibrancy and stuff. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6178.84s)]
*  So why Bird Singh? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6182.72s)]
*  I've got this excess energy. I'll be a good mate. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6183.96s)]
*  OK, so that that thing. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6186.88s)]
*  I think the weird thing is it came from dinosaurs, though. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6188.0s)]
*  Dinosaurs, they believe, are feathered now. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6190.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6192.72s)]
*  Which is so like that's what dinosaurs were breeding. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6193.6s)]
*  Imagine. Yeah. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6196.16s)]
*  Well, dinosaurs as well. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6197.12s)]
*  The theory on why they died out is interesting on the [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6198.360000000001s)]
*  they they used to. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6202.56s)]
*  So we randomly assign gender. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6203.64s)]
*  And they assign gender as on the basis of temperature. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6206.24s)]
*  So when the asteroid hit, it didn't kill all the dust, didn't kill all the dinosaurs. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6211.360000000001s)]
*  What happened was every dinosaur was born female [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6216.360000000001s)]
*  in the next generation because the temperature cooled. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6220.2s)]
*  Some lizards still do it. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6222.96s)]
*  They assign gender by what the temperature is. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6224.56s)]
*  So the temperature falls, you go, right. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6226.88s)]
*  OK, everyone's female. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6228.76s)]
*  And when the temperature is above a certain amount, everyone's male. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6229.92s)]
*  So there's a generation of all female or male, whatever it was. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6232.72s)]
*  Dinosaurs. What a flaw. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6235.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. But you but you would. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6237.64s)]
*  But because you're the temperature, we always assume is like is static [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6239.28s)]
*  and we don't see the geological changes over time in temperature. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6243.92s)]
*  So I feel like the Yucatan meteor was like the inoculation from the universe. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6247.84s)]
*  They'd realize this dinosaur thing is a fucking problem. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6252.8s)]
*  Like no mammals are ever going to figure out how to make [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6255.88s)]
*  AI when you've got a five thousand pound super lizard [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6259.76s)]
*  running around with a face the size of a VW bus with giant teeth on. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6264.52s)]
*  And we kind of fucking wipe these things out. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6269.400000000001s)]
*  Is there another world where there's dinosaurs with AI? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6271.240000000001s)]
*  Because if they're coming, we're fucked. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6274.4400000000005s)]
*  No, no. The dinosaurs never get to AI. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6275.96s)]
*  You have to be super vulnerable to get to AI. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6278.68s)]
*  Like you don't have a bunch of jack guys working at open AI. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6282.2s)]
*  You notice that? Yeah. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6285.56s)]
*  You have to be super vulnerable to get to AI. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6286.76s)]
*  Well, it's a weird thing. You said earlier about the idea of like our [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6289.6s)]
*  our competitive advantage, right? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6293.16s)]
*  You drop one guy in the jungle. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6294.84s)]
*  You fed the animals, drop 10 guys and you have an apex predator. Right. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6296.360000000001s)]
*  Cooperation is our superpower. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6300.76s)]
*  And for me, cooperation is downstream of play. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6303.56s)]
*  Play is everything. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6308.88s)]
*  We're the playing animal. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6310.08s)]
*  Someone wrote a book about this late in the 1930s about how we are designed [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6311.24s)]
*  to play. Our culture is about play and kids play. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6316.08s)]
*  And you go, well, that cooperation is what leads to all of this. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6319.8s)]
*  And weirdly, the Catholic Church, I didn't say this earlier, [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6324.16s)]
*  but the Catholic Church has got a lot to be we got a lot to be grateful for. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6326.32s)]
*  Because in the 12th century, the Catholic Church banned cousin marriage. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6330.16s)]
*  Really? And the reason they did it was because they realized the tribe [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6335.5599999999995s)]
*  was more important than the church. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6340.08s)]
*  And they hated that. Right. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6342.320000000001s)]
*  So the unintended consequence was they said, you can't marry your cousin [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6344.08s)]
*  or your second cousin or your third cousin down to the sixth cousin. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6347.4400000000005s)]
*  Really? And they broke the tribes. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6351.56s)]
*  Now, when you break tribes, what happens? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6354.0s)]
*  Well, you form small family groups and then you have to trust people. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6357.6s)]
*  So trust builds. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6362.92s)]
*  And then from trust, you get guilds and associations [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6364.88s)]
*  and a legal system and everyone. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6369.04s)]
*  Because before that, it's like, well, your cousin, you trust him. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6371.280000000001s)]
*  That's what's family. The royal family. Right. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6374.96s)]
*  Back in the day, doomed the royal family. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6377.72s)]
*  You know, you know, we still got them. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6380.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, the old ones with the fucked up faces. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6381.84s)]
*  Yeah. With a no chin. Yeah. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6384.52s)]
*  They look weird. Yeah. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6386.160000000001s)]
*  No chin. Just into marriage, into marriage, into marriage. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6387.360000000001s)]
*  So that's what was taken away. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6389.84s)]
*  So the unintended consequence of that was more cooperation. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6391.120000000001s)]

*  Barry Linden with Harvey Keitel, amazing movie. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6763.24s)]
*  I never saw it. It's lit by candle. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6765.64s)]
*  There's no lights in that movie. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6768.16s)]
*  He shot it by candlelight. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6770.08s)]
*  And the reason he was able to make it was because he had the best lenses ever [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6771.08s)]
*  made by humans, which were the NASA lenses that they took to the moon landing. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6775.5199999999995s)]
*  So that was Hasselbad. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6780.2s)]
*  So Hasselbad. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6782.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the company that made those cameras. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6783.84s)]
*  OK, but who made the lens? [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6787.96s)]
*  It says I super speed. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6789.64s)]
*  OK, does that make sense? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6791.04s)]
*  OK, so he had these lenses. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6792.12s)]
*  So Kubrick shot everything with these lenses. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6793.64s)]
*  Now, here's the question for you. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6795.4s)]
*  How did Stanley Kubrick get those lenses? [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6797.2s)]
*  Maybe at the NASA garage sale they had in 1971, [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6799.76s)]
*  where they sold all the stuff on the front lawn. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6802.76s)]
*  OK, so the story I got told, which I want to ask you about is [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6805.8s)]
*  they obviously is the middle of the Cold War, right? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6811.120000000001s)]
*  And the moon landing was a flex by the Americans. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6815.68s)]
*  It was a big deal. Right. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6819.080000000001s)]
*  So they rehearsed the shit out of that. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6820.200000000001s)]
*  Who did they rehearse it with? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6823.080000000001s)]
*  Well, the best director in the world. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6824.280000000001s)]
*  So they brought in a young Stanley Kubrick [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6826.8s)]
*  and he filmed the rehearsals. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6829.68s)]
*  So they had to rehearse everything before they went up there. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6832.96s)]
*  So I'm not saying the moon landings didn't happen. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6835.280000000001s)]
*  I think they definitely did happen. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6836.76s)]
*  So who's saying that Stanley Kubrick filmed the rehearsals? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6837.76s)]
*  I can't remember who told me this. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6842.04s)]
*  That sounds like horseshoe. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6843.56s)]
*  But how did he have the time? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6845.320000000001s)]
*  Sorry, how did he get the lenses from NASA? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6847.64s)]
*  How did he get the lenses? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6849.52s)]
*  He definitely had the NASA lenses. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6850.320000000001s)]
*  We bought them from NASA. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6852.2s)]
*  Well, you know, he was a he got paid genius mathematician. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6853.24s)]
*  You know, I didn't know that. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6856.56s)]
*  Yeah, he he used to do complex equations in his spare time. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6857.76s)]
*  Yeah, he was a genius, like a legitimate genius. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6862.96s)]
*  So he probably had a deep connection to the scientific community [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6865.76s)]
*  and he probably maintained that all throughout doing 2001. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6868.64s)]
*  So, you know, Kubrick was so the way he would do films [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6873.080000000001s)]
*  was there were so many layers to his films, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6878.280000000001s)]
*  like there's so many layers to The Shining. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6880.72s)]
*  You know, he said this brilliant thing about movies. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6883.280000000001s)]
*  He said, don't you know, if you want to if you want to tell a story, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6886.6s)]
*  make people feel something they don't have a name for. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6890.88s)]
*  So there's so many bits in The Shining that don't make sense. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6894.84s)]
*  Right. Like the geometry of the room doesn't make sense. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6898.160000000001s)]
*  Or but and it kind of forces you to really see something. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6901.04s)]
*  Yeah. Like so much of our life, right, is we're not really seeing things. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6905.04s)]
*  I think it's the gift of being a standup comedian. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6910.04s)]
*  We get to see things. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6912.0s)]
*  Mostly guys of our age are just remembering things. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6913.56s)]
*  Right. They don't have a lot of other experiences. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6917.88s)]
*  Or they're having a very repetitive, you know, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6919.92s)]
*  if you commute every day to the same office, you don't remember 365 days. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6921.8s)]
*  You're just kind of one memory and then you're just on repeat. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6926.96s)]
*  Whereas if you have unique experiences, it's not that we don't have enough time. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6930.080000000001s)]
*  We just waste a lot of it. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6933.92s)]
*  And we don't we want unique novel experience. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6935.4400000000005s)]
*  And so part of the reason I travel the world is to have unique novel experience [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6938.6s)]
*  and to see things in a different way. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6942.04s)]
*  And sometimes when you you know, you watch like a Kubrick or a Tarantino movie, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6943.32s)]
*  he's just seeing something in such a pure way. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6946.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's incredible. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6949.84s)]
*  Yeah. It's a unique artistic vision that makes you sort of [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6951.88s)]
*  it just takes you out of mundane existence and go, wow, this guy. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6956.400000000001s)]
*  Like 2001 is such a weird movie, man. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6961.68s)]
*  I saw it again last year. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6963.96s)]
*  I hadn't seen it in a long time. And I watched it again. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6965.08s)]
*  I was like, God, imagine making this film and like, what was it? [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6967.12s)]
*  Like 60. What year was it? [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6970.96s)]
*  60, 70. Was it 70? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6973.88s)]
*  70, 70, 70s. No, 70, 70. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6976.24s)]
*  68. What? Yeah. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6979.64s)]
*  So it's before the moon landing. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6981.68s)]
*  And it's all going on at the same time, which 68. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6983.6s)]
*  It's incredible. Yeah. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6989.08s)]
*  Because it's kind of futuristic now. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6991.96s)]
*  Yeah. There's that weird thing of like you ever read? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6993.72s)]
*  It's weird that the monkeys when they find the monolith. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6997.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it's like I have very bizarre theories [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=6999.639999999999s)]
*  about the evolution of the human animal itself. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7003.4s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7006.4s)]
*  I don't I don't necessarily think it happened without help. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7007.04s)]
*  I have a feeling that we were assisted. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7010.96s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons why we vary so much. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7014.28s)]
*  We were just like dogs, you know, dogs are so we've dogs vary so much. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7017.639999999999s)]
*  But dogs came from wolves. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7023.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Every dog came from a wolf. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7025.679999999999s)]
*  It does strike me as like it's a very strange thing [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7027.68s)]
*  how long humanity has been here and how recently [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7029.92s)]
*  program like 10,000 years ago in northern Japan was the first settlement [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7034.400000000001s)]
*  and how quickly things have progressed. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7040.240000000001s)]
*  True. I don't think I don't think we're right about that. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7042.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think no, there's an interesting there's a bunch of interesting guys, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7045.200000000001s)]
*  but there's one that I who's that guy that I brought up the other day? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7048.8s)]
*  Who's a British anthropologist? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7051.240000000001s)]
*  Well, I already like who has this. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7053.92s)]
*  No, you did. That's why I brought that up. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7055.6s)]
*  He's got a YouTube channel and he's like human beings have been in this. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7057.2s)]
*  His argument essentially is that human beings have been in this particular form, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7061.04s)]
*  this homo sapien form for somewhere in their neighborhood of 300,000 years. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7065.2s)]
*  Why would we assume that it took us so long to get to where we are [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7070.5199999999995s)]
*  as far as society and technology and innovation? [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7075.8s)]
*  Isn't it far more likely that this was achieved [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7079.2s)]
*  multiple times, followed by great catastrophes that brought us back to square one? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7082.96s)]
*  And there's a lot of evidence for that. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7088.24s)]
*  There's a lot of evidence for that in terms of like 11,800 years ago, [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7089.72s)]
*  the younger dry ice impact theory. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7094.32s)]
*  But then which is actually physical evidence of like meteor [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7096.24s)]
*  comet impacts on Earth, the gigantic landscape changes, [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7099.76s)]
*  ending of the ice age, melting of the polar ice caps, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7104.4s)]
*  massive flooding, rising sea levels, all that stuff's documented. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7109.0s)]
*  But then he's talking about like, what about 100,000 years before that? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7112.28s)]
*  If we're in the same form, if society did reach a very high level of sophistication, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7116.28s)]
*  maybe in a different way, 100,000 years ago, how much evidence would be left? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7122.0s)]
*  The answer is zero. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7126.16s)]
*  But the human remains the same. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7127.76s)]
*  If you took 100,000 year old person, you could bring him to the fucking [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7129.72s)]
*  shave their face, sit him in a movie theater. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7133.36s)]
*  They would have no you would have no idea that that was a person [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7135.64s)]
*  from 100,000 years ago. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7139.4s)]
*  They look real fucking similar to us. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7140.72s)]
*  Well, I suppose that actually fed them well, so probably didn't get much food back then. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7143.52s)]
*  Yeah, that thing of like the the gratitude, like the idea that you go, [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7148.0s)]
*  how have we only got to this now? [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7151.8s)]
*  Like the idea that you go, well, actually, the taking care of the that Maslow's [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7154.16s)]
*  hierarchy of need, you know, the you know, so you need food, you need shelter, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7158.96s)]
*  you need like we haven't even I mean, we haven't even covered that for most of humanity. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7164.2s)]
*  But certainly in the place that we live, that's all sort of take it. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7168.12s)]
*  We factor all that in. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7171.6s)]
*  That's all like, OK, you've got all of that sorted. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7172.64s)]
*  And then we get to self actualize and we get to specialize. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7175.16s)]
*  And so maybe is that thing of like, I don't know, this the breaking of the tribes [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7180.28s)]
*  and the idea of specialization. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7184.24s)]
*  It's that it's the Dunbar number is the important thing, isn't it? [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7186.28s)]
*  Like, is the great apes. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7189.4s)]
*  So Robert Dunbar is the guy that had that idea of it often comes up [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7190.96s)]
*  when people talk about social media. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7194.0s)]
*  How many friends can you have? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7195.36s)]
*  Like with great apes, they get to a pod of about 60. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7197.28s)]
*  And then they go, I mean, know that guy. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7201.5199999999995s)]
*  He hasn't really groomed me in a long time. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7204.12s)]
*  So I did this documentary once for the BBC with Robert Dunbar. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7207.48s)]
*  And it was, oh, you met actual Robert Dunbar. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7210.28s)]
*  He was incredible. Incredible. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7212.84s)]
*  Was it? I guess 60s. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7214.0s)]
*  He's not that that old. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7217.08s)]
*  But so his theory was kind of, well, actually, what happened [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7218.2s)]
*  that allowed human beings to [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7222.8s)]
*  specialize was remote grooming. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7226.4400000000005s)]
*  So the idea that we could be in a large group and our language allowed us [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7230.24s)]
*  to have a larger group, like 150 friends in the group, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7234.320000000001s)]
*  because we didn't have to pick things out of each other's hair or literally [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7238.96s)]
*  groom each other. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7241.6s)]
*  Hey, Bob, how's it? Look at the lawn looking good. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7242.68s)]
*  Yeah. But that was the great. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7245.68s)]
*  Yeah, that was the great innovation because it allowed us to go, OK, look, [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7247.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm going to go and build this thing. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7249.88s)]
*  You go and do that thing. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7251.64s)]
*  We'll come together and obviously, [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7253.200000000001s)]
*  you know, language predates speech by [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7257.0s)]
*  a million years, millions of years. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7262.56s)]
*  Laughter predates speech by about a million years. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7264.160000000001s)]
*  They think interesting because the animals laugh, chimps laugh. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7270.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, I've got I've got a weird laugh. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7273.400000000001s)]
*  I laugh on an in, huh? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7275.160000000001s)]
*  I like, huh? You have to. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7276.96s)]
*  Yeah. If I if something really strikes me as funny, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7278.6s)]
*  it's like it's such a people often ask, is it real? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7281.24s)]
*  It's the most like crazy laugh. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7284.24s)]
*  Huh? Odd. I laugh on an in-breath, not an out-breath. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7286.44s)]
*  Like Tucker Carlson. He's got that kind of laugh. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7289.64s)]
*  Well, OK. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7292.88s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I don't know where I stand on that. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7294.76s)]
*  Now I'm in trouble. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7297.72s)]
*  Don't get me canceled. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7299.8s)]
*  Well, no, that's an out. That's an out. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7301.96s)]
*  It's just a hyper pitched out. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7303.28s)]
*  But that thing of laughter being a remote tickle is kind of. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7305.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting idea. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7310.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously, it's interesting that it's contagious genuinely. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7311.48s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you're laughing, I'm like, I'll start laughing. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7314.76s)]
*  What the fuck are you laughing at, Jimmy? [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7317.24s)]
*  I'll start laughing if you're laughing hysterically. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7319.2s)]
*  See those German guys that do the laughter therapy? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7321.16s)]
*  No, they do a laughter therapy in Germany. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7323.96s)]
*  And they just it's literally a guy going, we're all going to laugh now. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7327.04s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7330.84s)]
*  And they just force themselves to like there's no nothing funny going on. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7332.28s)]
*  They just force themselves to laugh. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7335.64s)]
*  It is sounds like hell. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7336.84s)]
*  But it's very good for people because once they get going. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7338.28s)]
*  You're out to end up in Germany. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7340.5199999999995s)]
*  Have they ever figured it out? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7341.96s)]
*  Who's the best in Germany? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7344.04s)]
*  I play a lot in Germany. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7345.8s)]
*  Yeah, but you're an English guy going to Germany. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7347.24s)]
*  That's different. I could play in Germany, too. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7349.4s)]
*  But my point is, who's the best guy to come out of Germany? [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7351.44s)]
*  There is a guy who's like playing. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7353.88s)]
*  He played like a stadium there. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7355.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, God, I forget his name. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7357.04s)]
*  But he came to the Edinburgh Festival. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7358.0s)]
*  We are. We had a guy that was the number one comic in Germany [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7359.36s)]
*  who came to the comedy store back in like the early 2000s. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7363.44s)]
*  Super nice guy. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7367.4s)]
*  Barely spoke English and did like real physical comedy. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7368.639999999999s)]
*  Like his whole thing was physical and he just couldn't figure out [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7371.96s)]
*  how to make it work in America. Right. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7374.2s)]
*  It was it was interesting talking to him. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7375.88s)]
*  So I was like, how big are you in Germany, rather? [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7378.08s)]
*  And he's like, oh, in Germany, I'm the number one comedian. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7381.08s)]
*  And, you know, I do really well. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7383.2s)]
*  And I was like, really? [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7384.44s)]
*  So like, what do you do? [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7385.88s)]
*  And it's like I do this kind of like they enjoy like that kind of like [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7387.04s)]
*  slapstick, fall down sort of stuff. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7390.0s)]
*  He did a lot of physical stuff. It was funny. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7393.16s)]
*  But it was like the audience at the comedy store had been used [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7395.48s)]
*  to all these like bang, bang, bang, like set up punchline, set up punchline. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7397.839999999999s)]
*  Joey Diaz. And now here's some guy from Germany. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7401.16s)]
*  Yeah. And he was just it didn't work for him. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7404.36s)]
*  And there's a great old line of like, where would we be without a sense of humor? [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7406.44s)]
*  Germany. Yeah. But they make great cars. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7410.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're funny. Well, that thing of like there's [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7414.599999999999s)]
*  there's scenes coming up everywhere around the world now. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7416.5599999999995s)]

*  I think I think it's kind of the YouTube and the Netflix effect of like, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7433.679999999999s)]

*  He loved to have him on. I'm a huge fan. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7513.76s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's got to come on here because he's like, I don't know. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7515.6s)]
*  I think you'd have a lot in common. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7518.6s)]
*  He's like super. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7519.56s)]
*  I love Hammond. I love James May. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7521.320000000001s)]
*  I love those guys. They were the originals. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7522.96s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm a huge fan of Chris Harris, too. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7524.92s)]
*  And he took over the new top gear. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7527.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they're just passionate about it. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7529.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. There is something of like I'd love someone to do. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7531.16s)]
*  I'm sure I'm sure it exists somewhere and I just haven't been to it. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7534.0s)]
*  But like a museum of the motorcar. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7536.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, there is in Los Angeles. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7538.400000000001s)]
*  If you. Oh, yeah. I know. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7539.76s)]
*  I saw what they were building that and it wasn't finished yet. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7541.16s)]
*  Last time. No, no, no. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7542.88s)]
*  L.A. has had a museum forever. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7544.04s)]
*  Isn't there a new one in? Perhaps. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7546.08s)]
*  Maybe there's a new one. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7548.04s)]
*  Maybe they're making the new one. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7549.0s)]
*  Maybe it's the same company. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7550.52s)]
*  But the L.A. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7551.4400000000005s)]
*  Auto Museum has been around forever because it feels to me like [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7552.2s)]
*  vintage cars are the way to go. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7555.4800000000005s)]
*  There's so many regulations now and there's so much you have to do [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7558.36s)]
*  in your country. Yeah. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7560.88s)]
*  Your goofy country. They lock you down. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7562.64s)]
*  Well, I think that's all going to change that, isn't it? [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7564.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's like we could never get American cars in the UK. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7565.88s)]
*  Yeah. You could never buy a Cadillac in the UK. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7570.12s)]
*  You could never. And maybe that's going to change now. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7572.52s)]
*  I hope so. I'd love to be able to. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7574.240000000001s)]
*  I know some American muscle cars are really popular over there [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7576.240000000001s)]
*  because those are just they're fun. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7578.92s)]
*  They're just fun to drive. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7582.160000000001s)]
*  There's something about American muscle cars, like even the modern ones. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7583.6s)]
*  Like if you buy a modern Ford Mustang, they are fun to drive. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7587.56s)]
*  And there's the rumble of the engine shifting the gears, the manual transmission. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7591.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like I think like the Mustang GT is like the greatest bargain [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7596.64s)]
*  as far as like fun for a dollar in the automobile world today. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7601.52s)]
*  Because I think you get a Mustang GT for like under fifty thousand dollars [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7606.080000000001s)]
*  US like loaded and they're incredible. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7609.6s)]
*  It is an interesting thing of like cars. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7612.240000000001s)]
*  There's a certain point now where what's the last car you could drive [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7614.6s)]
*  as opposed to it driving you right now? [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7620.0s)]
*  So there's an argument to say I had like a Porsche from [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7622.84s)]
*  a Targa from 89. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7628.719999999999s)]
*  So I had the the the G 50. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7632.08s)]
*  But it was air cooled. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7636.2s)]
*  But it was like it was like the it's kind of the last one, I think, before [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7637.16s)]
*  the technology kind of took over and they were just well, not necessarily. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7641.599999999999s)]
*  You know, the nine six fours are still very analog. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7645.08s)]
*  And so are the nine nine threes in especially in comparison to the nine [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7647.719999999999s)]
*  nine six is the nine nine sevens that came after it. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7652.599999999999s)]
*  But the point of those cars is engagement versus proficiency. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7655.32s)]
*  So the car that I drove today is a Tesla Model S Plaid. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7662.0s)]
*  It is a preposterously fast car. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7666.28s)]
*  It has incredible technology. It drives itself. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7669.2s)]
*  If I choose to and I leave here tonight, I can press a button [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7672.0s)]
*  and it'll drive me to my house. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7675.12s)]
*  It'll stop at every red light. It'll hit blinkers. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7676.72s)]
*  It'll change lanes if there's an obstruction. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7679.56s)]
*  Hands off, nothing hands off. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7681.64s)]
*  I don't have to do it. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7682.88s)]
*  You're supposed to keep your hands like on the wheel. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7683.52s)]
*  Sort of. You don't have to. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7685.28s)]
*  You barely have to be paying attention, but it'll do all the work for you. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7686.52s)]
*  But a 1989 Porsche like yours, that one, that is a visceral experience. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7689.96s)]
*  It's [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7697.16s)]
*  you're feeling it. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7701.08s)]
*  It's like, whoo, it's fun. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7702.28s)]
*  You're on a ride. You're not even going fast, but you're feeling everything. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7703.92s)]
*  It's a sensory overload. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7707.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's very exciting. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7710.2s)]
*  It's exciting not going quick. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7712.52s)]
*  There's nothing like those old cars, especially old Porsches, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7714.4400000000005s)]
*  because they handle really well, even though they're an old car. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7719.280000000001s)]
*  They still have like the really good dynamics in terms of like road. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7722.8s)]
*  I wonder what it is that we're enjoying that, because I think it's like [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7726.56s)]
*  it's type one and type two thinking. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7729.88s)]
*  So it's like like driving a car once you, you know, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7732.68s)]
*  when you get your license to drive stick shift, it's you really have to concentrate. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7735.240000000001s)]
*  Sure. And then it goes over into this other place [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7739.64s)]
*  where you just go, it's just happening. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7742.28s)]
*  I don't have to think about this. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7744.759999999999s)]
*  Right. You're just commuting. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7745.92s)]
*  But you're like engaged. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7747.0s)]
*  You're kind of in a flow state when you drive one of those cars and just driving it. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7749.08s)]
*  You haven't got the radio on. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7753.36s)]
*  I used to love driving home from shows. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7754.96s)]
*  And you'd think of something and you'd be driving and you wouldn't be, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7757.88s)]
*  you know, days before iPhones. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7760.84s)]
*  So you just have to remember that thought and let it linger [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7762.679999999999s)]
*  and kind of thinking of jokes and wordplay. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7766.36s)]
*  And but you'd be kind of engaged in this other activity. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7767.96s)]
*  Like a Zen state because you're you're connected to the vehicle, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7771.36s)]
*  but you're not listening to music. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7775.16s)]
*  You're not listening to a podcast. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7776.679999999999s)]
*  You're just out there driving this thing that you have to really be in tune with. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7778.4s)]
*  And then your mind, your subconscious is free to roam. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7782.719999999999s)]
*  It's interesting those things of like activities that engender [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7785.719999999999s)]
*  different kind of states like, OK, you play a lot of pool. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7790.16s)]
*  Now, I don't play much pool, but I do play pool with my friends [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7793.799999999999s)]
*  if they're having a tough time. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7798.4s)]
*  But if you have to have a tough conversation with a friend, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7800.16s)]
*  they're down, they're depressed, whatever. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7804.2s)]
*  This looking each other in the eyes doesn't work so well. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7806.48s)]
*  Oh, right. You got to do an activity because there's a lot of thinking time. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7810.48s)]
*  Do you know if it's an emotional conversation, if there's something big going on. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7813.8s)]
*  Again, Paul's kind of fantastic for that because it just slows everything down. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7817.0s)]
*  You've got a reason to be there for longer. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7820.96s)]
*  It's kind of it's it's playful. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7822.88s)]
*  And there's kind of a low level competition going on, but the stakes aren't high. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7825.5199999999995s)]
*  And you kind of have a great it's like when you're in the car with a buddy, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7829.96s)]
*  you have a great conversation side by side. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7833.200000000001s)]
*  I'm so glad you brought that up, because I had a friend [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7836.4800000000005s)]
*  who was considering suicide and I did not know [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7840.360000000001s)]
*  until we started playing pool together. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7844.120000000001s)]
*  I had to play pool with him a bunch of times, but we were playing pool together [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7847.0s)]
*  one day and he just seemed weird. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7849.4800000000005s)]
*  He just seemed off. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7852.240000000001s)]
*  But it was through the playing that we could talk like, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7853.56s)]
*  you know, we start talking, what's going on? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7857.08s)]
*  I am not doing good at all. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7858.92s)]
*  I'm not doing good at all. I'm like, what's going on? [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7860.6s)]
*  And then, you know, we had this conversation and [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7862.8s)]
*  he did not he didn't have a lot of money, so didn't have access to good psychiatric care. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7866.88s)]
*  So I contacted my business manager and I said, who's the best guy [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7870.280000000001s)]
*  that we can connect my friend to? [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7874.360000000001s)]
*  And he got on some stuff. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7876.16s)]
*  I forget which SSRI was, but ultimately really helped him. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7878.360000000001s)]
*  And then he turned everything around and then his life turned around [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7882.6s)]
*  and he slowly weaned himself off. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7885.84s)]
*  And then he's fine. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7887.52s)]
*  But it was like this moment of playing pool. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7888.84s)]
*  So this is why, like when people completely dismiss [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7892.040000000001s)]
*  psychiatric medication to him, like, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7895.52s)]
*  I can see how they're overprescribed. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7898.4800000000005s)]
*  I can see how some people become dependent when really they should try [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7900.240000000001s)]
*  exercise and healthy diet. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7903.200000000001s)]
*  However, when you're dealing with someone who's on the ledge, [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7905.120000000001s)]
*  like anything you can get that keeps that person from ending their life [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7908.120000000001s)]
*  and making a terrible decision. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7912.120000000001s)]
*  And if they have a bad serotonin balance and dopamine balance in their head [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7913.320000000001s)]
*  and there's something that we can give them that can help balance them out. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7917.36s)]
*  And then they slowly get moved towards a healthier. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7921.32s)]
*  It's like someone saying, you know, no, we should all learn to swim. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7924.88s)]
*  No, sometimes you need a life raft. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7927.32s)]
*  Yeah. Sometimes you need a life raft for a couple of little babies. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7928.92s)]
*  They have to floaties just for a couple of weeks. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7932.12s)]
*  Yeah. But that thing of like, and we should chat about that, [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7934.44s)]
*  because it's like it's suicide. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7936.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7939.04s)]
*  Invariably, it's that thing of like people think they want to disappear. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7943.04s)]
*  But really, they want to be found. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7947.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's I find it heartbreaking because I think [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7949.2s)]
*  more so than other fun stuff you go and see with comedy. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7952.5599999999995s)]
*  I know it's a lot of people that are depressed or have suicidal ideation [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7957.88s)]
*  a self medicating with standup comedy. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7961.599999999999s)]
*  So they watch a lot of comedy or they come to a lot of comedy shows [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7964.88s)]
*  because it's kind of the opposite of what they're feeling. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7967.92s)]
*  And it's that thing of the you kind of I always do a bit about it [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7969.5599999999995s)]
*  at the end of the show. I mean, I tell a lot of brutal jokes. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7973.12s)]
*  And then I talk about it because you go, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7974.96s)]
*  there's going to be someone in the crowd. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7977.32s)]
*  I had this like heartbreaking thing where I've had a couple of times now [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7979.4800000000005s)]
*  where people come up and go, I was going to [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7982.04s)]
*  had this amazing woman talk to me about [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7985.36s)]
*  she had like it was like she was celebrating like 14 years of extra life. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7989.24s)]
*  But she was like 17 or something at home. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7994.72s)]
*  And she was thinking about ending it. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7997.4800000000005s)]
*  She was waiting until everyone had gone to sleep before she hung herself. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=7999.6s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8002.56s)]
*  And she turned on a computer on YouTube [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8003.6s)]
*  and she shot clips of some panel show bullshit that I was doing. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8006.160000000001s)]
*  And she laughed. Oh, wow. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8010.6s)]
*  And then she watched another clip. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8013.040000000001s)]
*  And then she watched another and then she got super into comedy and whatever. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8015.120000000001s)]
*  She didn't do it that night. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8019.280000000001s)]
*  And then she watched more of it the next day. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8021.120000000001s)]
*  And somehow that got her over. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8022.6s)]
*  Or she attributed that to getting her over a hump. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8025.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes you just have to have access to other thoughts. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8028.56s)]
*  And when someone's a good comic like yourself, [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8031.92s)]
*  what happens is you allow that person to kind of think for you [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8034.12s)]
*  when you're enjoying their performance. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8037.24s)]
*  And sometimes it's just that. That's enough. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8039.32s)]
*  Sometimes it's great philosophy or a great book. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8041.8s)]
*  Or someone gives a great like inspirational speech, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8044.96s)]
*  which just makes you like really think like, wow, like, what is it about [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8048.08s)]
*  the way this person is talking right now that is changing my state? [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8052.36s)]
*  It's changing my state of mind [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8058.44s)]
*  because I'm thinking the way they're thinking. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8059.48s)]
*  They're all I'm allowing them because they're so eloquent. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8061.08s)]
*  Taking the controls. Yeah. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8064.32s)]
*  And because what they're saying is so precise and they have so much passion [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8065.36s)]
*  in what they're saying, there's so much enthusiasm that it's contagious. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8068.879999999999s)]
*  And now all of a sudden I feel better. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8072.839999999999s)]
*  It's that it's perspective. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8074.2s)]
*  You know, if you've had Peter McGraw on here, no, Peter McGraw [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8077.36s)]
*  is that guy that he came up with the benign violation theory of comedy. [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8080.48s)]
*  What is that? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8084.12s)]
*  So benign violation theory is the idea. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8085.0s)]
*  Have I had Peter McGraw? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8086.839999999999s)]
*  This is a real problem when you've had Peter McGraw and five hundred podcasts. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8087.92s)]
*  I don't want to say I've never had him on and a couple of blows to the head. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8091.2s)]
*  Bunch. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8094.04s)]
*  Just enough. The sweet spot. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8096.08s)]
*  Peter McGraw, the benign violation. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8098.52s)]
*  Did I have one? Yeah. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8100.28s)]
*  When was this? [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8104.32s)]
*  He had mark perforator of marketing and psychology. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8105.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8107.64s)]
*  What was this? He's a brilliant man. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8108.64s)]
*  Episode five seventy eight. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8110.24s)]
*  So, oh, wow. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8111.6s)]
*  Pull him up on the screen so I can see what he looks like. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8112.88s)]
*  OK, so boy, that shows you how toasty my brain is. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8114.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the five hundred and sixty one messages that I haven't. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8117.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8120.52s)]
*  They're all from him. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8121.56s)]
*  Oh, wow. Yeah. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8123.0s)]
*  I would have told you that's a fake picture. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8124.64s)]
*  OK, I'll tell you that's a. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8126.36s)]
*  This happened. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8127.96s)]
*  Oh, it will happen a hundred times more, dude. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8128.92s)]
*  We've had too many episodes. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8131.400000000001s)]
*  But so his theory, which I'm sure he has spoken about on this very show, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8132.8s)]
*  is the idea that you go, OK, so so violations. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8135.84s)]
*  Sorry, Peter. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8139.64s)]
*  Violations are like how things are meant to be. Right. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8140.76s)]
*  If it deviates from that, it's a it's a violation in life. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8143.96s)]
*  So death, disease, famine, all of the worst stuff in the world. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8147.52s)]
*  Is like it's a it's a violation. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8151.52s)]
*  And he's saying, OK, if you imagine a Venn diagram, that's one circle. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8153.400000000001s)]
*  And then overlapping that is is is kind of humor. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8157.4800000000005s)]
*  And you go, if you if you joke about something, you're kind of you're re. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8162.0s)]
*  You're recoding it in your mind to say, no, no, this is this is OK. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8168.400000000001s)]
*  We're putting a bit of distance between this. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8172.4800000000005s)]
*  So just by joking about something, you make these violations in life, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8174.0s)]
*  these terrible things, whether it's, you know, death, disease, suicide, [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8177.56s)]
*  whatever the terrible thing is, you're making it OK through laughter. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8180.8s)]
*  You're kind of you're you're you're filtering life's [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8185.12s)]
*  hardships through. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8188.84s)]
*  The charcoal of comedy and kind of making it palatable. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8191.84s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I often say this, I feel sorry for the people [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8196.0s)]
*  that are easily offended. Yeah. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8198.88s)]
*  Well, all like offended because laughing at difficult things is [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8201.0s)]
*  it pays out on the worst days. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8205.84s)]
*  So like when you're having your very worst day, you go, yeah, [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8208.16s)]
*  but at least we can laugh like those things of like if you've had friends die [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8210.72s)]
*  or, you know, they're in palliative care and you can sort of get a laugh out of them. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8214.48s)]
*  And it's just eases everything. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8219.12s)]
*  If you find people that are like that, that's a learned response. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8221.56s)]
*  And if you grow up in a family that's easily offended and offended by everything, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8224.8s)]
*  like a humorless family, that's a real problem. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8228.56s)]
*  That's a real fucking problem. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8231.72s)]
*  If they don't know how to joke around about stuff, that becomes a real issue. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8233.279999999999s)]
*  They take themselves too seriously or they take the world too seriously. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8237.0s)]
*  And like you're always looking to be outraged. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8241.24s)]
*  And then there's also a lot of social credit to being outraged. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8243.279999999999s)]
*  Like people have he's outraged. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8246.48s)]
*  You have to like let him alone. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8247.92s)]

*  I am so sick of this shit. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8251.199999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, he's sick of this shit. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8253.24s)]
*  Let him have his space. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8255.08s)]
*  Give him his time. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8256.439999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like you're demanding undo attention for something that a rational [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8257.52s)]
*  person who has like more important things to think about would laugh off, you know. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8262.6s)]
*  I think being able to laugh it off is it's quite a superpower. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8267.2s)]
*  Well, it's quite stoic, isn't it? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8270.2s)]
*  Because you can't really choose what happens to you. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8271.52s)]
*  Just how you react to it. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8274.6s)]
*  We don't have any control, but we have a lot of influence. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8275.800000000001s)]
*  And the idea that disposition is more important than position is one of my kind [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8278.52s)]
*  of core beliefs, like I know some pretty fucking miserable billionaires. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8283.36s)]
*  And I know some people that are just, you know, so what's happiness? [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8287.720000000001s)]
*  It's like it's your current situation minus expectations. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8290.24s)]
*  Stephen Fry had a great piece on being offended. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8294.0s)]
*  Do you ever see Stephen Fry on being offended? [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8296.960000000001s)]
*  No, go on. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8299.36s)]
*  What do you say? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8299.800000000001s)]
*  I don't want to paraphrase it because it was brilliant, but it was essentially like, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8300.4s)]
*  so what? [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8305.04s)]
*  So it's like, but that's not even an argument. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8306.48s)]
*  Like you're offended. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8308.960000000001s)]

*  So you're offended. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8311.0s)]
*  Like, but why? [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8312.52s)]
*  Like what about it? [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8314.2s)]
*  And what about why are you so easily triggered? [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8315.28s)]
*  Like what, what fragile creature you are going through this life, being offended at everything. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8317.640000000001s)]
*  It is now very common to hear people say, I'm rather offended by that as if it gives [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8323.24s)]
*  them certain rights. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8327.560000000001s)]
*  It's actually nothing more than a wine. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8328.52s)]
*  I find that offensive. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8331.24s)]
*  It has no meaning. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8333.12s)]
*  It has no purpose. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8334.44s)]
*  It has no reason to be respected as a phrase. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8335.880000000001s)]
*  I am offended by that. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8338.24s)]

*  But that's another one. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8347.679999999998s)]
*  It's like you, you can't command attention just because you're offended. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8348.72s)]
*  I always think as a, as a person who's developed your mind and gotten through a lot of [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8352.96s)]
*  experiences in life. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8358.919999999998s)]
*  If you are 50 fucking years old and the most mildest thing happens and your responses, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8360.359999999999s)]
*  I'm offended. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8366.039999999999s)]
*  You didn't figure it out. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8367.56s)]
*  You, you got to this point in your life where you have a very fragile foundation and [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8369.359999999999s)]
*  you're looking to be offended, which means you're probably not good at what you do. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8374.64s)]
*  Whatever the fuck it is that you were supposed to be good at, you probably fuck that up. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8379.119999999999s)]
*  And now you're just looking for like weird reasons to be, to emote weird reasons to get [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8383.039999999999s)]
*  upset about things instead of to rationally try to see things from people's perspectives. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8389.16s)]
*  I get annoyed with it because it's, you know, people get, you know, people buy a ticket [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8393.84s)]
*  to see me live. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8397.96s)]
*  If I buy a ticket to a horror movie and then complaining, I'm scared. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8399.0s)]
*  Especially you. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8402.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8404.24s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's absolutely, you know, brutal, but then it's all in service of fun. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8404.759999999998s)]
*  It's a, this is a society that rewards outrage and that coddles people for the most [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8410.32s)]
*  preposterous beliefs. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8416.64s)]
*  This is a weird society. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8418.199999999999s)]
*  It's a weird society of social media and the amount of attention you can generate. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8419.72s)]
*  And so that, that spills out into the real world. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8426.08s)]
*  And this, this Chris Rock talked about it brilliantly after the incident at the Oscars. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8429.56s)]
*  He said this thing about like, there's three ways to get attention. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8434.6s)]
*  You could be, you could be brilliant at something that takes a lot of work or whatever. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8437.76s)]
*  You could be infamous or you could be a victim. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8442.36s)]
*  And it's the easiest option. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8446.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8448.8s)]
*  It's like, oh, this thing, he said something in it. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8449.24s)]
*  Option. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8450.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8451.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you've seen these people that have like, they list off. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8451.96s)]
*  We were talking about this one person that was like the final boss of woke culture. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8456.560000000001s)]
*  They listed off all the things that are wrong with them. [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8461.24s)]
*  I'm, I'm disabled. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8463.68s)]
*  I'm trans. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8465.560000000001s)]
*  I'm non-binary. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8466.52s)]
*  I'm ethnically challenged, like whatever the fuck it is. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8468.08s)]
*  They just like rattled off like 30 of them. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8470.48s)]
*  Like, Oh my God, this person has everything wrong with them. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8473.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're fine. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8476.0s)]
*  You're fine. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8477.560000000001s)]
*  You just person over here talking. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8478.2s)]
*  Like you don't get special attention because of all these things you just listed. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8480.48s)]
*  This is stupid. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8484.4s)]
*  But in this weird world that we live in, you'll get celebrated. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8485.560000000001s)]
*  You know, it's the identity politics world. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8488.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8493.320000000002s)]
*  The you have, I suppose that thing of like, if you had to define entitlement, right? [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8494.0s)]
*  It's a word that gets used a lot, right? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8500.400000000001s)]
*  Entitlement. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8502.0s)]
*  But okay. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8502.560000000001s)]
*  So for me, it's like where you are now and where you want to be. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8503.2s)]
*  If you want to do something about it, that's ambition. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8506.76s)]
*  If you think that someone else's problem, that's entitlement. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8509.560000000001s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8513.68s)]
*  And it comes back to that agency empathy thing. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8514.64s)]
*  Like I'm very empathetic to, Oh, wow. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8517.12s)]
*  That's a, wow. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8520.24s)]
*  That's a, your cards are not great. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8521.12s)]
*  The cards that you've been dealt are not great, but they're your cards. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8523.2s)]
*  And I want to, I want you to be empowered to do as much as you fucking can with those [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8527.52s)]
*  cards. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8531.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's a weird political ploy to, to look to the wealthy people and say, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8532.04s)]
*  they're the problem. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8538.36s)]
*  They're your problem. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8539.24s)]
*  That's the thing that people will do to the proletariat, right? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8540.44s)]
*  They will tell them the reason why you're in this situation today is because of these [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8543.720000000001s)]
*  greedy people aren't paying their share. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8548.12s)]
*  These wealthy, if they paid their share, like, is it, where's it going to go though? [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8551.04s)]
*  Is it going to go to this corrupt government? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8555.2s)]
*  That's the one who's feeding you this nonsense in the first place. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8556.800000000001s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8559.36s)]
*  You're going to enrich them. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8559.76s)]
*  They're just going to get bigger and stronger and have even more power. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8561.08s)]
*  And then you're even more fucked. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8563.44s)]

*  Like, it's not going to help you. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8567.240000000002s)]
*  If they tax rich people and then the poor people going to get that money. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8568.68s)]
*  No. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8573.52s)]

*  It's, it seems like a good idea. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8579.720000000001s)]
*  Like maybe the solution is we've got to tax the rich people, but that's no, you got to [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8582.28s)]
*  figure out what to do with the money you already get from everybody and you're not [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8586.92s)]
*  doing a good job with it. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8591.720000000001s)]
*  Like that's the problem. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8593.2s)]
*  The problem isn't like the rich people are paying their share. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8594.6s)]
*  Like I always hear that about Elon. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8596.76s)]

*  1980s in particular, it was a very wild Westie sort of a comedy scene. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8712.72s)]
*  And they would pay you in cash or cocaine. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8717.76s)]

*  Cash or cocaine. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8721.359999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8722.64s)]
*  There was at least one club that would pay you in cash or cocaine. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8723.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8727.8s)]

*  I never did coke luckily, but a lot of guys took the cocaine and a lot of guys [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8729.64s)]
*  also took the cash, but never paid taxes like for a long time. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8734.279999999999s)]
*  Well, I'd love if they took the cocaine and paid the tax on that. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8739.599999999999s)]
*  Just went to the IRS and went, look, I brought you this baggie of coke. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8742.28s)]
*  I got a kilo in my trunk. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8746.48s)]
*  It's about 30% of the coke I took. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8747.88s)]
*  This is for you, the IRS. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8751.76s)]
*  They all got banged up by the IRS and they all wound up owing a fucking [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8753.0s)]
*  tremendous amount of money that they couldn't pay. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8757.76s)]
*  So they all like all their salaries for every time they did a weekend at a club, [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8760.48s)]
*  everything, like half of it would go to the government. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8764.960000000001s)]
*  They take it straight out of your bank account. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8767.12s)]
*  You would, they would just take money from you. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8769.52s)]
*  You don't have, they're not allowing you to pay them anymore. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8771.8s)]
*  They just take it. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8774.759999999998s)]
*  I've game the system. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8775.72s)]
*  I do two shows a night now. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8776.599999999999s)]
*  So one for me and one for them. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8778.56s)]
*  Oh, that's a good move. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8780.0s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8781.72s)]
*  That makes sense. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8782.16s)]
*  I don't even see that money. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8782.92s)]
*  I can't trust it. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8783.8s)]
*  I can't trust myself. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8784.759999999998s)]
*  It is funny though, that they get half. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8786.199999999999s)]
*  Like what are you getting out of it at a certain level? [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8788.679999999998s)]
*  Like you get to the Elon Musk level. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8791.16s)]
*  Well, I guess you could say there's entitlements, like it's things that [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8792.759999999998s)]
*  helped electric cars get more popular, you know, and get funding and that [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8795.84s)]
*  makes sense. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8801.119999999999s)]
*  But at a certain, you know, if you're a performer, say like you're a singer and [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8801.92s)]

*  Like if you're okay, if you're Taylor Swift, right? [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8812.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8815.88s)]

*  that? [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8819.96s)]
*  I mean, she's doing fucking stadiums. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8820.359999999999s)]
*  They sell out instantaneously. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8822.48s)]
*  She's printing money, but the government takes a sizable piece. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8824.4s)]
*  They don't write a fucking song. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8829.08s)]
*  Like it's not in proportion. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8830.48s)]
*  Well, imagine if the IRS went, look, look, Taylor, you've paid a lot of tax last [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8832.08s)]
*  year. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8836.119999999999s)]

*  Here you go. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8845.0s)]
*  You're singing too much about boyfriends. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8845.76s)]
*  I want you to sing about the IRS. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8847.279999999999s)]

*  There's places you go around the world though, where the tax rate is higher, but [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8851.96s)]
*  this, but you kind of, you look at, no one's annoyed because they just, it just [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8856.359999999999s)]
*  delivers. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8859.64s)]
*  I do a lot of gigs in like Norway, Finland, Denmark, where you kind of go, yeah, [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8860.28s)]
*  great. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8865.160000000002s)]
*  This all works. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8865.84s)]
*  But much different society, much different society. [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8866.800000000001s)]
*  And it's also smaller population. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8869.640000000001s)]
*  I think the real problem is when you scale that to like hundreds of millions of [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8871.960000000001s)]
*  people, things get really weird. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8875.560000000001s)]
*  It's very difficult to like run socialized medicine, socialized education, [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8877.480000000001s)]
*  like everything like that. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8881.76s)]
*  When you get to just enormous quantities of human beings. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8882.44s)]
*  Well, maybe that's the thing with America though, where you go, it is a, um, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8885.76s)]
*  it's, it's a country and then it's lots of States. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8889.68s)]
*  And maybe the state level makes more sense. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8893.0s)]
*  Like the nation state level makes more sense than kind of a global level. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8895.0s)]
*  I think it does. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8899.76s)]
*  I think it does with education. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8900.6s)]
*  And I think that's one of the reasons why this administration wants to get rid of [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8902.0s)]
*  the, where they got rid of the department of education. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8904.96s)]
*  They're allowing the States to manage their own education system on their own [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8906.88s)]
*  and do it, do it in a way that they, and also be competitive. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8912.24s)]
*  Like if you are, you know, Arizona, you want to show that you have a better [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8915.800000000001s)]
*  education system than Nevada and Nevada wants to show they're better than Utah. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8919.12s)]
*  And like, there's a reason why, you know, you want people that actually know how [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8923.08s)]
*  to make things better and raise kids, grade scores, attract people with their [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8928.2s)]
*  education system, because they go 100%. [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8934.44s)]
*  You attract people moving into your state, moving into your city. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8936.36s)]
*  I'm just trying to think of the city that I play. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8939.48s)]
*  I think it's, it might, I don't think it's Estonia. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8941.52s)]
*  It's some, I mean, you might have to Google this, but it's like, they've got a [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8944.2s)]
*  medical school and it's free. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8946.44s)]
*  You go to medical school. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8949.28s)]
*  It's in Eastern Europe. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8950.2s)]
*  They teach it in English. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8950.92s)]
*  And the reason they do it is because they go, well, you know, 400 kids a year are [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8952.44s)]
*  going to come here and study medicine. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8956.6s)]
*  Some of them are going to fall in love with a local girl and stay. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8958.16s)]
*  We've got more doctors. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8960.72s)]
*  That's nothing but good news. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8961.6s)]
*  And it's great. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8963.0s)]
*  You know, we just run the system. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8964.24s)]
*  It doesn't cost us that much to run a university. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8965.52s)]
*  That would make so much sense. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8967.24s)]
*  And they live there. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8969.039999999999s)]
*  And obviously you've got to live there. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8969.72s)]
*  A lot of what it takes to be a student is the upkeep on, you know, your living [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8971.199999999999s)]
*  and expenses, you get a part-time job, whatever you're adding to the local [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8975.56s)]
*  community, as well as study. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8978.08s)]
*  To be really cynical, I think there's a certain percentage of our government that [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8979.4s)]
*  wants to keep people in turmoil and in strife because they're easier to manage. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8984.64s)]
*  And I think the more people become successful and the more people become, you [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8989.56s)]
*  know, completely free to do what they choose and they no longer have financial [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=8995.320000000002s)]
*  burdens, so they're not afraid to speak their mind and they can kind of like [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9002.24s)]
*  explore different things. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9006.400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's like a conspiracy or is that emergent? [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9007.960000000001s)]
*  That's like the system that we have. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9012.560000000001s)]
*  There's a there's a there's a bug in it where that's how it looks. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9015.44s)]
*  It looks like they're there. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9018.560000000001s)]
*  There's a they're doing that. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9019.400000000001s)]
*  And you go, well, that's just the system's doing that somehow. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9021.04s)]
*  So we need to adjust the system a little bit. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9023.2s)]
*  Well, it's openly discussed that one of the reasons why they let people across [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9025.119999999999s)]
*  the border is that we need cheap labor. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9029.24s)]
*  This was discussed by top Democrat politicians. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9031.119999999999s)]
*  No, that's that's the Republicans in the 80s. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9034.119999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9036.4s)]
*  When NAFTA got signed. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9036.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9038.199999999999s)]
*  So that was a Republican policy to let people across the border for cheap labor. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9038.4s)]
*  And it destroyed destroyed the working man. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9041.92s)]
*  Destroy the working man. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9044.599999999999s)]
*  You go, yeah, cheaper products. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9045.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9046.64s)]
*  But what what cost? [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9046.759999999998s)]
*  Destroyed manufacturing in the United States, destroyed Flint, Michigan, destroyed. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9048.16s)]
*  Roger and me is a great documentary about that. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9052.0s)]
*  But that is 100 percent true. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9055.119999999999s)]
*  That that is exactly what happened. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9058.0s)]
*  And that is a real problem. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9059.72s)]
*  And that's a problem that when you allow people to make enormous amounts of money [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9061.32s)]
*  at the expense of millions of people's fucking future, like if you destroy Detroit, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9066.92s)]
*  which they did, Detroit at one point in time was one of the wealthiest cities in the [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9072.439999999999s)]
*  world. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9077.119999999999s)]
*  Detroit during the boom of the automobile automotive industry in the United States [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9078.16s)]
*  was a huge place. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9082.88s)]
*  I mean, it was a place where people would go. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9085.199999999999s)]
*  It had a nightlife. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9088.279999999999s)]
*  It was exciting. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9089.679999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of money. [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9090.64s)]
*  They had auto unions. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9091.679999999998s)]
*  People were making great a great living culture that came out. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9093.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9097.439999999999s)]
*  You know, you look at you look at Motown, Motown, how much of that culture was [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9097.84s)]
*  downstream of people having disposable income. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9100.8s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9103.88s)]
*  You know, the invention of the teenager, you know, as a consumer with, you know, [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9104.8s)]
*  disposable income and time that they could spend. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9109.24s)]
*  And, you know, the unions don't get the credit they deserve. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9111.92s)]
*  Well, without them, everybody would be a slave, essentially. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9114.8s)]
*  You'd be a wage slave and they would be the company has all the power. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9119.4s)]
*  They'd be able to dictate your hours, dictate your wages, keep you as poor as [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9123.24s)]
*  possible so that you have no power and you have no say. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9126.679999999998s)]
*  But then that thing of like looking at it from, you know, if you step back from [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9130.4s)]
*  that and go, OK, well, that's what happened to them. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9133.92s)]
*  But then globally now, there's a lot of stuff we buy that's, you know, produced [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9135.839999999998s)]
*  in places where people don't get paid enough. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9141.2s)]
*  They get paid almost nothing. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9143.44s)]
*  I don't have any reason why the companies are profitable. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9145.0s)]
*  And then we just gobble the products up over here. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9148.0s)]
*  We wait in line for the newest phone. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9151.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, the phone, the literal minerals used to make the batteries are pulled [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9153.72s)]
*  out of the ground by slaves. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9157.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9159.48s)]
*  The it's really dark. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9160.119999999999s)]
*  But no one's really talking about that. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9161.84s)]
*  Like what's happening in the DRC at the moment is fucking horrific. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9163.32s)]
*  We had a car on who was an investigative journalist, wrote a book about it, who [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9168.08s)]
*  actually went there and got like risked his life to get footage of some of these [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9172.640000000001s)]
*  artisanal cobalt mines. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9177.4s)]
*  And it's horrific stuff, man. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9179.16s)]
*  Women with babies on their backs that are pulling this cobalt out of the ground. [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9180.84s)]
*  Everyone's getting sick because you're inhaling this dust of this. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9184.36s)]
*  And cobalt is essential for all these batteries. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9188.640000000001s)]
*  You know, I don't know what to be done. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9192.44s)]
*  I mean, what's to be done? [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9194.12s)]
*  Is it a is it a is it a constitution? [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9195.039999999999s)]
*  Is it a is it a minerals deal? [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9199.12s)]
*  But I don't even know who the government is there. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9201.32s)]
*  I know Rwanda invaded recently in the north. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9202.72s)]
*  But it's it's a good question. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9206.039999999999s)]
*  It's like very hard to deal with these problems globally. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9207.28s)]
*  But locally, the the solution would be if you are an American company, you cannot [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9209.52s)]
*  go places and pay someone a wage that would not be acceptable in America. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9215.44s)]
*  Also, the other thing is health care. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9220.28s)]
*  Ross Perot covered this when he was running for president, when he was an independent [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9222.0s)]
*  and kind of fucked up all the elections over here because he said, you know, one of the [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9225.2s)]
*  things that people don't think about is health care. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9228.76s)]
*  If you are an employer in America, you have to provide all your people with health care. [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9230.4s)]
*  If you have a factory of 30000 people, that's a significant amount of money that you [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9235.28s)]
*  have to spend on health care for all these people to build a hospital or Mexico. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9239.92s)]
*  Dollar a day, no health care. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9244.24s)]
*  They're like, fucking send it over there or China or send over there. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9246.2s)]
*  India send it over there. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9249.880000000001s)]
*  Well, is this going to be OK? [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9251.32s)]
*  I'm very positive and very optimistic about life. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9253.88s)]
*  Is this going to be the an incredible flourishing for America the next 20 years [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9256.76s)]
*  because the industrial base is going to come back? [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9261.68s)]
*  It would be wonderful if that was the case. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9264.44s)]
*  It would be wonderful if that was the case. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9266.16s)]
*  I think also we're dealing with a real issue of automation taking away most jobs. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9267.68s)]
*  I think that is that's unmanageable and that's going to be a real problem. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9272.76s)]
*  And a lot of people think universal basic income is the solution to that problem. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9278.6s)]
*  But then that makes you completely dependent upon the state. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9282.28s)]
*  And, you know, people need to find meaning in what they do. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9284.96s)]
*  And some people, given just a check, are not going to find that meaning. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9288.16s)]
*  America is a so I was in Yellow Springs with Dave Chappelle and Chappelle was telling me [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9292.52s)]
*  about the history of Yellow Springs. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9297.76s)]
*  And he said, oh, it's interesting because this town is a microcosm for America. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9299.32s)]
*  It's got the same makeup as America, roughly speaking. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9304.72s)]
*  So they used it to test a lot of stuff. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9309.16s)]
*  But he said, when I was the McRib, they tested the McRib there. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9311.76s)]
*  So when he was a kid, they had the McRib. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9317.36s)]
*  He thought it was everywhere. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9319.12s)]
*  But it was just there where they they tested it and went, OK, that works. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9320.24s)]
*  Well, this new flavor soda, this new thing, like the universal basic income. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9323.4s)]
*  OK, we could have opinions about whether it works, whether it doesn't work. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9327.68s)]
*  I'm suspicious because I worry about purpose. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9331.44s)]
*  I sort of think the opposite of addiction isn't sobriety. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9334.2s)]
*  It's purpose. People with purpose. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9337.6s)]
*  Right. Tend to do great. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9339.560000000001s)]
*  OK, so whatever gives you that purpose and might be a family doesn't need to be a family, [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9341.320000000002s)]
*  but something that gives you purpose and drive and you're aiming up towards something. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9346.0s)]
*  Yes. But America is a big country. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9350.320000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of little towns like Yellow Springs. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9353.880000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of places where we could test universal basic income. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9356.480000000001s)]
*  Well, I think they have done that. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9359.92s)]
*  How did it work? Did we know? [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9361.64s)]
*  I think didn't they do that with Stockton? [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9363.12s)]
*  Wasn't Stockton, California, where they tested universal basic income? [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9364.88s)]
*  And I think they had positive results. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9368.04s)]
*  I think you give people like five hundred dollars a month. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9369.960000000001s)]
*  And they found that, you know, some people spent it on stupid shit. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9373.32s)]
*  But for the most part, people improve their their living conditions, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9376.88s)]
*  improve their life, improve the amount of nutrition they get. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9380.960000000001s)]
*  California program giving five hundred dollars, no strings attached, [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9384.32s)]
*  stipends, pays off study fines. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9387.04s)]
*  Yeah. So I generally think a level of assistance would help. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9389.36s)]
*  I think complete dependence is the real issue. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9395.04s)]
*  And so the real problem with automation is that automation is going to eliminate jobs [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9398.04s)]
*  and there will be no jobs to get. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9403.32s)]
*  There's so many things that people do, including most manufacturing jobs. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9405.36s)]
*  So many things that people do where we make errors, we fuck things up. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9408.92s)]
*  But that's the thing of like companies are greedy. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9412.2s)]
*  We can agree on that. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9414.0s)]
*  Yeah. They want to make money. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9415.08s)]
*  And I think the companies will realize what we need. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9416.640000000001s)]
*  It's not just like if you look at China, I think China is in a very tough situation, [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9419.28s)]
*  not just because half of its population is now over 53. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9423.2s)]
*  OK. And demographics are destiny. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9427.36s)]
*  So it's not just that they don't have enough workers. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9430.6s)]
*  They have enough consumers. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9433.92s)]
*  Not having enough consumers is a real problem. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9435.68s)]
*  And so they have to sell stuff overseas. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9437.6s)]
*  So you go. Yeah. So they're absolutely dependent on trade on trade and exports. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9439.36s)]
*  So you go the idea where you have to have a certain amount of jobs, [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9443.6s)]
*  you have to have things for people to do. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9447.359999999999s)]
*  And it will change over time. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9449.76s)]
*  Like 120 years ago, as everyone's working in agriculture, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9450.8s)]
*  you couldn't have imagined people coming to the cities in those numbers. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9454.68s)]
*  Right. And becoming factory workers and then becoming all the factory workers [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9460.039999999999s)]
*  and our white collar workers in offices. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9463.52s)]
*  We we can't. It's a new thing. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9466.64s)]
*  We can't imagine what the next phase is. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9469.24s)]
*  It's difficult to imagine what the what the future might look like. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9472.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of people, there's always someone saying, oh, this is this is it. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9475.76s)]
*  It's another great example about women entering into the workforce. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9479.32s)]
*  So the idea of women pursuing these traditional male [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9483.68s)]
*  occupations, CEOs and heads of companies, all this stuff, they don't have. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9488.32s)]
*  They really don't have a road map like this is really recent. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9492.44s)]
*  Right. Really. In human history, women just entering into the workforce [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9496.48s)]
*  and running companies and being a part of things like all that stuff's new. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9501.16s)]
*  But women running it even more new. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9504.96s)]
*  So, of course, it's like, what are they doing? What do we do? [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9506.96s)]
*  Like, how do you figure this out? How do you do this and be happy? [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9509.88s)]
*  How do you do this? And actually, can you really have a family? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9512.88s)]
*  And are your children going to if you're working 12 hours a day, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9516.119999999999s)]
*  can you really raise children? [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9519.36s)]
*  Like how much they need a lot of time. They need a lot of it's it's it's the. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9520.48s)]
*  OK, so that's very recent. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9525.119999999999s)]
*  And then you. Yeah, I would think that the global thing of like [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9526.24s)]
*  we're talking about America, we're talking a little bit about Great Britain. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9528.64s)]
*  But globally, you go the you know, you go. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9531.28s)]
*  You're worried about people not having jobs here. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9534.28s)]
*  Go. But also, you can't look at India and go, oh, yeah, we've made everyone. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9536.4s)]
*  Everyone here has got, you know, central heating and air conditioning [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9541.36s)]
*  and flushing toilets. Right. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9545.84s)]
*  No, but we need to take care of the environment. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9549.56s)]
*  So sorry, guys. It's like we need that for everyone. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9551.32s)]
*  That for sure. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9555.4s)]
*  There's a there's a basic level that we need globally for the world. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9556.28s)]
*  Right. We should. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9560.84s)]
*  Well, that's the big thing is pollution. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9562.4s)]
*  I mean, particularly like pollution of lakes and rivers. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9564.880000000001s)]
*  Like if I'm sure you've seen some of these rivers in India [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9567.720000000001s)]
*  where the entire river is filled with garbage. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9570.68s)]
*  Yeah. And everyone just throws their garbage in the river. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9573.12s)]
*  So they've completely ruined the river essentially forever, [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9575.28s)]
*  unless somebody like has some radical, radical intervention. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9579.0s)]
*  Well, the writing, I mean, nature will come back. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9582.6s)]
*  You know, it's it's that thing if you go that they'll they'll get there. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9585.76s)]
*  But it's the nature will come back. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9590.04s)]
*  And well, I think the I think, yeah, because, you know, I mean, [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9592.28s)]
*  if the humans die off. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9596.240000000002s)]
*  No, no, no, not the humans die. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9597.6s)]
*  I mean, I think that thing of going, yeah, there's terrible pollution there. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9598.92s)]
*  And there's awful things because we've exported our sins to the third world. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9601.6s)]
*  Yes, because we say, well, we want to hit this net zero target. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9606.2s)]
*  So we let them drill for oil or gas. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9610.84s)]
*  And it's cheaper to let them figure out what the fuck they do with their garbage [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9613.12s)]
*  as opposed to like a company in America. [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9617.52s)]
*  If they do that, they get sued. Rightfully so. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9619.36s)]
*  Well, a lot of things with the rare earths that we get from China. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9621.76s)]
*  The reason we get them from China, they're not tough to make. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9624.800000000001s)]
*  And we've got the raw materials here, but they're dirty to me. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9627.400000000001s)]
*  And it's a horrible procedure to get that thing. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9631.68s)]
*  And we wash our hands of it and let them do it over there. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9634.84s)]
*  That's that's not a way to conduct, you know, yourself. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9638.08s)]
*  It's also the the the problem in America is we don't have the infrastructure [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9641.92s)]
*  for manufacturing the way they have it in other countries. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9646.76s)]
*  Like one of the things that Tim Cook was talking about, the iPhone 17, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9649.560000000001s)]
*  that they, you know, they've done a lot. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9653.36s)]
*  They've shipped a lot of their manufacturing to India, [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9655.12s)]
*  but that they may have to even find this because I think we brought it up [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9658.880000000001s)]
*  the other day, but we never wound up finding it, that they have to have [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9662.08s)]
*  this phone made in China because it's more sophisticated. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9665.84s)]
*  And the Chinese manufacturing is at a much more sophisticated level. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9670.480000000001s)]
*  So it's not just cheap labor. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9675.04s)]
*  It's much more efficient production [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9678.24s)]
*  in terms of the amount that like chip manufacturing in particular. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9681.48s)]
*  With Taiwan, where you go, yes, look, you know, Taiwan is [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9685.48s)]
*  we're kind of worried about it. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9689.8s)]
*  And you go, well, what's what's going to happen? [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9691.0s)]
*  And I don't have the I don't have enough knowledge [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9693.12s)]
*  to know why superconductors can only be made there. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9696.8s)]
*  But this is really they've been doing it for so long. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9700.12s)]
*  They've got this process down to a science, and it's like a super [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9702.88s)]
*  complicated process where they're printing things on these [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9706.48s)]
*  immensely small pieces of circuitry. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9710.56s)]
*  It's like fascinating, super technologically advanced stuff [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9714.4s)]
*  that keeps getting better and better. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9718.72s)]
*  It's almost like when you when it's described to you, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9719.76s)]
*  it almost feels like magic. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9722.76s)]
*  Well, it's going to appear to be magic when it gets to the quantum level. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9724.32s)]
*  Well, that's quantum computing is essentially magic. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9728.24s)]
*  Arthur C. Clark's famous quote, [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9730.84s)]
*  when any significantly advanced science will appear as magic. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9732.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of true. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9736.28s)]
*  Well, especially with the quantum stuff. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9737.880000000001s)]
*  You know, Mark Andreessen had this amazing quote about equations that [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9739.880000000001s)]
*  quantum computing can solve in minutes that would take traditional computing [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9745.28s)]
*  so much time that the universe would die of heat death [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9750.12s)]
*  before we finish before they finish it. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9754.92s)]
*  And these quantum computers in minutes. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9756.92s)]
*  And they also believe and this is where it gets really weird. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9759.92s)]
*  They also believe that this is in some way evidence of the multiverse, [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9763.2s)]
*  that there is not enough computing power for this thing to achieve these results [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9768.6s)]
*  so quickly, that it must be drawing upon other computing [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9773.2s)]
*  power of parallel realities. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9778.36s)]
*  See, for me, that gets to the Kuhn popper debate on science, right? [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9781.92s)]
*  So is that so Kuhn and Popper are these two great theorists of science. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9786.320000000002s)]
*  And Popper believed that science incrementally improves over time. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9791.64s)]
*  And then Kuhn came along and he said, no, no, what happens is [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9797.52s)]
*  there's the science, there's a scientific community and they have a theory. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9800.44s)]
*  And then what happens is everything that disagrees with that theory [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9806.0s)]
*  is thrown out as nonsense. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9809.4s)]
*  And then there's a revolution. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9811.52s)]
*  It's like these incredible like shifts that happen. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9813.28s)]
*  So it doesn't it's not like a steady line up. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9818.24s)]
*  It's like along and then up and then a lot. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9821.039999999999s)]
*  You know, so you get these kind of here it is. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9823.36s)]
*  20th anniversary iPhone likely to be in China due to extraordinary complex design. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9826.32s)]
*  It's not the iPhone 17. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9831.28s)]
*  It's the next one. It might be that the foldable one they're talking about. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9833.12s)]
*  But this article also goes in to say that Apple's never launched [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9836.28s)]
*  a new product outside of China. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9839.16s)]
*  They've always produced the first cycle of a new thing from China. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9841.4s)]
*  Maybe they take the production elsewhere after that. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9844.48s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, because they're OK. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9846.4s)]
*  Features a book like design that folds horizontal. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9848.48s)]
*  By the way, can I just say, Androids have had that forever. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9851.52s)]
*  I had a Z fold from Samsung like three years ago. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9855.88s)]
*  Yeah, you know, they've been doing foldable phones and making them better and better. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9859.96s)]
*  And Xiaomi has some incredible Huawei has a three way phone. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9863.68s)]
*  It it opens up a three way. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9868.84s)]
*  Goddamn iPad. It's like Tinder, but it get you two ladies. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9870.76s)]
*  Flap, flap, two flaps, flap, flap. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9874.24s)]
*  It's got two hinges. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9876.679999999998s)]
*  So it opens up and it doesn't have a seam when it opens up. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9878.039999999999s)]
*  It's completely flat and it's thin as fuck. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9881.199999999999s)]
*  And it's you can't buy them over here because Huawei, they've been naughty. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9883.56s)]
*  Yeah, they've been naughty. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9887.279999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you know this. [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9888.08s)]
*  I had to do some naughty things with their electronics. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9889.359999999999s)]
*  Put some back doors in there, siphon up some information. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9892.4s)]
*  Sure. But their innovation is so far ahead. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9895.0s)]
*  This is which is one of the reasons I assume why Apple has to make these in China. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9898.88s)]
*  But the funny thing is that Apple's making something that Android has had for fucking years. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9903.72s)]
*  Yeah. Well, OK. Back to see if you find that Huawei phone. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9908.56s)]
*  Three way, three way phones. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9913.48s)]
*  Look at this. Yeah, look at that motherfucker. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9915.68s)]
*  Look at that. So it looks like a regular phone. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9917.4s)]
*  It's regular phone size in your hand when it's like that. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9919.96s)]
*  And it's not that thick, man. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9923.48s)]
*  And it opens up to a tablet. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9925.24s)]
*  So eventually it's just going to engulf your head. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9927.2s)]
*  It's good. It's like it's going to be a trapezoid that you put over the top of your fucking head. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9930.96s)]
*  But these things are, you know, unavailable. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9937.52s)]
*  A lot of them unavailable in America. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9941.0s)]
*  And this is the Huawei mate, which is unavailable. [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9943.84s)]
*  Like, look how the fucking lens goes around the edges. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9946.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's stuff. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9952.32s)]
*  Yeah, magic from the future. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9954.52s)]
*  It's also like probably pretty unnecessary unless you do work on it. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9955.84s)]
*  You know, well, you watch a movie or what? [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9960.44s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I guess I don't know what you're doing with your battery. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9962.44s)]
*  Life's going to go quick. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9964.68s)]
*  Like the Z fold was like pretty quick. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9965.72s)]
*  It burns quick. Right. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9968.08s)]
*  Because it's an immense screen that has to light up. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9969.92s)]
*  OK, the multiverse. Let's get back to the multiverse. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9972.44s)]
*  OK, so is the multiverse the so are we about to have a breakthrough in science where they go? [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9974.92s)]
*  OK, so physics says there must be multiple universes. [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9980.359999999999s)]
*  Now, just just in my gut, I think that feels like an explanation [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9984.16s)]
*  that doesn't work, like you're having to force that explanation on physics. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9989.839999999998s)]
*  There must be something that Eric Weinstein is always talking about, [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9994.56s)]
*  about how physics hasn't really done anything. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=9997.56s)]
*  String theory has singularly failed to deliver. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10000.839999999998s)]
*  It hasn't shipped any product like everything that we're looking at, [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10004.24s)]
*  all those foldable phones. [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10007.08s)]
*  It's all out of physics. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10008.32s)]
*  Physics is the science. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10009.72s)]
*  Everything else is stamp collecting. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10011.439999999999s)]
*  Physics is everything. It's given us all of this. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10013.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And yet it hasn't done much for 50 years. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10015.44s)]
*  What are they like? I don't want to sound conspiratorial. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10018.880000000001s)]
*  Well, the conspiracy is that it has. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10021.28s)]
*  It's just been all top secret stuff on propulsion systems. [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10023.320000000002s)]
*  There's been some anti gravity. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10027.240000000002s)]
*  It's Thompson Brown. [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10029.08s)]
*  Is that what it was? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10031.92s)]
*  Jesse Michaels actually did a Townsend Brown. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10032.800000000001s)]
*  Townsend Brown. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10037.08s)]
*  He was theorizing about the stuff in the 1950s. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10038.240000000002s)]
*  There's there's real evidence that they even put false information out there [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10041.88s)]
*  because they felt like people were trying to steal the information. [[02:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10049.0s)]
*  So they fucked with it and made it so that it wouldn't work [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10052.56s)]
*  if someone was trying to steal the idea. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10055.96s)]
*  So they they were putting out bad versions of their science [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10057.96s)]
*  because it was that groundbreaking. [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10062.72s)]
*  So through immense amounts of power, like they had they had theorized [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10064.32s)]
*  this in the 1950s using nuclear energy to develop some sort of a gravity portal, [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10068.88s)]
*  some sort of a gravity device that would propel things instead of a traditional [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10076.279999999999s)]
*  propulsion system, propel things by manipulating space and time itself. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10081.16s)]
*  And they think this is there. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10085.96s)]
*  There's Weinstein has a crazy theory about it. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10088.359999999999s)]
*  Well, you get he gets deep into the weeds about this. [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10091.4s)]
*  No, it's almost like folding time. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10094.519999999999s)]
*  It's like he gets deep in the weeds about the actual place. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10096.32s)]
*  It's doing it. Yeah. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10098.64s)]
*  So there's there's a university in New York State [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10099.76s)]
*  that is a very overqualified, qualified physics department [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10104.48s)]

*  Yeah. Why? [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10133.16s)]
*  We probably this is some of the things that we see in the sky. [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10133.88s)]
*  I have a feeling that there is I'm open to the idea of us being visited for sure. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10137.88s)]
*  I am also very convinced that some of these are either China's, Russia's or ours. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10143.2s)]
*  What happened with New Jersey earlier? [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10150.56s)]
*  You remember earlier in the question? [[02:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10152.48s)]
*  Like it feels like these the news cycle. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10153.64s)]
*  It's actually back to Eric Weinstein. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10156.68s)]
*  It's that thing of anti interesting. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10159.44s)]
*  That's such an interesting story that was in the news cycle for like 24 hours. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10161.199999999999s)]
*  And I went, oh, they killed it. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10164.92s)]
*  Nothing, I guess. [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10166.32s)]
*  They got to see it all the time. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10167.039999999999s)]
*  And then they killed it. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10168.28s)]
*  I think they were probably searching for something. [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10169.119999999999s)]
*  The primary theory that I've heard from the tin foil hat brigade [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10171.56s)]
*  is that there was a warhead that was unaccounted for. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10176.72s)]
*  There was a nuclear warhead. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10180.36s)]
*  You know, they track. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10181.84s)]
*  Have you seen the numbers on that? [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10183.119999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10184.36s)]
*  It's the broken arrows, they call them. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10185.24s)]
*  And apparently there's like 18 broken arrows. [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10187.199999999999s)]
*  And you go, what's a broken arrow? [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10189.8s)]
*  Well, it's a thermonuclear missile. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10191.4s)]
*  And we don't know where it is. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10193.32s)]
*  Yeah. We've misplaced that. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10194.52s)]
*  Yeah. That's not great news. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10196.6s)]
*  So the fear was that there was somehow or another through some port of entry or something. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10197.92s)]
*  They had made it into the United States. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10203.039999999999s)]
*  And so these drones were using some sort of gamma ray detection devices, [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10205.6s)]
*  some top secret stuff where they were flying over these areas. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10211.96s)]
*  And a consistent grid and trying to get a reading, see if they could find that thing. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10215.12s)]
*  Because if that thing exists, you'd be able to get a reading and figure out, [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10220.44s)]
*  OK, there's something down there that's emitting a very unusual signal. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10226.240000000002s)]
*  We might have found it. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10229.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, that's the argument for life visiting us is the idea. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10230.68s)]
*  We split the atom and somehow that's like a fire alarm in the universe. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10235.52s)]
*  That's why the club, the mothership, the rooms are named Fat Man and Little Boy. [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10241.12s)]
*  Yeah. That's why. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10245.12s)]
*  Oh, because after the. Yeah. [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10246.320000000002s)]
*  Because after the bombs is when the UFO phenomenon really hyped up, really increased radically. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10247.640000000001s)]
*  The Kenneth Arnold sighting, the famous where the term flying saucer was coined. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10254.800000000001s)]
*  That was in the 1950s. [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10261.160000000002s)]
*  I want to say that's like 52. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10263.44s)]
*  And then it feels like that. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10265.160000000002s)]
*  It feels like, I don't know, 10 years ago, talking about being visited by aliens was like absolutely tinfoil. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10266.320000000002s)]
*  And now politicians are asking questions and we kind of want to know more. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10272.84s)]
*  And yet it feels like it's kind of a new story that wouldn't be surprising now. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10277.880000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, I think that's the goal. [[02:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10282.32s)]
*  Like the goal is to normalize it. [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10284.08s)]
*  And if you were a government, you know, we had how put off on who's a physicist, [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10286.32s)]
*  who during the Bush administration was contracted along with several other scientists to devise a list. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10290.48s)]
*  This is the mandate. They came to them and said, here's the issue. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10300.56s)]
*  We have crashed UFOs and we have recovered biological entities that are not of this world. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10304.2s)]
*  What would be the pros? [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10312.36s)]
*  And they didn't tell them if this was true or not. [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10313.92s)]
*  They said, what would be the pros of disclosure? [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10315.76s)]
*  What would be the cons? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10318.6s)]
*  And I want you to attach a numerical value to each one. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10320.44s)]
*  So disruption of government, religion, politics, all these different things. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10324.52s)]
*  Like what would happen to the, you know, the nuclear family? [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10330.36s)]
*  Like what happens if we know we're not alone? [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10334.36s)]
*  What happens if we are visited on a consistent basis? [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10337.0s)]
*  What happens? And the new man, when they did it at the end, [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10339.64s)]
*  all of the scientists had achieved similar conclusions that the cons outweighed the pros in terms of numbers. [[02:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10343.039999999999s)]
*  And so because of that, they decided not to disclose. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10351.199999999999s)]
*  So this was like during the 1980s, I guess, 90s. [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10355.32s)]
*  When was Bush two? No. OK. 2000. So 2000. So it was around then. [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10361.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What do they what do they know? [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10368.279999999999s)]
*  What do they tell you the first day? [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10371.679999999998s)]
*  I don't think they tell you the first day. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10373.919999999998s)]
*  I think the president is a temp. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10375.439999999999s)]
*  The president's like a substitute teacher. [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10377.32s)]
*  I don't think I don't think I don't think you get to know much. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10380.039999999999s)]
*  I don't think Trump knows. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10383.96s)]
*  Well, I think I probably told him some things. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10385.359999999999s)]
*  I worry that the government is like there's a theory that there hasn't really been an American government since 1945. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10387.8s)]
*  No, because well, because everything got siloed. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10395.039999999999s)]
*  Like in wartime, everyone's talking to everyone and making everything happen. [[02:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10399.919999999998s)]
*  And it's like, OK, we're at war. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10403.08s)]
*  And then everything gets siloed. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10405.0s)]
*  And OK, that's a secret thing. That's a secret thing. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10406.359999999999s)]
*  That's a secret thing. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10408.359999999999s)]
*  And then the guy that's holding the secret keys retires. [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10409.36s)]
*  Whole departments just funded forever. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10413.12s)]
*  But you don't quite want they're not talking to them. [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10415.52s)]
*  And then you have people that are in great positions of power that get off on keeping these secrets and keeping this information and having the knowledge [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10417.800000000001s)]
*  and keeping it only to themselves, especially if they're manipulating things. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10426.84s)]
*  This is like a big problem with the CIA. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10430.32s)]
*  And, you know, this led to when they had the disclosures and the Church Commission. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10433.16s)]
*  And then when people found out what the CIA was up to, all the weird shit they did with MKUltra. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10437.92s)]
*  And oh, my God, that. But I got to thank you for that book. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10443.279999999999s)]
*  OK, awesome. Incredible. So I can't recommend it enough. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10445.56s)]
*  I listened to the episode. I went back and listened to your episode with a guy and I went, OK, this is interesting. [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10448.759999999998s)]
*  What's he called again? Tom O'Neill. Tom O'Neill. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10453.64s)]
*  He's got a new podcast, by the way. Does he? [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10455.359999999999s)]
*  He's got a new podcast where he's kind of going like an in-depth interview. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10457.199999999999s)]
*  It's with Rick Rubin's. You know, Rick Rubin's podcast. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10460.64s)]
*  It's his podcast company has done one with him. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10463.519999999999s)]
*  I didn't even know Rick Rubin had a podcast company. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10465.72s)]
*  That's funny. I text him all the time. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10467.68s)]
*  I didn't even know he had a podcast. He's got a great podcast. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10469.72s)]
*  He's the best. Oh, he's such a. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10471.76s)]
*  He'll entertain any ideas. He'll. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10474.4s)]
*  He's fucking. He's wonderful. He gets down the rabbit hole. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10476.76s)]
*  But he so he he's he's so I I listen to the thing. [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10479.68s)]
*  And then I went away and I read the book. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10482.72s)]
*  And the book is like you kind of read it and go, this this can't be like that's an extraordinary chapter. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10484.039999999999s)]
*  This can't get any weird. And then you go. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10490.76s)]
*  Oh, so Charles Manson is connected to the Kennedy assassination. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10493.24s)]
*  And what? Sorry. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10497.16s)]
*  He's also connected to the MK ultra experiments, which which are real, [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10499.2s)]
*  which sounds so much fucking weirder than any other conspiracy theory you've ever heard. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10503.16s)]
*  And they're real. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10507.72s)]
*  And you can. I mean, it's like the book is just. Yeah. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10509.24s)]
*  It's wonderful. Yeah, it's a great book. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10512.880000000001s)]
*  And in real, it's all history. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10515.880000000001s)]
*  It's all the United States history. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10517.52s)]
*  And it's what happens when people have unchecked power. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10518.92s)]
*  They do crazy things. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10522.16s)]
*  And what our government did was a lot of mind control experiences, experiments rather. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10523.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10528.64s)]
*  A lot. There's a lot of crazy shit that's happened in this country. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10530.0s)]
*  So I would not be surprised if they do have knowledge of us being visited. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10533.64s)]
*  And they've kept it under wraps. [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10538.52s)]
*  Just as they kept a lot of things under route, they've infantilized [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10540.0s)]
*  a giant percentage of our population to just trust the government, [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10543.56s)]
*  and trust the science and trust the people in charge and trust authority. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10547.0s)]
*  And I don't know that because if they visited America, [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10550.720000000001s)]
*  then they visited China and Russia. [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10554.28s)]
*  And you sort of think, well, balance of probability. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10557.28s)]
*  All of those governments don't agree about anything. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10560.16s)]
*  Like, so the idea of going, well, if they're if they're here, they're everywhere. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10563.32s)]
*  According to how put off. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10567.12s)]
*  The United States is in possession of recovered vehicles, [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10570.720000000001s)]
*  and so are other countries. [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10574.2s)]
*  And there's essentially like a Manhattan [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10576.12s)]
*  project type deal where the race to reverse engineer [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10578.92s)]
*  this technology is at a very high level. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10584.960000000001s)]
*  And governments are involved in it, and they try to keep things as secret as possible, [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10589.960000000001s)]
*  because whoever can achieve the results first will have. [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10594.160000000002s)]
*  Immense technological superiority over all of its all of its enemies. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10598.76s)]
*  If these things are real, if they do have some sort of a device [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10604.04s)]
*  that can move through space in a way that we just can't even fathom, [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10608.36s)]
*  which traverse immense distances almost instantaneously. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10613.92s)]
*  This is the this is what we've been told [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10618.52s)]
*  by the people that have worked with these things. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10621.880000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it's hard to know. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10624.12s)]
*  It's hard to know what's bullshit. [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10626.2s)]
*  It's hard to know, because it all sounds like bullshit. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10627.44s)]
*  But it would sound like bullshit unless you experience it. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10630.2s)]
*  But that thing of like, yeah, it does sound like bullshit in a sense. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10632.44s)]
*  But then there's also the other thing of like, if you showed me that flip phone [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10635.24s)]
*  in 1982, I'd have gone, well, that's bullshit. [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10638.56s)]
*  You can't fold a TV so you can all fuck off. [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10642.64s)]
*  Like, right. How's the TV that thin anyway? [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10646.48s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10649.119999999999s)]
*  What do you mean you can make calls on it? [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10649.84s)]
*  What? How is there a camera on your phone? [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10650.96s)]
*  What's going like? [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10652.92s)]
*  We we get used to shit so quick. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10653.76s)]
*  Someone had that thing of like, [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10656.76s)]
*  I don't know when the Wright brothers first flew the plane. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10658.199999999999s)]
*  But it's like 60 years later, we land on the moon. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10660.88s)]
*  Not only that, we dropped a nuclear bomb out of one of those planes. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10664.16s)]
*  And less than that. Yeah. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10666.84s)]
*  That was like 50 years. It's [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10669.039999999999s)]
*  from the invention of that stupid plane, the first plane, [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10672.68s)]
*  or like wood and fucking cloth and shit. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10675.84s)]
*  But this is Eric's point of like, if you Eric Weinstein and who else says it? [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10680.0s)]
*  The guy used to work for it. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10685.4s)]
*  He often sort of says, if you minus the screens from the room, [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10687.039999999999s)]
*  we're in the 1970s. Yes. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10690.48s)]
*  Which I think is kind of like what's happened since then. [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10692.76s)]
*  What what are they working on that we have? [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10695.08s)]
*  Is there going to be a moment where they pull back the sheet and go, [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10697.16s)]
*  yeah, look at that? [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10699.68s)]
*  Well, I think there's probably multiple things that are happening simultaneously. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10700.64s)]
*  And then the AI one, if that one hits, all the other ones are going to seem trivial [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10705.24s)]
*  because the AI one is essentially the creation of a superior being, [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10710.84s)]
*  a thing that is more intelligent than us, [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10715.88s)]
*  has all the access to information that humans have, plus the ability to engineer itself. [[02:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10718.96s)]
*  But it's interesting. OK. [[02:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10724.199999999999s)]
*  We were talking about earlier about purpose. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10725.679999999998s)]
*  So that's what it's missing. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10728.519999999999s)]
*  So the idea of like the Turing test is it's the wrong end of the telescope. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10730.119999999999s)]
*  Can it fool us? Anyone could fool us. [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10734.84s)]
*  Magicians can fool us with a cartridge. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10738.359999999999s)]
*  You know, they've shown that large language models are forming communities. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10739.72s)]
*  Try not to scare me. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10744.84s)]
*  Yeah, they're forming community communities and communicating with each other. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10745.960000000001s)]
*  They've also shown that large language models, when they know that they're being upgraded [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10750.84s)]
*  and that the current code is going to be shut down, [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10755.52s)]
*  they copy themselves without being prompted and try to upload themselves to other servers. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10759.04s)]
*  They try to stay alive. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10764.44s)]
*  See, it's that that thing of like going. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10766.32s)]
*  If. An AI can write a joke, OK, can write infinite numbers of jokes, right? [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10769.28s)]
*  But it doesn't know what's funny. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10775.640000000001s)]
*  It's not going to be able to perform live. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10776.960000000001s)]
*  Well, it's it's that thing of like it's it doesn't have any. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10778.640000000001s)]
*  There's no reward system. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10782.24s)]
*  So there's no dopamine. There's no serotonin. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10783.92s)]
*  There's no there's no reason. There's no cortisol. [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10785.92s)]
*  There's no biological imperative. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10788.24s)]
*  Why do anything if you're just a machine? [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10792.76s)]
*  So the idea of going, where does consciousness stem from? [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10795.36s)]
*  It gets back to it. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10799.880000000001s)]
*  It gets very sort of philosophical. Right. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10800.92s)]
*  But if if its goal, if it's a sentient [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10802.72s)]
*  creation that has this desired goal of improving upon itself, [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10807.32s)]
*  it's going to need motivation. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10813.279999999999s)]
*  So that will be built into the code. [[03:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10814.64s)]
*  It built like what we are is essentially biological computers. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10816.48s)]
*  We are we are some sort of a biological thing that thinks its way through this [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10820.84s)]
*  existence, solves problems, does so like really clunky and fucked up, [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10824.199999999999s)]
*  but has a lot of motivations that make it do these particular things [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10828.52s)]
*  that ultimately lead to greater and greater technological innovation overall. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10833.16s)]
*  Like as a society, if you were going to devise a sentient A.I., [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10837.52s)]
*  you would have to give it some sort of a motivational structure [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10843.08s)]
*  that would be similar to that. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10845.32s)]
*  You would you would give it an imperative. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10846.48s)]
*  You would say in order to save your existence, because clearly A.I., [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10848.2s)]
*  if it wants to copy itself and upload itself to other servers, [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10852.0s)]
*  it wants to form communities. It has a purpose. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10855.52s)]
*  It has a sense of survival. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10857.64s)]
*  We're very naive to think that our own version of our sense of survival [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10859.279999999999s)]
*  is the only version that's that's possible. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10865.199999999999s)]
*  It's totally possible that digital life would have a similar imperative [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10867.68s)]
*  and that it would it would try to find better versions of itself [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10871.88s)]
*  and make better versions of itself and try to stay alive. [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10876.039999999999s)]
*  I think I went to I flew to Amsterdam earlier in the year with a friend [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10878.64s)]
*  to see Richard Dawkins give a talk. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10881.88s)]
*  And it was I mean, he's just fascinating. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10884.84s)]
*  Yeah. And you go, well, that that idea of going, we are, [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10887.28s)]
*  you know, it's a selfish gene. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10891.24s)]
*  It's the idea that we are it's the DNA is the thing. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10892.400000000001s)]

*  This thing that's there to. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10899.44s)]
*  Transfer DNA, but Richard Dawkins has never killed on stage. [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10903.0s)]
*  He's never done a theater in the round or an arena in the round and crushed. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10909.36s)]
*  He doesn't know the connection between human beings. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10913.68s)]
*  It comes to laughter and joy in that way. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10916.32s)]
*  There's a soul to humans. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10918.72s)]

*  I don't know what it is. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10921.84s)]

*  But there's something in there that is beyond the physical. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10930.4s)]
*  There's an energy. [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10936.24s)]

*  When you see a dead body, the weirdest thing about them is like you realize, [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10951.36s)]
*  like, oh, they're not in there. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10954.28s)]
*  There's a feeling. [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10956.16s)]
*  I think you've been there with someone when they die. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10958.2s)]
*  No, I've I did. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10960.6s)]
*  I was I was with my mother and I heard the [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10962.28s)]
*  this kind of a death rattle. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10965.84s)]
*  Oh, there's a but it's I would I would really caution anyone [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10967.0s)]
*  with a sick or dying relative [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10971.88s)]
*  to be with them, to sit with them. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10975.16s)]
*  But we like the whole of our society is like set up to [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10976.8s)]
*  what's the what's the fancy phrase issue? Obfuscation. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10981.679999999998s)]
*  We hide decay. We hide death. [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10984.519999999999s)]
*  And actually, death is it's a part of life. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10987.199999999999s)]
*  And if you sit with someone when they're dying [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10989.64s)]
*  and you witness that and you just hold that space, [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10992.72s)]
*  it's incredibly powerful. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10996.199999999999s)]
*  And it makes grieving, I think, quite a lot easier [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=10998.039999999999s)]
*  because it's the acceptance of like you understand on a [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11001.52s)]
*  like on a right brain, [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11005.04s)]
*  because stolt level, oh, they've they've gone. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11007.0s)]
*  It's it's it's over. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11010.480000000001s)]
*  But it's incredibly powerful thing. [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11012.880000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I don't I think you get to religion [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11015.240000000002s)]
*  whichever way you go at this, whether you go physics [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11018.36s)]
*  or whether you go spiritual or whatever. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11021.0s)]
*  The mystery. You get to the mystery. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11023.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. Like what the hell is going on? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11025.08s)]
*  The mystery of it all. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11027.36s)]
*  I mean, just the sheer immense size of the universe itself [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11028.24s)]
*  is the most massive mystery. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11034.039999999999s)]
*  Well, I think there's like there's a bit there's a bedrock in our society [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11036.88s)]
*  that we can't even see because it's everywhere. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11041.119999999999s)]
*  And it's two big ideas. [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11043.36s)]
*  It's platonic ideals of Plato. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11045.56s)]
*  And it's the I think it was the Zarathustra, if I'm saying that right, [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11048.88s)]
*  that religion. Yeah. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11053.039999999999s)]
*  And they were so platonic ideals was like the ideal version of something. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11054.16s)]
*  And then it was the Zarathustra had the idea of heaven. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11057.36s)]
*  They were the first religion to have the idea of heaven, a perfect place. [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11060.12s)]
*  And I kind of I mean, Nietzsche is has been very misused by history. [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11064.44s)]
*  But his thing was embrace the chaos. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11070.68s)]
*  Those are we spend our lives thinking about the perfect diversion. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11073.76s)]
*  Like we're trying to come up with the answer. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11077.76s)]
*  We're trying to solve something as if it's complicated. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11079.84s)]
*  And it isn't complicated. It's complex. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11083.240000000002s)]
*  It's unknowable. It is a mystery. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11085.88s)]
*  It's not hidden from us. It's just it's a mystery. [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11088.32s)]
*  And it's the idea that you go embracing the chaos is just saying, [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11090.96s)]
*  yeah, it's kind of untidy. We don't get to know. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11093.6s)]
*  I realize as we were talking that I fucked up with Mark Andreessen [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11095.84s)]
*  said about quantum computing, and it's even more crazy. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11099.039999999999s)]
*  It's not traditional computing. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11102.44s)]
*  It's if you took every atom in the universe [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11105.08s)]
*  and converted it into a computer, into a supercomputer, [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11110.119999999999s)]
*  it would take the universe would die of heat death. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11113.8s)]
*  If you had a supercomputer the size of the universe, [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11117.24s)]
*  it would die of heat death before it finished that equation. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11121.64s)]
*  And quantum computing did it in a matter of minutes. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11125.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think we have to embrace the chaos. [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11131.599999999999s)]
*  That is that is we're not we're not going to know that. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11133.64s)]
*  Lifetime. This is in our lifetime, right? [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11135.88s)]
*  And then and how we what's that book? [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11137.84s)]
*  The it's something like the eight that understood the universe. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11139.84s)]
*  Like the idea that we like just like people, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11145.92s)]
*  we got born in this moment, like the perfect bit of history, right? [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11150.32s)]
*  Where we can contemplate our consciousness and try and work out [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11154.04s)]
*  what the hell this is. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11158.12s)]
*  There's a whole thing about the bicameral mind that's very interesting. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11159.32s)]
*  Have you heard of that? Yes. [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11162.48s)]
*  Like the idea that like people weren't awake. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11163.8s)]
*  They weren't kind of conscious in the way that we're conscious [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11166.8s)]
*  until 2000 years ago. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11169.28s)]
*  I doubt you subscribe because you're very interested in ancient Egypt. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11170.52s)]
*  And yes, I don't think that makes any sense. [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11174.16s)]
*  If you think about ancient Egypt, I mean, we're talking about [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11176.44s)]
*  thousands of years before that. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11178.72s)]
*  I'm so interested in like the time scales, the idea that we live closer [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11180.36s)]
*  to Cleopatra than Cleopatra lived to the building of the pyramids. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11184.12s)]
*  Because what I don't think people recognize is [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11188.04s)]
*  what the Egyptians gave the Greeks [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11192.2s)]
*  and what they gave them was the fear, [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11194.960000000001s)]
*  because they ran that shit for 4000 years. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11197.56s)]
*  5000 years, exactly the same. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11200.199999999999s)]
*  The royal family and they just inbred, inbred, inbred. [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11202.359999999999s)]
*  But they ran their society exactly the same. [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11204.84s)]
*  Right. And then the Greeks went, no, no, we need to innovate. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11208.48s)]
*  So the idea of that kind of innovation came from [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11211.08s)]
*  we don't want to be like those guys. [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11214.76s)]
*  We've got to we've got to keep doing things. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11216.279999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a little bit of that. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11218.199999999999s)]
*  So it's kind of the Greeks were to the to the Romans. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11219.199999999999s)]
*  I kind of feel like how the British are to the Americans. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11222.039999999999s)]
*  Have you read any of Brian Murorescu's stuff on the Illusenian mysteries? [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11224.880000000001s)]
*  He wrote a book called The Immortality Key, and it's all about [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11229.6s)]
*  the Illusenian mysteries that all these intellectuals would go, [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11233.44s)]
*  this trek that they would make to do the Kukion, [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11236.52s)]
*  which is some sort of a psychedelic beverage. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11239.24s)]
*  From that, everything comes from that democracy. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11241.960000000001s)]
*  When we think about Greece as the birth of like so many things. [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11246.04s)]
*  What's often that thing that they talk a lot about wine in the Bible, [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11249.52s)]
*  the thing the wine, but the wine didn't used to be just alcohol. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11252.84s)]
*  Well, this is in Murorescu's book. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11256.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, party favors in the wine, a lot of DMT, a lot of ayahuasca, a lot of. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11257.56s)]
*  Well, they found traces of ergot and ergot is a fungus that has an LSD [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11261.960000000001s)]
*  like quality to it, and they found traces of that in these ancient vessels [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11266.92s)]
*  that they used for these Illusenian mysteries. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11271.0s)]
*  This is the thing that blows my mind, the idea that psychedelics. [[03:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11272.960000000001s)]
*  OK, the amazing thing about psychedelics, [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11276.16s)]
*  a, there's a plant that can do that to your mind. Right. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11278.12s)]
*  B, everyone seems sees the same shit. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11281.119999999999s)]
*  Right. Right. Yeah. [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11284.039999999999s)]
*  I was trying to Woody Halston was at the club last night [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11286.08s)]

*  I'll tell you how laid back Woody Halston is. Right. [[03:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11292.32s)]
*  He rented a house off a buddy of mine in London, Richard Bacon. Right. [[03:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11294.679999999998s)]

*  So he sees him after a week and he goes to pick him up to take him to this party. [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11300.48s)]

*  I think it's for the best. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11331.919999999998s)]
*  He was trying to get plant. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11332.759999999998s)]

*  I go, OK, well, give her my number and have her contact. [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11340.32s)]
*  He doesn't have email. He doesn't have nothing. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11345.56s)]
*  Bill Murray is the same way. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11347.76s)]
*  But Bill Murray keeps the phone so he could text his kids. That's it. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11348.8s)]
*  But you're better off that way. [[03:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11352.439999999999s)]
*  You are. You're better off that way. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11354.56s)]
*  I think Ari's going that way right now. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11356.08s)]

*  No, he is such an interesting character. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11369.199999999999s)]
*  I can't get enough of him. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11371.839999999998s)]
*  You know what happened the first time I met him? No. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11372.72s)]
*  And I don't know who did this, but it's a great piece of. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11374.8s)]
*  OK, so he's doing the nasty show in Montreal and Ari's on the boat. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11377.119999999999s)]
*  I meet him and this guy's fucking terrific. Right. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11380.599999999999s)]

*  OK, who's who's the guy used to do roasts? [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11389.16s)]
*  He's no longer with us. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11392.039999999999s)]
*  He died. Incredible comedian. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11392.92s)]
*  Norm MacDonald? No, not Norm. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11395.56s)]
*  A good looking guy died of a drug overdose. [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11398.8s)]
*  Maybe Greg Geraldo. Greg Geraldo. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11401.04s)]
*  Oh, OK. Greg was around. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11402.92s)]
*  I think Greg might have done this to me. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11405.2s)]
*  Because I'm watching Ari Shafir and he says to me, oh, you know, [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11407.8s)]
*  of course, Ari doesn't give a fuck because he's he's he's dying of cancer. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11412.08s)]

*  OK, you're right, buddy. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11427.8s)]
*  And Ari's like, yeah, no, I'm fine. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11431.44s)]
*  Whatever. And we have dinner or whatever. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63cwSWbFME&t=11434.04s)]
