# Joe Rogan Experience #1374 - Justin Wren
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 30, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qGhSAeFV0Y)
*  And we're live. Hello, Justin Wren. Hello. What's going on, buddy? You got a book in
*  front of you? I do. What the fuck's going on? Oh, I just got a couple of notes. Look how
*  organized you are with your tabs. Yeah. I've never had tabs in my life. Yeah, this is actually
*  from James Clear. Have you heard of him? Atomic Habits, New York Times bestselling author.
*  I didn't plan on talking about him at all, but-
*  What the notebook is? Yeah. Oh, so you bought one of his notebooks?
*  Yeah. It goes along with his New York Times bestselling book called Clear, where you put
*  down your daily habits and then you just kind of can check them off as you do them throughout
*  the day. What's your daily habits? Well, I have a morning routine where I wake up and
*  where I'm at, I have a Peloton. So I jump on that for like 30 minutes right in the morning,
*  right when I get out of bed. Right when you get out of bed? Well, right when I get out
*  of bed, I do 15 minutes of breathing. Just breathing? Yeah. But I do like five minutes
*  of lifestyle, five minutes. I do that too. It's called laying in bed. There you go. Yeah,
*  drifting away. I kind of drift away for 15, 20 minutes. What kind of breathing you doing?
*  So just kind of focused where I breathe in six to eight seconds and kind of count the
*  in-breath, then count the hold and then count the exhale. So it's a meditation. And you
*  do that for 15 minutes. 15 minutes, three short ones back to back to back there through
*  head space. And I actually just got a new phone. I don't have the new head space downloaded,
*  but I have three five minute breathing techniques that are really three to five minutes each.
*  So sometimes it's only like nine minutes. And what do you get out of that? For me, I
*  think I'm just kind of setting the tone for the day and just kind of clearing my mind.
*  Instead of first thing, I used to be bad about this. First thing waking up, I'd grab my phone.
*  Everybody does that. And then it would be emails, text messages, notifications. And then you're
*  starting your day reactive instead of proactive. Ooh, I like what you're saying, Justin. I like
*  his thinking. Yeah. Wake up, do that. I get on the Peloton right after that. I try to drink a
*  liter of water. Now you got me on this layered superfood. It's a great thing to get going with.
*  It is so good. His coffee, particularly his turmeric. I love it. This is my first time
*  having that. It's always out. So good for you. First of all, turmeric is amazing for you. Fight
*  off inflammation and then this with coffee as well. So it tastes so good. Have you had the
*  hydrate? Not the coffee, but the hydrate. Is that another one of his products? I have not
*  tried that. Oh my gosh. It's so good. I should have brought it for you. I'm in California and we
*  had this already set up, but a buddy of mine walked across America for Fight for the Forgotten. He
*  heard us on the show. You know him? I didn't know him before the show. So he said, I'm going to walk
*  across the entire country for the Pygmies. Right. Wow. Yeah. Which was wild. He had already done
*  something a year before for the Paradise Fires. He's a professional drummer. Actually, you got
*  to meet him right before we walked in here. He's one of the cowboy hats, the Stetson. He's the second
*  guy that I know that walked across America this year. Mike Posner is the other one we've been
*  talking about coming on. Mike and I have been going back and forth. He got bit by a fucking
*  rouser snake. Jeremy has some wild stories. He actually just started this adventure coffee brand.
*  His drum company is called Beats from the Core, like Beats from the Drum Core. And then he had
*  Beats for a cause. And so last year he did it for the Paradise Fires. This year he did it for
*  Fight for the Forgotten. I can't believe how many people I know that have coffee companies. Matt
*  Brown, Immortal Coffee, Lear Hamilton Coffee, Tate Fletcher and Keith Jardine, Caveman Coffee,
*  Black Rifle Coffee. All those guys. I love the Black Rifle Coffee guys. Their stuff is shit.
*  Shit. Well, Shobbs threw Black Rifle. Yeah. He just got, you know. Well, we just had our team
*  loaded up. Actually the documentary team that I know kind of through you because they do a lot
*  of your Netflix specials. They do all my specials. Yeah. They've done everything since they're the
*  best. They've done everything since 2009. Everything that I've done. Positive Image, my boy Anthony
*  Giordano, who's a director of the UFC. He's the best. Yeah. He's awesome. I've gotten to meet him
*  a time or two. And then Brady I've gotten to spend a lot of time with. He's the vice president and he's
*  come to Uganda with me. He's gone to Vegas and Colorado and Texas. Hey, how are you physically?
*  Because you were saying that you had some crazy parasite. Yes. I have a lot of stuff that's still
*  being tested. So that's actually, well, first reason I came, I'll share a little bit of my last
*  week for if you went up to Redding my first time up to Northern California is beautiful. Gorgeous.
*  The river right there. So green. Yes, absolutely. I didn't even know that. And all the fly fishing.
*  Oh yeah. I've never gotten the hang of fly fishing, but I love it. It looks like it's so. Yeah,
*  it's not hard. You could get it in a couple of minutes. You're smart. I mean, you're an athlete.
*  You'd figure it out quick. Well, Jeremy literally walked from the Brooklyn Bridge all the way to
*  Redding. The Sundial Bridge is 3,100 miles. Does he know about flights? I think he's flown
*  to five hours. His story is actually really unique. You'd like it. He grew up with,
*  uh, uh, well he was put in like special education classes, um, because he had Tourette's really,
*  really bad trends to where he had these ticks, the way he'd slap his foot. Um, what causes that?
*  I have no idea, but he had these ticks and the stutter. Well, through this walk and through
*  drumming, he thinks he started to rewire the neuro pathways in his brain because he knew the
*  walk. No, the walk and the drumming. So he just did the walk. I just did it. But he finished the
*  walk and he said whenever he was playing stadiums, drumming, right? Like that's the, that's the
*  pinnacle of being a professional drummer, playing stadiums with tens of thousands of people. So
*  he's back there drumming and it's before his first time he's ever come out and drum that way. Well,
*  he's drumming. And instead of him being in the moment thinking about, wow, I'm at the pinnacle
*  of my sport or in that sport, but of my art, he's literally thinking about how he wishes there'd be
*  a day that he could grab the microphone and just state one clear sentence where there wasn't a
*  stutter. So he's literally back there. He's arrived or at least what a lot of people would say is his
*  arrival first stadium tour. And then all of a sudden he's thinking about just having a clear
*  sentence, um, in a conversation with people. There was something that I just read really recently
*  about a new treatment for Tourette's.
*  Hmm. Jeremy would tell you that it was drumming that really helped him because he went, he went
*  from Redding to up to Seattle. He was in the grunge scene. And then I think his name is Steve
*  Smith or Sean Smith, maybe Steve Smith that started the Seattle drum school of music,
*  the really prestigious school. They would send kids off to a like Berkeley school of music. And
*  then they would graduate from Berkeley and they'd come back and they'd hire them as their
*  instructors. Well, Steve Smith saw Jeremy and said, Hey, I want you to be an instructor at
*  my school. And Jeremy kind of laughed. I can't read music. I didn't graduate high school. How
*  would I ever be a drum teacher at the Seattle drum school of music? He's like, well, I'm the owner.
*  I'll coach you for two years and then you'll be a drum teacher. Lo and behold, two years later,
*  he's literally a drum teacher there for 10 full years.
*  What kind of a person has that much commitment to somebody that they say, I want to coach you
*  for two years before I give you a job.
*  Yeah. Wild, right? That's came as mentor. That's pretty sure. Loving him. So he was able
*  to start having fluid conversations. Then he did the paradise fires fundraiser. Then he walked all
*  the way across America. He fell off a 40 foot cliff, got surrounded by coyotes out there. He
*  was in Oklahoma and he came through our offices and then he ended up in the middle of nowhere,
*  Oklahoma and the panhandle. And these cops came by and said, Hey, who are you? Cause he set up his
*  tent and 90% of people that do this walk, they fail within the first 400 miles. Yeah. Oh yeah.
*  Well, he's still got 3000 people that do complete it. Kind of like Mike, right? They have an
*  assistance vehicle the whole way where they're sleeping there, they're being fed or they're,
*  they have some comforts and he did. He just backpacked it. So you're saying Mike's a pussy.
*  No, I'm not saying that about Mike. That's what I heard. I heard that too. I just said,
*  Mike has an assistance vehicle. He had an assistance vehicle. I think he had a camper, right? I guess
*  he needed it when he got bit. And so Jeremy didn't, he fell off that cliff. He was, he had
*  a mountain lion that, that, uh, I guess purred or whatever sniffed at his tent. Uh, when he came
*  out, he had footprints all around it. So he documented everything. Pretty wild coyotes, huh?
*  Yeah. Surrounded by coyotes. Oh, and a prison break happened while he was out there. He looks
*  like a prisoner. It looks like if there was a prison break, I'd be like this fucking guy. Well,
*  he told him, well, don't worry about it. You know, if you hear sirens, it's probably the tornadoes
*  because the, the, the bad weather coming in. Oh, great tornadoes. When you're tornado siren,
*  he thought it went off, but it was actually the prison break. So, um, first time they had those
*  in like 20 years, but it was the night he was right outside the prison. So he's got some stories,
*  man. And then for me, I came out here, I completed the walk with him. I did the last like day with
*  them. So 20 miles and I was sore for a week after just walking up and down these hills. Really? I'm
*  not a week, three or four days. You're in really good shape. I'm in good shape, but stop all this
*  guy about this guy. I want to hear about your parasites. Oh yeah. So what's going on? Well,
*  there's still more testing, but they did find something called schistosomiasis in me. So schistos
*  is from the tropical rainforest of Africa. Um, I think that's the only place that exists,
*  but it comes from these snails. And so, because I probably bathed, not because I probably,
*  I have bathed in the rivers there, um, been in the rivers going across. You get it in your mouth.
*  No, uh, they can get into your skin. I was real itchy for a couple of weeks there.
*  What that was, was some of the like parasites, I guess. Um, what'd you call it? They're,
*  they're like egg sacks or something that got on me. Yeah. Got inside of my stomach, my liver.
*  Oh Jesus. Um, could be potentially even in my brain. In your brain? Potentially. So, uh,
*  so they don't know yet. Well, they, uh, what's today? Today's Wednesday, right? Yeah. One day
*  I did my final exams and, uh, I did three full days with this doctor, Dr. Daniel Amon. He would
*  be phenomenal for the show, by the way. He's incredible. Two, two Ted talks, millions of you.
*  You keep, you're such a great promoter of your friends. Yeah. You divert and you want to talk
*  about them. I want to talk about you. Okay. Let's talk about me. What's going on with your brain.
*  I saw him because I kept getting jerked around by all these different doctors. It's this, it's this,
*  it's this, it's this. Right. And I've had numerous endoscopies to go look at my stomach because why
*  am I throwing up? And, um, one says it is an ulcer. Another comes out and says your stomach's
*  perfect inside. It's a little red, but like there's no ulcer whatsoever. Um, and so I have
*  schist. Oh, I've had an intestinal bacteria. That's really bad called Shigella. I've had
*  malaria three times. I've had dengue fever. So dengue was in me for at least a month. The CDC
*  found it in me. You've had this parasite in you for a long time now. How many months,
*  at least six, um, since April. And have you been able to train at all during this time? Ups and
*  downs. So I was at the police and fire training center of Oklahoma city and I was helping them.
*  There's some really great guys there and I was helping them and the fire chief ended up putting
*  me in the cold shower for like 20 minutes because I got so, they said I got like ghostly white and
*  I started, uh, dry heaving and I was just shaky all over. This is all from your parasites. Yeah.
*  Jesus. And so it's up and down. I'll start, I'll start getting in shape. I'll start losing weight.
*  I'll start, um, I'll start feeling good. And then I just crashed. I've had shingles five times,
*  Joe. What the fuck? Five times. And what can we do about this stuff? Well, I'm, I'm starting to do
*  hyperbarics, um, hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Um, got a prescription for that. And, uh, that's been
*  helping more than anything right now. Yeah. Um, I'm trying to have that morning routine, protect my
*  sleep, eat right. Uh, my wife helps me meal prep. I have juices all through the day. I have the
*  superfood coffee. I I'm doing all the stuff I can. I was on 28 pills a day for, uh, for four or five
*  weeks in a row. Just for this parasite. Yeah. Well, a whole parasite cleanse because they haven't
*  been able to parasite that they haven't found or that they haven't like, um, that's not because I'm
*  going so remote Joe in the forest. They think I could have picked up something crazy. So they,
*  they just did a lime Lyme's disease test on me. Uh, this was on Monday. So Lyme's disease,
*  they did a cheek swab from like genetics. They did, uh, hair. So they cut off like, uh,
*  six different spots of hair glowing locks. Yeah. So they cut that. My wife was a mom or
*  teasing me cause I was like crying about it. I was like, don't cut it here. Don't cut it here.
*  So they took six spots, uh, of hair samples from me, um, blood, urine stool samples. Um, they did
*  two different kinds of brain scans on me. Um, so they literally injected something that was, uh,
*  very minorly radioactive, um, in me so that it could light up all the different spots in my brain
*  activity. So where there's too much blood flow or there's not enough, um, and literally,
*  so one of the things I found on the scan, which I already knew, but they can test, um, not just stuff
*  for like CTE or mild traumatic brain injury and TBI before autopsy. Now these brain scans, um,
*  they can also test for, um, like PTSD. And so there's this, there's this diamond in the
*  middle of your brain and you're only supposed to have a little bit of activity there, just very,
*  very small. But if you have this, what they call the ring of fire, this diamond of red and white
*  being lit up on the brain scans that literally shows that you have PTSD. So I had Dakota Meyer
*  in here. Do you know who he is? Yeah. Dakota. That was an incredible podcast meant to text you
*  afterwards. He's an amazing guy. And people haven't heard that one. Go back and watch it.
*  It's one of my favorites that you've had Dakota's legitimate hero. But one of the things that he was
*  saying was that they injected him and this, do you remember what the blocker was called that blocker
*  KG or whatever the blocker was, he described it and he said it completely stopped his PTSD.
*  Yeah. Cured all of his anxiety. See if you can find it Jamie, just so we could reference it.
*  I remember that I sent it to my wife. She's in psychology right now. She's going to be a counselor
*  and I sent that to her because they were talking about PTSD and the teacher said,
*  oh yeah, that's been around for a while too. And that's what Dakota said. I think they made a clip
*  that Jerry clips guys did. What's it go? Yes. Yes. Yeah. SGB. SGB. Blocker. Ganglion. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That he said it just instantly alleviated all of his problems. Which is insane. I mean,
*  wouldn't you love that? The miracle cure, they give you a shot. Boom, your problems go away.
*  Absolutely. Didn't he say it lasts for like a year? I think he said six months to a year,
*  depending on it kind of, you have to have other traumatic. I'm thinking of doing it,
*  even though I don't have anything wrong. Yeah. I just want to feel great. Well, this is what's
*  crazy. Oh, and Dakota said that, but this Dr. Daniel Eamon, who's got like, he's a 10 time New
*  York times bestselling author and he's got a book about PTSD. And basically he was saying that, yeah,
*  that shot really, really does work. And people have been doing it for years. And with veterans,
*  it's one of the quickest. Do they think that you have some PTSD? Yeah. So he was saying this,
*  what Dakota said, you just queued that up where, or triggered that in my memory, where the most
*  common PTSD is car wrecks. I think that's what Dakota said, right? Yes. Is car wrecks cause the
*  most PTSD, same spots in your brain, that diamond of fire. And then it's something you can't avoid,
*  right? You have to go back and be in public transportation or get in your own car. Do you
*  have them from car accidents? No, not from car accidents. What do you think you have it from?
*  From some tough stuff in the rainforest, whether it's Uganda or Congo. We've had to flee from a
*  village whenever a rebel group came into the village next to us and they killed six or eight
*  people. And we're all fleeing across the river and these like little pygmy dugout canoes,
*  which aren't big enough really for me. And we're trying to flee across the river before the sun's
*  even up and there's like crocodiles and hippos in the water. And then, and then a couple other
*  really terrible things. I mean, I've, I've held kids that have died and buried them and dug their
*  graves. And that's happened numerous times. We've had machine guns pointed at us. I won't get into
*  that story too much, but we talked about that one of those stories before. Yeah. And someone,
*  someone I love was, or a bunch of people that I love were with me. And so that was really
*  tough because we were unarmed and we're being threatened. And so that was tough. And then,
*  and then some like childhood stuff, I think different kinds of abuses and stuff like that.
*  Yeah. Some bullying, some public shaming and different things like that. I think,
*  I think one bullying moment that I even kind of forgot about till going through this with Dr.
*  Raymond was I was in the locker room and this little guy named Raiden that I've been hanging
*  out with a lot. He was just beat up in the bathroom. I saw that video. The video that was
*  online is a horrible video of these kids beating him up, but then I saw him with you. Yeah. Yeah.
*  So that's been fun. What are you doing with them? Just man, it's, it's great. Perking up his spirits.
*  Yeah. You just want to, to, to rally around him. Surround him with love and support and compassion.
*  We're in the same town. No shit. Yeah. In the same town, Oklahoma city. So actually Jamie's
*  okay to play one of those videos that I saved. It's called Raiden videos. And it's the first one,
*  but just for people that haven't seen it, a, you and Dakota talked about this and you and layered
*  about the diffusion of responsibility. So it's called, yes. And people can just stand around
*  and watch. Right. Well, that's what happened with Raiden in the, in the urinal. Actually not this
*  video, but the next one. Um, this one's a fun supportive one. And then this one right here is
*  just a, him at the urinal go into the bathroom. I don't want to watch this just real quick. After
*  that there's, um, so that's him at the urinal. There's eight to 10 kids in the bathroom. They
*  actually think up to 12, four or five are just filming it. And he's got special needs. He was
*  born with autism deaf in his right ear. So he's got a, a hearing aid. Um, he's diabetic. He's got
*  diabetes in his family and he's been relentlessly bullied since he was nine years old. This is him
*  through the bathroom was on Thursday. This is on Friday after school, three kids jumping them,
*  hitting them from all sides for no reason, for no reason. He's a big teddy bear. And, uh, he just,
*  his mom said since her picking them up at school and kindergarten, first grade, second grade kids
*  would just walk up and hit them in the stomach or punch them in the arm. Okay. Let's stop. Yeah.
*  We don't have to keep playing it, but, uh, so, but it's really cool that you reached out to them.
*  Yeah. Well, they, they, I guess knew about fight for the forgotten and we're in the same town.
*  And so a dad reached out to Jim Stewart and you've met Jimmy's our director and, uh, Jim hit me up
*  right away and said, Hey, is this a kid that we could, we could rally around that you could,
*  you know, we want to do all this. We have a curriculum for bully prevention. And I think
*  character development is bully prevention. So if you have good character, you're not going to bully.
*  Well, that's one of the, one of the things that I've always said about martial arts,
*  believe it or not, like learning how to fight is one of the best ways to keep people from being
*  assholes, which is so counterintuitive, but it really is. Cause a lot of people being bullies,
*  it comes from a lack of confidence and confident people are generally pretty kind, confident,
*  accomplished people. And you, you know, yourself, so you don't have these need this need to improve.
*  If you don't have that insecurity,
*  they asked me to diminish it out. Right. And the other beautiful thing about gems,
*  particularly jujitsu, I think is that everybody kind of boosts everybody up. It's a real family
*  sort of camaraderie feeling a real, those environments, almost every gym I've ever been
*  to every jujitsu gym is good. They have this family environment to it. And it just makes you
*  feel like you belong somewhere and you get used to being kind to people and nice to people.
*  Yeah, even, even if someone catches you with a technique, they'll show you.
*  They'll show you, this is, you know, you left your arm here when you were transitioning. And
*  if you do that, it gets stuck. And this is why I can catch you.
*  Yeah. Humble hearts. So with, with jujitsu or with martial arts, if you hurt your training partner,
*  you lose the person that's helping you get better. And so as you help them get better,
*  they make you better. And it's this give and take where actually the more you give, the more you
*  get in return because you're making them a better training partner, a better person. And I think
*  martial arts takes it to another level. I've, I've done numerous sports. My parents, I grew up with
*  them being the professional or official photographers of like the Dallas Cowboys and
*  the Texas Rangers and the Dallas Mavericks. And so I grew up around professional athletes.
*  But what's so different, I think about martial artists and why people love MMA one, cause the
*  sport so pure and it's like a chess match and it's an incredible sport, but the athletes, they truly
*  are more approachable. And I think that they're more giving and compassionate and more community
*  minded and driven. Not that other athletes aren't, but just a martial artist are so more
*  because they've had it drilled into them from having mentors and other black belts that are
*  on this lifelong journey of even service to others. That's part of the black belt journey
*  and self-respect and discipline. And one of the things that bothers me about all this trash talking
*  lately, the trash talking trend in MMA that was really, I mean, when people saw how much money
*  Conor McGregor was able to make, it just became this promotion tool. And Chael Sonnen was a part
*  of it too. Guys just relentlessly talk shit about them. I'm so torn because on one hand,
*  it's very entertaining and I do enjoy it. But on the other hand, I'm like, man, that is the wrong
*  message to send. It kind of removes some of the beauty of what competition is. Like what the beauty
*  of competition is to people respecting each other, but being aware that they're going to have to
*  go to battle and they're equally skilled, equally trained, and we're going to find out who's
*  got the more effective strategy or implementation and here we go. But now it's like, you can't sell
*  a fight without some shit talking. It's changed from this martial arts thing to sort of this
*  promotion of this thuggish behavior, which again, hypocritically, I enjoy. I do enjoy it. When people
*  talk shit, I clap my hands and get a kick out of it. But I'm a dummy. One thing pretty cool
*  about Jiu-Jitsu, what you're saying, one, Rafael wanted me to text me coming in here that he wanted
*  me to tell you what's up. Tell him I said hi. Congratulations. Yeah. Bellator world champion.
*  Champions. That's awesome. Gagaro Masasi talking a lot of shit about him being on steroids. Must
*  not like the squeeze. Man, he is the most disciplined, obsessed, and yeah, just dedicated
*  person. That's how you become a champion. The way that he eats, the way that he's trained,
*  sleeps, schedules, everything around him being the world champion and everyone else has to kind of
*  that goal, that dream. Accusations of steroids with no proof whatsoever seems unfortunate.
*  All this Nate Diaz shit that happened, here's the issue for people to understand what happened with
*  Nate Diaz. Nate Diaz tested positive for a trace element of something called SARM, S-A-R-M. It's
*  a type of, it's basically a performance-analyzing substance, but it existed in a minuscule trace
*  amount in a vegan vitamin supplement. The reason these things are being found is that the tests
*  that they can run now, the USADA testing, the equipment is so powerful. It's so much more
*  powerful than it's ever been before that the problem is they're working with tools that are
*  almost too good. So instead of catching people cheating, they're catching people that just have
*  come into contact with something that's illegal. It might've been like the tiniest amount that was
*  in a bin that they also used to mix these vitamins. They didn't clean it properly. Minuscule,
*  parts per million. It's a little tiny amount, but these USADA machines will pick that shit up.
*  So then it looks like someone like Nate Diaz, who everybody, there's some people that are
*  beyond reproach. Nate Diaz is one of those. You know he's never been on anything. Never. He's not
*  cheating at all. That's enhanced his performance. I don't even think, yeah, well maybe we does,
*  but I don't even think he eats meat. I mean, I think he's very clean with his diet. I think
*  he just eats, I know he's eaten fish in the past. There's a Vice video of him out eating with
*  Bourdain and they're eating fish. I don't know if he still eats fish, but he's very clean with his
*  diet and very clean with his supplements and what he eats. Right. Well, you talking about Jiu-Jitsu
*  and Raphael and just martial arts, how it teaches you that character development. You're going to
*  like this. I got you a couple of gifts, my man. I don't know if you ever seen someone come in
*  with a suitcase. I have a studio. You have? Yes. But before you give me these gifts,
*  I don't want to lose track of what I was asking about your health. Okay. So what,
*  what are they doing and what can they do about what you have? So when you said you might have
*  some crazy shit, meaning you might have a parasite that they don't even know yet. Yes. So that might
*  be an undiagnosed or in blood, urine, blood, stool, hair and cheek swab samples. So it's possible
*  that you have something that like very few human beings have ever had because they haven't found
*  deep jungle. Yeah. How long does it take you to get to where you go? Well, it depends on where,
*  where we go. The deepest place. Okay. A plane from Oklahoma city to normally Chicago or Dulles or
*  JFK or Atlanta. And then we go to Amsterdam or London or is it Qatar or Qatar? I think it's
*  Qatar. Qatar. Okay. I think. And then we'll fly either from there to Nairobi, Kenya or Kigali,
*  Rwanda. And then from there you connect to Kampala, Uganda. And then from there you get a private
*  like missions or humanitarian plane. That's just you and the pilot. And so you take that plane
*  from there to you from Uganda to Congo. And then you land, you do customs and then you get back in
*  the plane and you go and you land on a runway that normally they have just cleared with machetes.
*  So how many times you're flying? You're flying from Oklahoma. Let's just say Oklahoma city to JFK,
*  JFK to London. Two planes. So two to London, London to Kenya, Kenya, Kenya to Uganda for
*  Uganda to Congo. And then you get in the plane again to go out to the rain. So six planes,
*  six flights at least five planes. How many days? That's normally two or three days.
*  And then 30 hours or something of travel. And then after that you get in a car and it could be six
*  hours. So where you land used to be in the rainforest, but you drive six hours now to get
*  to the rainforest. How come? Because it's deforestation so bad. The deforestation in
*  the last 25 years, they've cut down about the size of Texas. It's pretty wild. We've helped replant
*  4,000 trees, but that's not even scratching the surface. Who's doing this? Who's deforesting?
*  Everybody. It's a lot of Chinese, UK and outsiders that come in and exploit the
*  rainforest. There's a lot of mahogany in the area. What is it? Ebony. There's a lot of rubber
*  tricenses to do this. They just do it. They just send someone in and cut down the trees. So no one
*  stops them. So they just claim the resources they don't have on the border. They might have to pay
*  some sort of bribe or tax. They call them that. Wow. That or taxes. They call them that. Yeah.
*  VAT. That's the Ugandan way to say taxes. Then from there, that drive that's six hours,
*  sometimes it's taken 25 hours one time and another time it took 47. Same drive. 47?
*  Why did it take 47? Oh, I think we helped get 40 something cars out of the way that were stuck in
*  the mud. So it's really silty there. You don't call Congo roads roads. I've never been on Tarmac
*  in Congo. Actually, that's why I have been in on cement in Goma. But outside of Goma, there are no
*  concrete roads anywhere. Tarmac roads. So I've seen an 18 wheeler or lorry, three fourths of the
*  way sunk to where it's up to their window, the driver's side window up to silt. And now they get
*  it out. I don't know that one. That one was just kind of in the graveyard. That one was like done.
*  No one's getting that thing out. Really? Yeah. So you just go around. I mean, you're going around
*  mountains and you look down to the side and you'll see four, eight, 12 vehicles that have
*  flipped off. Oh, fuck this. Justin. I'm getting them. Damn it. There's some vice videos of the
*  craziest roads in the world. A lot of them are in Congo. Some say Rwanda because there's so many
*  hills. It's the land of 1000 hills. And so there's so many sharp turns and they take those turns at
*  40 5060 miles. And so they'll literally just fly off the mountain. And so you catch this
*  parasite. You've gone through all these tests. I mean, this has been, I mean, we've been talking
*  about on the podcast for several months now. So for me hearing that you're still dealing with it
*  is really disturbing. What can they do about this? What are they going to do? I think getting off
*  that cleanse. I mean, I was on 28 pills for four weeks, maybe five weeks. And some of it were like
*  antibiotics, but I have to stay away from certain antibiotics. Here's the thing. A couple of things
*  that I know I have PTSD because of my brain scans. And then they see in my brain toxicity.
*  And so the toxicity in my brain, which kind of form these little divots, but not really divots.
*  It's not really changing the biology or makeup of my brain, but it's just activity of my brain
*  isn't fully developed right there where or it's, it's being toxins are there that are either from
*  mefloquine or from Cipro. Have you heard of Cipro? What is my city? What's the first one?
*  Methyloquin. What is that stuff? That's a malaria drug. Oh, geez. So no,
*  Larry, a drug take for any reason. Really? That used to be the drug of choice for a military.
*  Now tens of thousands of our military veterans, if you look up mefloquine toxicity,
*  military times, they've done two articles. One was just a month or two ago.
*  But the first one showed that tens of thousands of our military veterans have wrongly been
*  diagnosed with PTSD. And it's been because of this mefloquine. So they never saw war,
*  the mefloquine toxicity of the brain. It's like this poison for your brain.
*  And if you've taken it for like six months, you can have it. It starts giving you bad nightmares.
*  You can have different kinds of mood swings and different stuff, health, joint aches, fatigue,
*  all sorts of different things. But basically what mefloquine toxicity of the brain does,
*  well, tens of thousands have been wrongly diagnosed with it when they take it for once a week. So you
*  take the pill once a week. And that was why it was our drug of choice. Instead of it being every day
*  or two times a day, you just take it once a week. Well, when I had malaria, the three times,
*  I was allergic to the normal malaria medication, quinine and artifan and some other drugs like
*  doxycycline and malarone. I wasn't responding to those well. I was vomiting. I was allergic to them.
*  So mefloquine, my body digested the best or I just took it the best. So the three times
*  of had malaria, they gave me two in the morning, two midday and two at night. And so I'm taking six
*  in a day for five to seven days. And these other guys that were getting mefloquine toxicity were
*  taking it once a week for six months. So I had 30 to 42 in a week's time. I had six months in a
*  week's time. And I did that three different times. Why are they giving you so much? It was what my
*  body was responding to against malaria. The first time I lost 33 pounds in five days. And so as
*  Vommi red and green blood and bio, I lost most of my hearing, my peripheral vision started disappearing.
*  I had some called blackwater fever where my urine was literally as dark as that that black clock.
*  Take pictures of it. I didn't. I probably should have. It freaked me out. Five days I didn't
*  urinate. And then when I finally did, if you Google blackwater fever, one in four, one in two
*  people that get it, they die. You didn't urinate for how many five days, five days. I couldn't be.
*  Oh my God. They were trying to get IVs in me. My veins were collapsing. Oh, Jesus. So that was,
*  that was pretty brutal. Um, but yeah, man. So, uh, I'm getting my health better there cause I do
*  want to fight again. How can you, if you have this stuff in your brain, I'm journaling my road to
*  recovery. But if they don't know what this parasite is, how are they treating it? Like what are they,
*  how are they going to get hopefully they don't find anything. Cause I just got off those rounds
*  of, uh, so they're testing me for Lyme disease. They're testing me for all these kinds of parasites,
*  amoebas, bacterias, you can get Lyme disease in the Congo. Well, I've, I've been camping out here
*  and I've gotten like a bit by five or 10 or something like that. So, um, but yeah, there,
*  there's these wicked kind of ticks. Um, my record is pulling five roaches out of my beard in one
*  night. So there's tons of bugs there. Do you know, does they have, does Oklahoma have that
*  Rocky mountain? Uh, I think so. No, not that, not the one that gives you a allergy. Have you had that
*  one? I've been bit by that one. I don't think I have a meat allergy though. I hope not. Yeah,
*  that's a crazy one. Um, what is it called? Alpha gal, alpha galactose. It's a, something that
*  is the reaction that this tick bite gives you. It makes you allergic to this specific element
*  in red meat. Wow. Yeah. You can only eat fish and like, if you try to eat meat, you'll get really
*  sick. Wow. It's crazy. That is crazy. But they're, they're trying to figure it out. Why this is going
*  to be crazy. Um, why I'm 32 and I've had shingles five times. Uh, what my first time I got malaria,
*  I don't know if you can see the white in my beard over here, but I got white in my beard.
*  The first time I had malaria, the second time I had malaria, I had white come out in my beard
*  down here. So your body's just freaking out. Yeah. So then now I've got shingles, um, five times.
*  And then this is going to sound crazy, but I know I have to have a, uh, this might be too much
*  information, but I know I have to have a bowel movement whenever my nose starts running.
*  So literally whenever I have to go, my nose starts running and running and running and running.
*  How is that connected? I don't know. That's what they're looking into.
*  Like that. That's it. It's your second brain. And so it's, it, I don't know, it's digestion.
*  What's your stomach is your second brain. They said, Oh, that's got more in your gut. Trust your
*  gut. Yeah. It's got literally more neurons in your stomach than in your brain. Really? Uh,
*  that's what the doctor was saying. I know that's the case with your heart as well, right? There's
*  a bunch of neurons in your heart that, uh, they're realizing now, like that whole idea of trusting
*  your heart, trusting your gut, like these, uh, these thought processes that people had might have
*  actually been based on some intuitive understanding of how the body actually works. It's really weird.
*  It is weird. Really weird. Strange. Everything, everything's connected, right? Yeah.
*  That's not weird. Really? Okay. I mean, it makes sense over time. And the doctors in Oklahoma are
*  like, we have no explanation for that. And then the doctors out here were like, Oh, that's because
*  this is connected to this. And they did all my blood work. Even though they did more blood labs
*  before I ever came out here, like a week or two ago, they still poked me five more times to get
*  more blood work. Uh, because well, three times they were drawing blood, two times they were putting
*  that stuff in me so they could do the brain. So you're getting better doctors out here. Yeah.
*  More informed. Yeah. More informed. And then, um, and man, have you heard of hyperbarics?
*  Yes. I know, um, you're right. Faber used it quite a bit after his fight with Jose Aldo.
*  Yeah. When Aldo fucked his leg up, his legs swole up real bad. I'm telling you, this is
*  one of the biggest game changers. I love the float, uh, go and float tanks. I've done it at
*  least 50 times, um, at float. Okay. See in Oklahoma, my wife and I, that's our date night
*  once a week we go and we do that. Um, and I float fight week at least twice a week.
*  I really believe in floating. Um, hyperbarics is unlike anything I've ever done and felt immediate
*  long lasting benefits from. Like how so what does it make you feel? I get better sleep than I've
*  ever gotten. That was instant almost. I mean, I noticed it the first night, the second night,
*  I've done over 20 treatments now of hyperbarics. You get in the tank, um, you put on an oxygen
*  mask and they fill the tank up with oxygen and you lay there for an hour and a half to two hours.
*  Some people only takes an hour, but I'm bigger and they take me to a lower depth. And then my
*  ears kind of mess up on me a little bit on flights. Um, they kind of get clogged up or whatever
*  because of the hyperbaric chamber. No, it's just, they've always done that on planes. So it's like
*  you're in a plane when you're in the hyperbarics. And what it does is it pressurizes the oxygen
*  down into your cells. So it's literally going into your mitochondria. That's what the new studies
*  are showing. The oxygen gets in there and it promotes healing. And in your brain,
*  it literally brings blood flow into every part of the brain that needs it. So it's one of the
*  best things after a concussion. So I was with Raiden and what's I'm one of those guys that
*  sometimes thinks, um, everything happens for a reason, you know, or there's, there's not a lot
*  of coincidences. I had just started hyperbarics two or three days before I met Raiden. Then I'm
*  doing it and they're saying it's one of the best things for concussions. Raiden gets a concussion
*  from one of those fights. Um, or maybe it was one of the ones that wasn't on the fight, but they
*  diagnose him as with the doctors and his mom and his dad, whenever the doctor says, I think he
*  really has a concussion, did some testing on them, wrote a prescription and said, Hey, I really think
*  he needs to do hyperbarics. That's one of the best things for concussions. Now. And I was like,
*  I just started. And so literally that day, the doctor hands them a prescription for hyperbarics.
*  And then I take them in there and get hyperbarics. And this is probably the story I wanted to share
*  with you about hyperbarics the most there's this kid named Caleb Freeman, and he just made NBC
*  nightly news. Um, I think Fox news and ABC, um, he's making the news everywhere because of his
*  comeback story. The kid probably should have never been able to eat again on his own, especially
*  never be able to walk. His parents were told that he would be left in a vegetative state.
*  And if you have that Caleb Freeman video, because of one, he got in a vicious car accident,
*  16 years old. He had just started driving. He was the number one cross country runner at his school,
*  but also in his district. And then he got in this brutal car accident. Here's the video of him
*  trying to learn to put up the finger. Number one, again, there's a, he's trying to do a one
*  that's his dad kind of coaching them, but he was the number one cross country runner. Now he's
*  trying to get them to do a thumbs up. And this is off. Yep. Dramatic brain injury, driving down the
*  road, hit, hit a, uh, what's it hydroplained, gotten a brutal wreck. Um, and they thought he
*  would be left in a vegetative state for the rest of his life. So you can see right here, his muscles
*  are so atrophied because he had been in like, uh, I think he was in a coma or he was, um, in intensive
*  care for so long. Um, and so his dad's trying to get them to do a thumbs up. You know, he's, he's
*  trying his hardest to do that. You can go to the second video, um, and they're telling them, you
*  should really try hyperbarics. They try everything you can. And so the whole community has rallied
*  around them in Oklahoma. Um, he's from new castle where one of our board members are from,
*  and they're trying to help them learn to walk again, assisted. I don't know what they have him
*  break his arm. Yeah. He broke his arm. He fall down because in the other picture, it seemed like
*  it didn't have, um, actually don't know post accident. Yeah, this is post-accident. So maybe
*  this was before that other video. So which video are you trying to show them? Um, but trying to
*  show you both of these, because this is how far gone he was. And then after 40 hyperbaric treatments,
*  they say, get them in there. It'll flood his brain with oxygen. Right. When it has the oxygen,
*  it'll reproduce, uh, the blood flow and that'll bring actual healing into his brain. And so that
*  third video, um, is right here. He's literally, he was the number one cross country runner
*  at his school. So now he's trying to learn how to do cross country again. He wasn't ever
*  supposed to walk again on his own. He came in there to the hyperbarics assisted. Like you saw,
*  where people are assisting him on both sides, he does 40 treatments of hyperbarics. And then
*  all of a sudden he walks up and down the football field 14 times unassisted. Nothing changed. Um,
*  just 40 hyperbaric treatments. So like, you gotta keep doing this. Yeah. Yeah. That next video is
*  actually him. Oh, that's us at hyperbarics with Raiden. That's the young man that got the
*  concussion on the right in this video right here. I don't know if there's volume, but, uh, this is
*  actually a pretty special video. This is after 80 treatments. He's literally finishing his cross
*  country run again and he was never supposed to walk. And that's after like three or five miles.
*  Wow. And so, and how's his ability to communicate? Is that coming back as well?
*  He was actually texting me, uh, this morning. He texts me that picture of us and Raiden.
*  And his, his dad actually forgot. He goes, he was weird. Where do we take that picture again? And,
*  uh, where I don't have it saved. And Caleb goes, it's in your phone, dad, just look.
*  And so he's, he's able to recollect a lot of different stuff. That's amazing. So this is all
*  something that you're experiencing as well for your treatment for the parasites. Yep. And I've,
*  I've literally never gotten better sleep. I feel more positive when I come out of it. Um,
*  and then I feel like I can focus better because one of the things that they saw in my brain scans
*  were I have PTSD and then I have real, uh, severe ADD. Um, and they can see that on the f how my
*  brain functions. They guess there's like eight different types of brain. I think you need to do
*  it. I don't even want to know what's wrong with me. Dr. Amon's awesome, man. And so then I have
*  that. And then, so going into the oxygen, they can see from scan one to scan two, how my brain is
*  actually functioning better. And, uh, the spots with ADD have kind of cooled off a little bit.
*  Spots of PTSD have literally kind of gone down a little bit. Um, and so that was Caleb story.
*  There's also this girl named Eden Carlson and Eden Carlson. There's like a minute clip, um, on
*  the New York post and they did it on YouTube. This girl drowned for two hours. She was facing
*  float down in a pool or face down in a pool. Her mom pulled her out of maybe 15 minutes. She drowned
*  for two hours. She didn't breathe. She didn't have a heartbeat. Um, and then at the hospital,
*  they miraculously got her back. Her story's all over. If you just Google, even dead for two hours,
*  two hours, Eden Carlson, ED in Carlson. Um, she's the first one to, uh, have brain damage
*  reversal scientifically proven. They've done all the MRIs and CAT scans from the hyperbaric,
*  from hyperbarics. So one of the first things they need to do for normal victims. I mean,
*  I think this is worth trying to pull up one of those videos. Um, it's New York post Eden.
*  Okay. You can't pose the place that, but literally, um, there's an Eden Carlson video on YouTube.
*  And it's wild to see how she's recovered and how they told her she would never be able to eat again,
*  never be able to go to school, never be able to do that. Now she's basically a normal girl again.
*  Look at her there. Yeah. So cute right there. A little smile. That's amazing. Her mom is like
*  a huge advocate for it now. That's incredible. Now, but with you, what do they have to do? Like
*  they have to find out whether the parasites are still in your system, identify the parasites
*  because it could be an unknown parasite. Right. Well, they know it's schisto. And if I've had
*  schisto in me for as long as they think they don't think it started in April, they think maybe that
*  was another, not an onset, but took it to another level when I went there and got sick. Um, and it
*  was brutal. I mean, I was hugging basically the, the, uh, not the toilet, but the, um, uh, the
*  latrine, um, while I was in Uganda in April, uh, in May. Now, I mean, I was just so sick.
*  This hyperbaric is helping you, but you're still not able to train right now. Like you're not,
*  you're not like, you don't have a fight scheduled anytime. I don't have a fight scheduled, but I
*  would like to fight first quarter of next year. If I can't, is that literally possible? I mean,
*  if you're not six months from now, I have another follow-up appointment here, uh, in March,
*  and we're going to have a lot more data to show, like from my blood work to my
*  bacteria, my stomach, um, to, uh, those brain scans are going to be the big thing that show,
*  how my brain has started to heal, how my body started to feel, um, and show my health just
*  increasing. And so that's the goal. I'm on this mission to get, get healthy. Um, so I can
*  fight again, but also just so that can function better and have like not these big swings.
*  So the hyperbaric chamber is helping you, but yet you're still feeling some serious,
*  significant, I just started the hyperbarics a month ago. Okay. So I'm 20 treatments in, I need
*  to get, um, 40 done as soon as possible. Um, and then they think I'll probably do another round of
*  40. Um, and then, yeah, I, I mean, seeing how, how Caleb's doing, I mean, Caleb told Caleb showed
*  me this, this is wild. I come in and I'm, uh, about to get in the chamber with them and he shows me
*  his hands shaking and he's showing me, I don't know what that's called, but it's whenever, um,
*  uh, is that when Parkinson's and different stuff, like you have those kinds of shakes
*  or Alzheimer's or whatever that is. Um, so Caleb's got that and he gets in the chamber. 90 minutes
*  later, we get out, he shows me his hand and it's completely steel and he can put contacts back in
*  his eyes. Whoa. But before there's no way at all that he can get contacts in his eyes. Afterwards,
*  his body's calmed down enough. His brain has enough oxygen and blood flow in it that he can
*  put his contacts back in on that. So Raiden, um, his parents say that he was always up and down
*  in the middle of the night and that they'd have to try to put them back to sleep. Um, and now he
*  just, once he's asleep, he's asleep until they wake him up. Um, they think it's helping with his
*  autism, his diabetes, um, his AC one levels or whatever those are called, those have started to
*  come down. And what the doctors have told us is like, there's nothing better. The doctors take an
*  oath that say to do no harm. Like that's first and foremost is to do no harm. And like if someone
*  has a concussion or if someone has autism or if someone has, um, this bacteria or a parasite that
*  might be in the brain, why not flood the body on a cellular level? Oh, you're going to love this part
*  that can increase your, your STEM cells by eight times in your body. So it's one of the best
*  treatments for whenever you have the STEM cells injected in you. So I had the M S C's, the
*  mesenchymal STEM cells from my hip, put in my shoulder. They said one of the best things I
*  could have done for it would have been to get in a hyperbaric chamber because that would, um,
*  promote the STEM cell growth and life of the STEM cells because they're cells and you're pushing
*  oxygen into the cells and increasing blood flow into it. And you're extending their life and
*  helping them reproduce. So it's one of the best things out there, Joe. I, I wouldn't be talking
*  about it like this without, uh, Raphael is getting into it. Joe Namath, Joe Namath has his own, um,
*  clinic now for hyperbaric. Yeah. He's doing that through versus brain trauma for football. Right.
*  I read about that. Right. And it's the first time there's ever been documented cases of brain
*  trauma reversal, where if you can heal your brain, you can basically heal your life where you have a
*  healthy brain. You have a healthy life. We need a hyperbaric chamber in here. Can you buy portable
*  units? Yeah, absolutely. I use something called a secret, which I think you would really like. It's
*  the hard chamber. It's glass. You have one in your house. No, but the secret one or there's Joe Namath
*  doing it. I think Michael Phelps does it, you know, getting in the water. Wow. Literally it's wild at
*  how, how much stuff it actually. So what's the prognosis like with you with the doctors that have
*  looked for parasites or doing all this blood scan? They think that they're going to be able
*  to straighten you out. They think so. Yeah. I think they think with doing a holistic approach
*  where medication can come in, um, at a later date, I had this doctor that's, oh, you have PTSD.
*  Here's these pills. Oh, you have depression. Here's these pills. Yeah. Oh, okay. Now, now you're
*  starting to have anxiety for the first time in your life. You've never had it before. Here's some
*  more pills. Um, Oh, you think you have ADD here's some more pills. They put me on three or four
*  different pills at the same time. I started feeling like a zombie. Yeah. Uh, like a zombie.
*  I felt weird. I felt like I started having like electricity running through my veins or something
*  like, like, uh, my muscles started twitching. My eyelid was, uh, constantly spasming. So the
*  doctors that have looked at this, all the different various ailments that you have, like, and they
*  don't want you to do pills. So what, what do they want you to do and what do they think is going to
*  be able to happen? They think you'll be able to fight again. Are there, um, so Dr. Eamon, he's a
*  guy that says, man, our brains are the literally you can live, they can do lung transplants, right?
*  And heart transplants, kidney transplants, like you can't do a brain transplant. Right. Um, and so
*  he's saying that anyone that's in a brain damaging occupation, and he said, whether that's fighting
*  football or even being a firefighter, because that is a brain damaging occupation, you're breathing in
*  and burning couches, which are putting off all these harmful chemicals. Um, and so he said, you
*  want to protect it and promote your brain health as much as you possibly can. Right. Um, so he's a
*  brilliant guy and, um, he's going to be on weekly calls with me, guiding me, uh, keeping me
*  accountable on how am I protecting my sleep? How am I, what am I getting to eat? Uh, you know, also
*  supplementation of what's that one that you were on here with David Sinclair talking about?
*  NMN. Uh, it's like that. Roles. Resveratrol. Yes. Yeah. It's not drugs. Yeah. Okay. Well,
*  that plus some of the other things that you guys were talking about, like they're all in his, um,
*  supplements where he tells you, go get these supplements from here and here and make sure
*  that you're optimizing your brain health. So it seems like there's a bunch of different things
*  going on with the PTSD is PTSD has to do with things that you've seen in your childhood. But
*  then you've got the drug, the, the. Methyloquin toxicity of the brain or Cipro toxicity. Have
*  you heard of Cipro? What it does to you? No, what is Cipro is probably the number one antibiotic for,
*  um, intestinal bacterias. So if you get intestinal bacteria, they give you this, um, and what happens
*  with that? It kicks the bug out, whatever it is. Yeah. It's like the number one thing for
*  humanitarians that take with you overseas. But, but a huge, uh, huge, but huge side effect now is
*  cartilage ligaments and muscle tears. Oh, I have heard of that. I have heard of people taking extreme,
*  uh, antibiotics for staph infections. Yep. So Cipro is for staff and then afterwards. So you're
*  taking it because you got it wrestling. You take Cipro, you clear up and you go back into wrestling.
*  Now suddenly you tear your Achilles tendon. Yeah. And how long is it last? How long is it
*  weakened your ligaments? And it's at least for six months, they say, but it could be for a year or
*  longer. And so, uh, I took Cipro while I was in Congo for, for my gut health and for in Uganda,
*  while I tore my left, uh, labrum, I came back. Um, I got another round of sickness. I took Cipro.
*  I come back and I tear my right labrum, come back to tear my meniscus. And so they're like,
*  you probably definitely have probably Cipro and mephlaquine toxicity. Did you get operations on
*  your labrum or your meniscus? So you got your labrum surgically repaired, both of them. Uh,
*  no, just the left one, but I need the right one. I think. Yeah. And then I got my meniscus trimmed
*  up. Jesus. Man, it's been, it's been wild. You've been through the ringer. Yeah, it's been wild,
*  but it's all been worth it. Like this stuff that happened with, uh, Dustin Poirier, um, in Khabib
*  and then Dana matching it. I mean that, um, that blew us. Well, explain what you mean,
*  because people don't understand what you're saying. Yeah. Dustin donating money for fight for the
*  forgotten and Dana matching that money and Khabib as well. Yeah, that's what's nuts. So for that
*  fight, which was basically the modern day Rocky story, the undefeated Russian, they're building an
*  arena for them, uh, arguably never lost a round potentially. And, um, or at least a fight and, uh,
*  Dustin goes there, the underdog, and he started the good fight foundation, his own foundation
*  with his wife, Jolie. And they're awesome. I was actually on my first ever bow fishing, uh, trip,
*  and I get a call or a text, um, Instagram message from Jolie saying that Dustin, her one of help us
*  raise funds for this fight. So I get back to them. Then they call me and I literally have a bow,
*  uh, fishing like thing in my hand as my first time going, I didn't get anything. Um, but, uh,
*  anyways, they, they say they want to help us raise funds. I'm like, this is awesome. Uh,
*  they put up a fundraiser for $25,000 to help us drill a well for, um, an orphanage. So this
*  orphanage for the pygmies there, um, it's a school, but they've all lost their parents,
*  a lot of them because of, uh, HIV. Um, and, uh, their water source was taken out by a flood,
*  a torrential flood that happened there. Um, so in the eighties, they had built this kind of sort
*  of well, it's more of a called a spring box. It was like a mountain fed spring. Well, the mud
*  got all in it. It busted up the pipes from the eighties. There was no way to recover that thing.
*  So they needed a new one. Um, and so Dustin decided to set a goal to help us raise funds
*  for 25,000 to be able to put a big water tower with a big solar system that put piped water
*  into the classrooms, into, um, their living quarters, into the kitchen or the cafeteria.
*  And so, um, through the fight we had it funded. And then after that, the fun just kept coming in.
*  Dustin and Khabib exchange shirts and then Khabib said he was going to auction off his shirt and
*  give a hundred percent of it to Dustin. So that brought in a hundred thousand dollars.
*  Wow. Dana said he would match it. Dana matched it. Um, and so we're going to be able to drill
*  seven wells now, not just one with water tower, but seven wells. Uh, we're serving the other six
*  right now. We're getting close to finishing the first one. So has this, the parasites in this
*  disease, is this in any way weakened your desire to go back there? No, not, not weak in my desire
*  to go back there. Just, just, uh, influenced or encouraged me to, uh, to be a little smarter when
*  I'm there. What could you do differently? Just not go in the water? I could stay in nicer places
*  like the, um, doc team stayed in a hotel last time and you didn't, I actually did. Um, and that was
*  the first time I had ever done that. Um, normally I sleep in the twig and leaf huts and I sleep on
*  the dirt. Um, and if I'm rained on, I'm rained on and, um, and I don't use a mosquito net and
*  things like that. Um, just, I wanted to live like they lived and not have any of the real, um,
*  comforts and luxuries. And then them wonder why, why they don't have that or this or the other.
*  But yeah, now I'm going to take my own food. I'm not going to eat the food there that can be
*  contaminated. Um, uh, I'm going to make sure everything I eat, you know, I have clean hands
*  before I eat it. And I normally do that, but just double checking everything, Purell,
*  eat the food I bring, sleep in a hotel, um, and just go on day trips there. Um, and that'll
*  probably be smarter anyways, because if we bring someone with us, um, normally it's just me going.
*  But last time we brought Chris cyborg, um, and she, she helped with the kids. She helped drill
*  two wells there. So that was awesome. We're up to 16 wells now, um, in Uganda. Wow. Um, 61 total.
*  Uh, and we're about to get 30 acres of land with the money that came in from Dustin and Khabib.
*  Was she concerned at all about catching anything? Yeah, she got a little sick. Um, but I think it
*  was just from, uh, this chicken that we had, it was like chicken soup. I don't think they, um,
*  they maybe cook the chicken long enough. And so, uh, she, she got a little sick from that, but, um,
*  no, I think, I think going back is going to be okay. Um, and then doing strategic smaller trips.
*  What really messed up Chris was, uh, so in Uganda, the Pygmies lived in the Similiki national forest,
*  which was bordering Congo. Well, they were kicked out of the Kong or the rainforest by the Ugandan
*  wildlife authority to protect the forest. Now they're the protectors of the forest. Why do you
*  kick them out of the forest? They're not poachers. They only take what they need. Um, and they're,
*  they're hunter gatherers, but they, yeah, anyways, so they, they got rid of them in the forest,
*  put them behind a slum in this little town. And so they put them on one acre of land, over 300
*  people, over 300 people living on one acre of land. That's actually their land that they can call
*  theirs. So we're walking around and they did that six years before we get there. And, um,
*  the chief told us that there's now 35 families, only 151 people. And that, um, they're scared
*  that if it goes another six years, that they're all going to be gone, that their people group
*  won't exist anymore. Um, and so that was, um, chief or King Zito that told us that.
*  And so we're walking around and Chris, Chris kind of gets tripped up a little bit on this mound.
*  She looks down and she looks down and sees all these mounds around her. And she said,
*  what are these mounds? And the chief said, that's so-and-so. And this is so-and-so. And like says a
*  name and says a name is like, we live on our, on top of our graveyard. We don't have anywhere to
*  bury our dead. Jesus Christ. And so over 300 people on one acre of land. Now there's only 151
*  people. The rest of them are buried in the ground right there. Cause the slums throughout their
*  sewage and it goes right through their land. Oh my God. So we've got them back five acres of land
*  right now, but they're practicing how to farm on that. And then we're about to get 30 more acres
*  of land. And then they'll be able to live on the five acres and have these little plots of land for
*  households for a thousand, $2,000 each. We can build them a home and then they can start farming
*  at 30 acres and we'll want to expand that to 50 or a hundred to where they can have sustenance farming
*  to feed themselves. And then they'll be able to feed the community and sell that. And then be able
*  to send their kids to school with school uniforms and buying school fees or paying school fees and
*  stuff like that. Wow. Yeah. This makes you realize how easy we have it. This what makes you realize
*  how easy we have it. Oh man. Absolutely. And so that's why whenever you ask me, like, does this
*  make you not want to go back? I'm like, man, look at the challenges that they have each and every day.
*  Have you caught everything that you can catch over there? Dengue fever, malaria.
*  Yeah. What do you say this new things? Shisto, shisto, shisto. And this is a parasitic disease
*  as well. It's like a, I think it's in the fluke family or it's a, it's a worm. Yeah. And then
*  hopefully I don't have anything else besides that, but this toxicity stuff, Cipro or methlequin,
*  that could be messed with. You changed your diet as well. Yeah. Yeah. My wife, what are you eating
*  now? I eat mostly I eat meat, but I mostly vegetables like more of that, like the small
*  portion is meat. Um, and it'll be chicken or fish, um, or something lean, a lot of nuts and a lot of
*  thick, um, leafy green vegetables. And have you found that that's helped me a lot? It's helped me
*  a lot. Are you juicing at all? Yep. Yeah. I'm doing that. Uh, juicing with the, uh, with a Vitamix.
*  Okay. So you're getting all the fiber in there as well. Yeah. The fiber.
*  Wow. That's been really good. And then, and then I've been keeping myself busy. If I can't go there,
*  we're really starting to expand our mission and vision here, stateside, um, to bully prevention
*  because Joe, it's nuts right now. The second leading cause of death. Um, so Butch, um, is
*  Raiden's grandfather and he is an old bull rider. Um, and Raiden lives with, with Butch and Claudia's
*  grandparents right now. And they found them with in his forearm. He wrote, I want to kill myself
*  in Sharpie and he's 12. He's 12. Butch said the first time Raiden wanted to kill himself that he
*  knew of when it was, whenever Raiden was nine years old. So he's nine years old and already
*  suicidal. And Butch said, um, that that just makes his heart want to fall out of his chest.
*  You know, I'm his grandfather. How does my 12 year old grandson not have enough to live for?
*  And, um, the leading second leading cause of death among kids from 10 to 14 is suicide.
*  If you're between the ages of 10 to 14, that's the second reason. And bullying is the cause of
*  most of it's from bullying because bullying is linked to the, the increase in depression,
*  addiction, isolation. Do they think that the people who do it, is it because they were bullied
*  at one point in time or abused physically? So they do think that in the easy way to remember
*  that is hurt people, hurt people, right? Hurt people, hurt people, whether that's an addict
*  or a bully. Um, but, uh, here's a statistic from the CDC. It's funny. The CDC found out that I had
*  dengue fever. Um, and then also the CDC did the study on bullying and, uh, the number three, um,
*  at risk of suicide is the bully, the person that acts out by being a bully. Um, number two,
*  surprisingly is the victim. They're the second highest risk. So then you think who's, who's number
*  one. Well, number one is actually the one that does both. They are bullied and then they act out
*  by being a bully. And so they're getting it on both ends. No positive feelings at all. It's just
*  all a storm of negativity. Yeah. Awfulness. It's this huge. What can you do for, for bully
*  awareness? Right? Like how can you, how can you prevent it or how can we mitigate it?
*  Yeah. I think it's by promoting a culture of cultivating a culture of kindness. And I know
*  that can sound a little wimpy. No, I don't think so at all. Yeah. But if you look at Raphael, uh,
*  Lovato Jr, he was bullied, um, because he didn't look like everybody else. George St. Pierre,
*  so many, a lot of fighters are bullied. Most, most fighters I find were bullied not being the bully.
*  Um, and so I think to cultivate a culture of kindness, there's actually the school in Oklahoma.
*  It's pretty awesome. They're called Edmond Santa Fe. They selected us between a 44 applicants.
*  So we were up against like boys and girls club and make a wish. These phenomenal organizations,
*  uh, uh, special Olympics and some really, really great, um, charities and nonprofits out there.
*  Last year, the school selected a foster home and they raised in a week.
*  This high school rates $234,000, a high school and their philanthropy week,
*  because they wanted to help these kids get a new, um, like main center, uh, among the foster homes.
*  So this year they selected us because they want to get our bully prevention program
*  into public and private schools. What is the prevention program? Like what? Yeah.
*  So it's mostly character development with bully prevention inside of it. So it's a 12 week program
*  and it's 12 weekly lessons. So we have it online. It's digital. It's on our website,
*  fight for the forgotten.org. And if you click heroes and waiting, you'll find it. That's our
*  curriculum. What's called as heroes in waiting. And what that is, is there's a digital curriculum
*  where I teach the teacher or instruct the instructor how to instruct the lesson that week.
*  But then there's a video for the parents and for the students. Um, that's the weekly hero challenge.
*  And so they get a weekly lesson or mat chat discussion, and then they get a weekly challenge,
*  which the challenge will be something like recognized when you're being a bystander
*  or my favorite is probably go out. Your mission this week is that your hero challenge is to go out
*  and complete a secret random act of kindness. So the rules are, you have to be safe. You have to
*  be smart, but you have to be completely anonymous and you have to go out and make someone feel great.
*  And so journal or report back to us, you know, what did you do? How'd that make them feel? How
*  that make you feel? How can you build onto this for next week? Um, and you go out and you complete
*  these missions because I think first you have to educate the kids that they are part of the solution
*  and part of the problem. They just have to pick where they, where they're going to be because,
*  um, in bullying, if you stand by and you watch, if you laugh, giggle, like in that video, there's 12,
*  12 kids in the bathroom, four or five are filming it. You filming it is encouraging it.
*  You standing by and not doing anything. You're actually not an innocent bystander. You're a
*  silent supporter because you're standing there and you're not doing anything. They're actually
*  trying to pass laws about kids in schools, filming other kids, getting beat up and making them
*  somehow like part of it, an accomplice, some way, shape or form. Cause you are,
*  you're at least an encourager. And then if you stand by and watch, you are an accomplice. You're
*  not doing anything. You didn't choose it. It shows you what happened to those kids in the video that
*  were doing those things to raid and they're beat. So they're minors. So I can't really talk about
*  what's happened, but, um, the school has taken appropriate or at least in their eyes, appropriate
*  and swift action. Um, the parents are thankful to the school and the school district for them
*  taking this, um, serious. Uh, I know that the family has felt this has been going on since he
*  was nine at least. Um, and now he's 12. So three years and they say the only reason now something's
*  being done is cause it was filmed because it's on video and it went viral. Um, but there's been some
*  fun stuff. We can pull up some of those rating pictures. There's another one recently with Dylan
*  Dennis, Dylan Dennis got jujitsu lessons. He paid for jujitsu lessons for this young boy.
*  He was also beat up in the bathroom and there's a film of that as well. You know what I'm talking
*  about? Yeah. And Dylan, uh, posted this video too, and he got over 10 million views, um, which was
*  awesome. And Raphael now is actually going to scholarship Raiden and his brother Brock with
*  jujitsu lessons. Oh, that's amazing. So they're going to start doing martial arts training after
*  Raiden's done with his hyperbarics and his concussion has settled down. He's going to come
*  into the mats and be part of the kids program, the little warriors for, uh, for Raphael school,
*  which are the best youth program in the state. That's awesome. Yeah. That's awesome. Is there a
*  way to pull up some of those pictures of, of Raiden? Um, and this is kind of cool. I'm going to
*  give you this because, uh, Raphael really likes this and it's some 10th planet guys. Um, there's
*  Raiden after, uh, after a, uh, uh, actually a press conference, all the news wanted to like post
*  pictures of them, um, or they wanted to get exclusives. And so his parents are being chased
*  all around town. People are literally posting their home address online, doxing them, but doxing the
*  bullies mainly saying, here's the 12 year old girl's address and go, go find her. Um, if you
*  can go through a couple more of those pictures, uh, there's some pretty cool ones where, um,
*  eating Chick-fil-A. Yeah. He likes Chick-fil-A a lot. His dad says he's a chicken eating fool.
*  Um, but there's at a football game that Edmund Santa Fe, they've, uh, surrounded him with a lot
*  of love. And then it's been cool. Like, um, Emily, my wife has said, oh, here, here's, if we can have
*  volume on this, this is pretty cool. I am introducing Raiden to what? He asked me what hummus is. So we
*  got him some, some carrots and hummus. The chips are for me that you packed us. And all right,
*  my man, dry carrots and hummus. That's really good. Really good. Yeah.
*  So what's the book? Um, yeah. So this right here is, uh, the jujitsu planner and what it does is
*  you have actually a, um, like a training autopsy and you, you take notes, what your lessons or
*  what you're learning, the techniques you're learning. Um, and this is out of 10th planet,
*  or at least the guys that, that created this, uh, Ben is a 10th planet Austin guy,
*  a guy named Zach Moore that's there too. Um, so he's available online. It's only once I buy one
*  of these. It's available online, where they get Instagram, it's jujitsu planner. Where's the
*  website? I think it's jujitsu planner.com or jujitsu planner.org. And so, and they give 10%
*  to fight for the forgotten. That's pretty cool. So, um, yeah, 10% of the proceeds go to us, but
*  try to optimize your game. It's a, got a training schedule, shows you when you're training. So you
*  get to mark down. So you're essentially, you're held accountable for your lessons. Yeah. What
*  is this? Is an injury report, pay attention to your body. Interesting. You have supplements you
*  can put down there, like showing you like what's hurt. What's going on. Um, and then you have a
*  competition tracker. So you can, uh, record your opponents, how it went. Um, and you can also
*  at a tournament, like start scouting out your competition. Um, and then they're going to have
*  it to where they, they, uh, make new additions and things like that. And so as it grows and as it
*  scales, um, every planner they have for now on 10% is going to go to fight for the forgotten.
*  This is very interesting, man. Training autopsy. Yeah. I like it. Yeah. I thought you'd dig it.
*  Session notes, what was drilled strengths, weaknesses, roll notes, and then for next class.
*  I like this. This is, that's the man writing things down, you know, anything you can do where
*  you're focusing on something and trying to improve. If you can write it down, it's better. Was this
*  inspired by the, the kind of book that you have? Would you exactly what was called again? Uh, this
*  one's called clear. It's just a habit tracker. And then you have like a journal in it too. Um,
*  and I really liked that. And I like how I also have another one called the full focus planner
*  in that you can plan out your day, your week, um, and you break it down and I can train track my
*  food, my training, um, all my important meetings. Um, and for me, writing it down physically is
*  better than having it digitally. Yeah. Um, I just remember it better. Me too. Um, if I, if I haven't
*  written it down, I'll probably forget it. I keep notes like comedy notes. I keep them on my phone,
*  but then when I go to do a show, I always write it out. Always. That's really smart. They say
*  the writing things. There's something about physically putting a pen to paper that like
*  really commits it to memory better than anything else. Yeah. So that's why I have those two,
*  actually three of another one called the five minute planner. I take three journals around with
*  really, so I do the habit tracker, the full focus planner for my daily and weekly schedule. Um,
*  the habit tracker that I can also just take, take other notes. And then the five minute planner or
*  five minute journal, you start off with, um, what three things, what would make today great three
*  things. Um, and then three things actually start with three things you're grateful for. So you
*  write that down, then three things that would make today amazing, then a daily affirmation.
*  And then at the end of the day, what three great things did happen today. And then the very last
*  one is, uh, how could you make today better? And so kind of this reflection of I could have done this
*  better today. So that way you're kind of keeping yourself accountable on that end. I also have
*  something else for you, my man. I can come bearing gifts. We'll get this thing. What the
*  fuck is that dude? This is called a bushwhacker. I think, um, something they use in the Congo.
*  No, no, we'll get there. What in the fuck, bro? So that is like a machete. Be careful because that
*  thing is really sharp. The weight behind it. I don't want you to cut yourself. Okay. Yeah.
*  It's like a giant wood handle. Like you could double fist a sucker. Yeah. Uh, Mike Jones knife
*  and tool. You actually have one of his knives. Yeah, I do. Um, and he made this because he is
*  now giving 5% of all of his knife sales to fight for the forgotten. And he was turned on to us
*  through the show. This one's another one that he made my friend, Mike Hawkerage came in on these.
*  Yeah, that's, uh, that's what he said. Oh, wow. It's got a built in little sharpener.
*  Yep. That's, that's a knife or a fire starter. It is. Yeah. Oh, that's a fire stick and it's a
*  a moose. Um, you use that tie over the top. Oh, it's a bungee. Okay. Now the knife itself,
*  super sharp. It's Damascus steel. It's pretty. And then, um, that's his bow hunter style knife.
*  The wood is Koa wood from Hawaii. So we thought you'd like that. And then he always has his little
*  signature smile. Yeah. I follow him on the Instagram. Yeah. He's a great guy. Yeah. The
*  other knife that Mike had made for me is a bow hunter as well. This is beautiful, man. Thank you.
*  Thanks Mike too. That's pretty, man. And there's one more there from Mike Jones himself. So he,
*  he, he did a thing called knife for the forgotten and, uh, he sold a hundred percent of his knives
*  for fight for the forgotten. And so that one's a chef's knife that he thought you'd really like.
*  Oh, that's pretty. The wooden handle is actually black wood from Africa. So it's probably from
*  Tanzania. Um, but it's a chef's knife and he's got that smiley face in there, but it took him like
*  15. I knew how much you appreciate like craftsman work. So that took him 15 to 18 hours to make
*  that. That's pretty, it's a small handle too. It's interesting. Wow. That's beautiful. Thanks,
*  man. Yeah, man. I thought you'd like it. I'm, I'm not worthy. Well, and then that was just to set
*  up this one because this knife is what it was actually all about. But Mike said, Oh, let me,
*  let me throw in a knife or two. Um, cause he, he literally gives 5% of all his knives. Is this one
*  of the ones that was made by the Pygmies that was made by King Zito himself? Um, it was some scrap
*  metal. It's not the sharpest knife. Um, and he said it wasn't the best for me to give to you,
*  but I thought it was the most unique. That's his, that's his actual kind of signature, um,
*  design that he puts in there. It's so light. Yeah. It's crazy. What is this wood?
*  So it's a wood that's out of the Simileke national forest and, um, they they've been collecting it
*  for generations. I wish people could feel this, how light this is. It feels like styrofoam. It's crazy.
*  So they have these different kinds of like almost cork feeling knives, um, or handles.
*  Please tell him I said, thank you. I will. That's very nice of him. N Z I T O. Wow. That's so pretty.
*  So yeah, that's cool, man. I was able to get you one of those and then, uh, dust and pori one as
*  well. That's dope. Beautiful. Yeah. So what's the plans now? Like you're, you're going, you're trying
*  to get your health back together. And when are you planning on going back to the Congo again?
*  So I'm definitely going to Uganda, um, sometime soon. Uh, hopefully, well, if I could fight first
*  quarter of next year, how is that possible? I don't know. I'm being optimistic. Don't rush it.
*  I'm not going to rush it, but it's been over two years. Shoulder surgery. Yeah. That takes six
*  months anyway. Yeah. So how are you going to do that? That's first quarter. Yeah. Forever.
*  Cause we're, we're almost in November. So November in two days. It's true. So December,
*  January. Okay. Now we're into the first quarter of the next year. They said structurally,
*  I could fight with this structurally. I hate that word. Please. No, man. Come on, man. I, I need to,
*  I need to go slow. Yeah. Please don't, um, don't fight for a while, please. Yeah. You kind of get
*  everything. You gotta get in order, man. And that's what I've been telling people. And people are,
*  there's people are really excited for me to fight, but then also I know I can hold with these people.
*  I'm just need fans. Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, hopefully they'll hear this and they love you. And they'll
*  like Justin, please don't not right now. Yeah. Get yourself a hundred percent back. Right.
*  So I guess what we're doing is actually there's two really exciting things for now you said. So
*  what now? Um, we're doing two things back to back are actually simultaneously. Um, for fight for the
*  forgotten, we have an end of the year fundraising competition. And so last year we did it and we had
*  a, we invited about a hundred martial arts academies to raise funds on our behalf.
*  And in eight weeks we raised $135,000. That's amazing. It was incredible. That's amazing.
*  So now we're calling this our second annual fundraising competition. Last year, the academy
*  that won the top fundraiser is he was James Wright out of martial arts and more in North Carolina.
*  Their academy had just been hit by a hurricane. And so since it was hit by hurricane, the mats
*  were ruined and the, the equipment, all their pads and, uh, mitts and bags were all molded.
*  So they had to get rid of everything. Well, they wrote, they won the fundraising tournament
*  and, uh, they got a better than new gym. It was over a $20,000 gym renovation that century
*  martial arts did and also zebra athletics. That's cool. So, um, literally they got a better than new
*  academy. That's very cool. That's very cool. And it was cause they were fundraising on our
*  behalf this year. We've got a top 10 instead of the top one, uh, fundraiser gets a, gets a prize.
*  Now the top 10 get a martial arts draft pick. So martial arts superstars, um, world champions,
*  whether it's former current UFC or Bellator champions, hall of famers, martial arts coaches
*  of the year that will fly out to their academy to do a seminar or a training day or a fan
*  experience, um, for fundraising on our behalf. That's fucking awesome. So we have, well, that's
*  so cool of zebra and so cool of century. Yeah. Century has been around forever, man. Yeah.
*  They made the kicking jeans. Yes. I used to have those that lace up in the front, like a pair of
*  still make those, do they? Yeah. I used to wear the Taekwondo version of that for tournaments.
*  I used to wear the ones that laced up in the front. I liked those because they made like kick
*  boxing pants. Make me remember when they used to have kickboxing used to be above the waist,
*  like PK karate style centuries to make those pads for karate tournaments. And I still think they have
*  the best bag. They have the sweet spot in the Muay Thai bag. Like I have, I bought like four
*  different kinds of Muay Thai bags for this gym here. And the century one that I have at home is
*  the best one. I have 150 pound, the big Muay Thai bag. It's the best one. It's the sweet spot
*  between not too soft, not too hard. Just, just perfect. Well, they're the only ones that actually
*  make those here. Bill super foot. I was just with him. Kicking jeans. How is he doing? He's doing
*  good. He was aged from that, but I believe he has. Yeah. He was the first commentator for the UFC.
*  Really? Yeah. Is that Chuck down at the bottom? There's Chuck. Yeah. Yeah. I got to meet him this
*  summer too. I got to meet him a couple of times. I still love meeting him. I still get a boyish
*  thrill out of just the fact that he knows who I am. I'm like, I can't believe it.
*  Won't bind your legs. Like that. But Chuck and Bill super foot Wallace, I mean, those guys were
*  the real innovators back in the early days of kickboxing in America. You know, when those guys,
*  if you go back and watch some of those tournaments that those guys fought in, Chuck Norris was a
*  legitimate world champion. Yeah. And I never really knew Dallas Fort Worth had such a big
*  martial arts. Oh yeah. Huge martial arts background. Chuck there. And then,
*  you know, Bill Wallace's story, he had a fucked up knee and so he couldn't kick with both legs.
*  You can only kick with one leg. I didn't know that. Yeah. So he developed this insane left leg. Super
*  foot. Yeah. So he had a hook kick, like a hook kick is a kick that it's very rare that someone
*  develops that to the point where, you know, you can knock people out with it. It's just a weird
*  kick and you don't really see it very often in MMA. It's just, I mean, I think Sean Jordan
*  dropped a Derek Lewis. That's right. The hook kick and black bees crazy because Sean is a tank
*  of a man. I mean, he's, he's a small, heavy or short, short five, 10, but he's at least two
*  six. Oh yeah. He's a big fella. He's in the range of two 60. So to see him live those tree trunk
*  leg. I know for, for LSU. Yes. And the guy could do fucking backflips. He's a crazy athlete,
*  but to see him throw a hit, a hook kick, you're like, what? Yeah, absolutely. You know,
*  but it's such a rare technique. Connor throws it. He throws it occasionally. He does, but a bill
*  super foot Wallace, he figured out how to fuck people up with just one leg. And it was really
*  hard to deal with like that style of attack that he developed in his early days. I got to see him
*  fight live once way, way, way back in the day. Yeah, there it is. Here it is. Yes.
*  That's crazy. Crazy that he hit, he dropped him with a hook kick to the,
*  I think the picture of it is where is Sean these days? He was fighting for the PFL was, um,
*  but I think, I don't know if he's in this tournament or not. I know he was in the last
*  tournament. So him and Josh, big Josh fought. Um, I think yeah, yeah, decision. And, uh,
*  so yeah, I guess for now though, we're doing that tournament, that competition in last year,
*  the last four or five kind of top gyms or schools competed for all the way until midnight of new
*  year's Eve central time. Cause that's when the cutoff was and the winner was going to get their
*  gym renovated. So there's four or five at the end and we raised like 30 grand on the last day
*  because everyone wanted the gym renovation. So this year we've got a top three prize pack.
*  That's like that. The first one gets like a $25,000 gym renovation from zebra and century. Um,
*  they get featured in black belt magazine. They get featured in March, it may success. I think
*  Bruce buffer is going to announce him as the winner. They're going to get a trophy and a medal.
*  They're going to championship belt for the champion. And then they get the first round
*  draft pick of guys like, uh, Rashad Evans, Justin Gagey, Chris cyborg, Rose Nami, Eunice, Pat Berry,
*  um, uh, Rafi Lovato jr, uh, Sean G, uh, laborio. Uh, these people are going to fly out. Frank
*  Meir are going to fly out and do a seminar at their, their academy or pick whoever it is.
*  So whoever is one through 10, you want to get number one or number two, cause you get the top
*  draft pick. What's the top draft pick? Who's the top one? Well, whoever raises the most is the first,
*  they get the, they claim the first draft pick and then they get to choose between that list of like
*  20 martial arts superstars. That's what is Dustin Poirier coming out to your, to your gym or is it
*  Chris cyborg or is it Justin Gagey or Rashad Evans? So when you secure the first place, you get the
*  first round draft pick and then all the way down to 10. Um, and then on the individual side, they're
*  going to get it. There we go. Yeah, it's on our website. So it's fight for the forgotten.org slash
*  heroes. Um, and we're even missing a few of the people that are man Richie boogie. There you go,
*  Richie. Yeah. I thought he would like that jujitsu planner. Um, but he's going to be in it with
*  Alima lay. Um, we're missing page van Zanten, Austin Vandervoort. That's awesome. Um, oh, even,
*  uh, even a John Hacklman. Oh, really? When his name go out and train someone and put on a bully
*  proof seminar. Yeah. Uh, he's got a great Instagram page. Yeah, he does. He's such a great podcast.
*  He's such a fucking character, man. I just drove down the, uh, what do you call it? The PHC post
*  Pacific coast highway. Oh yeah. PCH. Um, and, uh, stopped into the pit and saw him in, uh, slow or
*  Sam, Sam, Louisa, BISPA. Yeah, that's awesome. That's a cool little town. And that is, yeah,
*  very nice. He loves it out there. Yeah. His wife's sweet and they have a great academy there. Yeah.
*  He's, he's old school, hardcore training methods. He does like wheel barrels filled with shit. You
*  got to carry up a hill and stuff. All that kind of stuff. Yeah. I walked into the boot camp area
*  and it's where his wife runs the women's boot camp. He's like, no, no, you don't want to be in
*  here. This is like, uh, this is the torture room or something like that. This is a dungeon. You
*  don't want to be in here. How about the pit itself is an outdoor gym and outdoor octagon they have
*  set up. Man, pretty bad ass. It was wild. Um, he's upstairs. He has a podcast studio. Does he? Yeah.
*  He's doing a podcast. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Everybody's doing a podcast. Who's not?
*  I'm not yet. You're not? No. Weird. Why I should.
*  That's what my buddy, uh, Jacob Wells wants to do is start a podcast. Maybe not fight for the
*  forgotten podcast. It's a great idea. I mean, it's another way to raise awareness. That would be cool.
*  Yeah. Jacob is actually buddies with, he's a, he's a hilarious guy. Um, he's friends with Theo Vaughn.
*  He wrote a few jokes for Theo and Theo said that they're too dark. Uh, he couldn't, he couldn't
*  share them. Um, but him and Theo, uh, when Theo came to okay, see Jacob and us hung out and, uh,
*  anyways, Jacob has started this go fund me for Raiden because he knows their family and Raiden
*  has like $8,000 in medical bills, um, is going to need counseling. So three to $5,000 of like
*  a counseling budget. Um, and then, uh, they want to do something practical for the family.
*  And I've gone to 20 hyperbaric treatments with Raiden. Now we've had family dinners at my house,
*  at their house, um, at our offices, uh, his grandma can cook. She can cook some meatloaf. Um,
*  and she had me over there and they live in this mobile home park, um, outside Oklahoma city
*  and the boys. So the dad, um, he had worked in automotive industry and then at a dealership.
*  And then he came and kind of took over the family restaurant. Well, it started to struggle. The
*  family restaurant did. Um, and anyways, his dad now has two jobs is trying to make ends meet.
*  His mom can't really work because she has to take him to appointments, whether it's counseling or
*  for his hearing aid or for his diabetes or for his autism. She's taken with all these different
*  appointments. And so they had to take in Scotland's mom because of health issues. So the parents now
*  have the, one of the grandparents live in there. So they're in the bedrooms. They had to send Raiden
*  and his brother Brock to live with the other grandparents down the street. So still the same
*  mobile home park, but they put them in like the three bedroom, kind of nicer one, uh, with more
*  space. And so Jacob's like, what would really help this family and bless them in a way? Cause
*  his dad doesn't want to hand out. He's not asking for extra stuff or he didn't come up with this
*  idea, but Jacob's like, what if we could reunite the family? So get his hyperbaric treatment covered,
*  get his counseling covered. But then what if we could even raise funds for a,
*  either a single wide three bedroom, two bath, or maybe it's a double wide that just reunites
*  the family that gets Brock and Raiden back in the home, uh, with his parents. And so Jacob brought
*  that idea up. We shared it with his parents. Um, they started balling, just saying that that's
*  their greatest need is just to have the boys back in the home. And so there's this car dealership
*  in Oklahoma city called Huda Berg and they're really community minded. They give to fight for
*  the forgotten and they give to a lot of organizations. And so they have a campaign
*  called Huda Berg helps. And, uh, so Huda Berg helps as sponsoring this. I think they've already
*  raised like $8,000, $9,000. It's called stand with Raiden on go fund me. So it's go fund me,
*  hashtag stand with Raiden. And I think it's already at eight, nine, $10,000 of like the
*  $50,000 goal. Um, so that's something that we're focused on now. My wife was like, Hey, why are you
*  fight for the forgotten? Couldn't send funds to one kid individually. That's showing biased. And
*  we have to have like a, and, uh, uh, a pool of people to choose from applicants. Then it has to
*  be unbiased for us to fund something so I can rally around them. I can be his friend, but we can't pay
*  for his medical treatment or pay for his counseling, but go fund me can. And so Jacob started this,
*  it was his idea and he just wanted to rally around Raiden. And my wife asked me, why, why are you
*  doing all this? Even though the funds can't be raised for fight for the forgotten? It's like,
*  well, you know, I don't know. I just, I really connect with Raiden and she goes, I know why
*  you're doing this. You're just trying to be the guy that you needed whenever you were his age.
*  Um, and that, that really, uh, I don't know that that one kind of hit home. Um, because when I was
*  12 or 13 years old and was suicidal, um, being bullied, um, it would have been cool to have
*  someone rally around me a few years later at coaches that rallied around me, that made me
*  believe in myself. Um, but it's been awesome man, seeing Raphael come alongside Raiden and his family
*  scholarship them. Uh, the, the Steelers Pittsburgh Steelers, the, uh, LA chargers, um, uh,
*  that Baker Mayfield, all these people posting videos and support for them. Mick Foley is their
*  favorite wrestler, uh, WWE, uh, mankind or, uh, uh, anyways, he made a video for Raiden and his
*  mom and dad literally cried because, uh, that was their favorite wrestler. And he knows exactly
*  what they're going through because they're his son mix. Mick Foley son has autism. And so to see
*  that support go out to Raiden, like that just blew him away. That's very cool of you, man.
*  I don't know what is in store for you in the next life, but I, I sense some sort of sainthood.
*  I don't know about that. I just, uh, your whole life is dedicated to helping people.
*  It's very humbling, man. It really is. I mean, everything you do is helping other people,
*  your goals and your desires, even for you fighting with people. Maybe they don't know.
*  Some people don't know you got back into fighting so that you could raise awareness for fight for
*  forgotten and, you know, became a world-class heavyweight. You really became a better version
*  of yourself than you were when you were fighting in the UFC. Yeah. You know, and then I think also
*  through Rafael Lovato training with him, your jujitsu skills came up big time. Yeah. Big time.
*  Yeah. And I think this is what I've learned through Rafael, uh, and through a guy out here
*  named Ed Milette that's become a friend. These guys say it's usually it's either Rafael or Ed
*  that says it's usually the person with the most reasons that usually wins or the person with the
*  most reasons usually wins unless you're fighting Anderson Silva in his prime. That's true. That's
*  true. He must've had a lot of reasons. So good. There's certain people, man, it doesn't matter
*  what you believe. They're going to fuck you up. Yeah. You know, but, but, but knowing your why,
*  and for me, it was, um, for you, it's like how to be, I love that, that quote you have, uh, in our,
*  our programs called heroes in waiting, right? Will you say, be the hero of your own movie?
*  Well, be your own hero of your own movie. And after you become that hero, be a hero for someone
*  else and let them know they can be the hero of their own movie. Yeah. Um, and so our premise is
*  what is a hero? It's not someone with supernatural strength or superhuman power. It's actually
*  someone with a humble heart that just sees a need and takes action. They don't need Instagram
*  likes. They don't need, uh, the exposure, um, what they do it because it's the right thing to do.
*  Yeah. Um, and so how can we just see a need and take action, make a difference,
*  be the change we want to see in the world. Where do you see yourself in like 10, 15 years? Do you,
*  do you see yourself pursuing this exact same thing, you know, past the point where you're
*  fighting anymore? Do you see yourself just continuing with fight for the forgotten?
*  You think that that's probably going to be your future? That's fight for the forgotten is, um,
*  well, so we became an official five, one C three, uh, charity, um, last August. So it was more of a
*  passion project before that. Now we're official, uh, five, one C three of, as of August we've had
*  since that time, more than 3000 donors from all 50 states. It's very cool with a square spaces,
*  excuse me, square. And the cash app is doing without a doubt. That's amazing. 58 different
*  countries have donated. Wow. 58 different countries, Joe. I mean, that's the quarter of
*  the ball. You're raising awareness. I mean, that's that you share in the platform with me so that I
*  can get the word out there. I mean, I want to fight for the free on to outlive me. This isn't just
*  passion project of, of Justin Wren. I want it to be a, how many people are involved in it now?
*  Man, on the organizational side, we have, uh, five voting board members. We have seven and we
*  might take that up to nine. Um, and we should tell people that we're going to be doing a charity
*  event in Los Angeles. We're just trying to get a venue. We were trying to move it now to the first
*  quarter of 2020, but we're going to do a charity show, uh, at one of the big theaters in LA. Yeah.
*  That's going to be incredible. Yeah. That's going to be so fun. We get together all my funny friends.
*  Have some fun. Oh, I know a lot of people that want to go. I just got to record with Mike Tyson,
*  uh, yesterday and he told me, tell you what's up. I'm going to do a show soon.
*  Do it. I'm so scared. I couldn't do it during this month. Cause uh, it's so brock toe. Oh yeah.
*  You don't do it during this month. Um, funny that Mike Tyson has become this crazy weed activist.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And, and his resort that he was telling me about his head. It's amazing land with weed.
*  What are they going to do? They're doing concerts there and shit. You can stay there. Yeah. Well,
*  so what he's going to do and uh, hopefully this isn't, um, I'm not committing them to it,
*  but they kind of said, we're going to do this for this fundraising tournament that we're doing
*  right now, the competition. Um, they're going to give away and we'll, we'll have to update people
*  later, but for 15, 20, $25,000, someone donating, they're going to get like an exclusive VIP
*  experience at Tyson ranch. The resort you get to hang with Mike Tyson and you get to get a picture
*  and tour the studio and hot box. And I think you get to sit in on an episode or something.
*  Yeah. Wow. Something like that. And it's going to be a higher ticket item. So that way they're like,
*  it's not just some crazy person. Um, that's very cool, but uh, they're doing that. Um, I was
*  thinking there might be a way, uh, we can talk about this more afterwards, but we'd maybe give
*  a fan experience to someone at the comedy show. Um, we could give like a VIP front row tickets
*  or something like that. Um, if someone donates to help kickstart our fundraising competition,
*  because what we're doing right now, last year raised 135, 137,000. This year we're shooting
*  for 200 to 250,000. And then we want it every year to become kind of the premier fundraising event
*  of the martial arts world, the combat sports world, where everyone knows about this charity event.
*  And then you can win once in a lifetime experiences with martial arts superstars
*  or personalities, things like that to where we could build it into a sustainable. This is going
*  to bring in seven figures a year, a million dollars a year. And then that way we know our budget,
*  how many wells we can drill, how much land we can get, how many farms we can start,
*  how many kids here we can help with the martial arts curriculum. It takes us close to $500 to get
*  into the martial arts academies with the bully prevention curriculum.
*  Now, as this expands, as fight for the forgotten expands and you do more and more work in the Congo,
*  do you anticipate moving to other parts of the world? Yeah. So we already in Uganda, right?
*  We started that last year, but we really, um, kickstarted it April with this big kind of
*  celebration on new land, five acres because of Dustin's donation. We're going to take that up
*  to 30 more acres. So 35 acres in Uganda. We want to get that to a hundred. We want to get it to
*  even more than that. There's a potential that with fight for the forgotten, we could potentially
*  start up a social enterprise or what are those called B corps or something like that, where
*  it's a social entrepreneurship gig, where we start up maybe a coffee farm, maybe a honey farm
*  in these mountainous regions. And the Pygmies can have a sustainable job.
*  They love coffee and honey. Those are two things that they love coffee and coffee and honey.
*  It's funny. Um, there's this, uh, but John G as a Pygmy man, grandfather and elder in Mabukulu
*  village, but John G he's actually in the, in the book, uh, picture with my wife leaning over
*  and she's squatting down and she's still as tall as he is. Um, and she's in a full squat and she,
*  so he's a really little guy. Um, but this one time I saw him, his grandkids had just raided
*  a honey hive or a beehive. Um, and they just had honey all over their hands, their arms, their faces,
*  how they keep from getting stung. No, they get stung. They get stung like crazy. Yeah. They
*  start a fire at the bottom and then they throw a vine around it. And then they just walk up it
*  with your feet and you're holding onto the vines. Jesus. And it's crazy. You take a, an axe up there
*  and then you just start hacking into the tree with Africanized colonies, which are killer bees,
*  which is nuts. So they're getting stung like killer killer bees or gangster. They're, they're,
*  they're crazy. How many stealing honey from killer bees and no one else, everyone else is freaked
*  out by it. How many stings do they get hundreds? Oh, hundreds, but it's worth it to them. So they
*  start that fire underneath and the smoke goes up. So that helps keep them off. Then if two people
*  climb up it, the sole person's job on the back is to have these leaves from a twig and they just are
*  hitting the bees off of the guy raiding the hive. Do you remember when everybody was worried that
*  Africanized killer bees were going to come over here and kill us all? Yes. That was like a big
*  fear like 20 years ago. Oh, the killer bees, they've been spotted in New Mexico. They came up from,
*  but then they breed it right in, in, in with our busy bees, right. I think they say that we don't
*  have to worry about those. I'll be, when they went down to the Amazon and came up here,
*  those would be dangerous. Yeah. So these guys, they, they do this, they, and do they, they catch it in
*  a bag or something? Like how do they, they put it in a basket, a basket, a basket of hand. Oh, here
*  it is in India. This is some guys doing it pretty much the same exact thing. Those are the killer
*  bees. Yeah, those are different bees. But it's the same strategy. Same strategy. Have you,
*  Oh my God, look at that. He said he could reach in and grab bees. This guy's an asshole. What are
*  you doing, man? Have you guys seen that? Um, there's a certain type of honey that has some
*  sort of psychedelic effect and it's a, a very popular honey. I want to say Nepal somewhere.
*  Is it Nepal? Yeah. And these guys, they climb up to get this shit. It's like on the side of cliffs.
*  Like, see, do we have anything else? And, uh, yeah, see these guys use these ropes to climb up to get
*  that rope looks sketchy as fuck. That looks like some homemade shit right there. And so they, um,
*  this honey hunting work is very, I mean, it's the craziest thing I've seen people do, but these guys,
*  this, uh, honey, 200 feet in the air, man, is a different kind of honey. For some reason, this
*  honey makes you trip balls. Of course it's a vice documentary, the Nepalese honey that makes people
*  hallucinate. So they add something into it. No, no, no, no, no. It has to do with whatever these
*  plants, these guys are getting the power. Yeah. So they're making a psychedelic honey, just
*  naturally. Yes. Natural. Wow. So you, uh, can put it in your tea and meet Jesus. That seems dangerous.
*  So maybe, maybe it's like a mild micro dosing type. That's true. I don't know. So yeah, so like that,
*  that's what they just grab it and eat it. Um, honeycombs to elder Hunter. Yeah. So these kids,
*  I think there's a video, uh, on my YouTube, Jamie, she can find it of these kids climbing
*  these trees. I think it's just Justin Ren fight for the forgotten is the YouTube channel.
*  And there's this kid that I put a GoPro on his head, uh, because he was just climbing trees,
*  like crazy up to the canopy of the rainforest. He's like nine years old. Oh my God. He climbs
*  200 feet in the air and he looks down at us. It's a 12 minute video or something, but we could
*  fast forward to any kind of safety harness. No, he's literally just doing a shimmying up it. He
*  doesn't even have a vine. He's doing it with his arms and his thighs. He's not. And he's just,
*  my daughter scaling it, just scaling it. And he looks down on us. I can barely see him in the tree
*  still because he's like over 200 feet tall. And, uh, and what's he getting up there? Well, they
*  practice for, um, two different things. He had his bow and arrow up there so he could shoot a nest,
*  um, and shoot birds out of nest in the trees from 200 feet up, 200 feet up, but he's shooting to
*  other trees. Oh my God. Um, and then they, that's how they collect honey. Look at him. This is a
*  little guy. This is him going from a little tree to getting over to a huge tree next to it, but
*  that's in Bobofi and I lived there for three months, I think in this village. And he's seriously
*  just scaling the tree. Yeah. It's a 12 minute video. What it's wild. If we can't have sound,
*  it's just him breathing. This guy is, oh, you can see us. That's not even sweating.
*  And he just keeps going until he gets, and then when he gets to the big part of the tree,
*  I should go back ups up back a little bit more because he starts just zooming down
*  he gets to the top and looks down at us. And whenever you see us, I think this is where it is, maybe
*  um, whenever he looks down, look at that, how high, oh boy. And that's not even when he was at the
*  very top and he's just using his hands and feet. Yeah. He literally has no rope, no vine. Don't you
*  feel like you should be under him to catch him? Yeah. But I would sometimes know from 200 feet up,
*  it would just break your arms. Yeah. That's like, yeah, it's wish me there's a, there's one other
*  video. Oh yeah. This right here. Look at this, uh, sharp shooters of these little mice. They put mice
*  in the middle of the, the village and they shoot them with bows and arrows. Yep. Um, that seems
*  mean. It's kind of mean, but he got, did they eat them? Yeah. Yeah. They eat them. So that's their
*  target practice. So they should grab like four or five. That's a rat, by the way. And a mouse. Yeah.
*  They shoot these rats and then they eat them. Yep. And actually not this one. Have you eaten
*  rat? But, uh, I have forest rat. What's it like? Not good. It's kind of stringy. I've had, I've had
*  Python. Uh, I've had, uh, Cobra. You ate Cobra? I've had monkey. I think there's a video of me
*  eating monkey on there. That's dark. Is there, is there a video of the kid with the, uh, the machete?
*  What's it like eating monkey? Does that freak you out? You're eating one of your ancestors?
*  This was right before the Ebola break. I didn't know about it. And then all of a sudden Ebola
*  and they're like, it's from eating monkeys. Oh Jesus. Why didn't y'all tell me you can Ebola?
*  We always eat monkeys. None of us have ever had Ebola. What kind of, what method of cooking is
*  it like a smoke monkey? You just smoke it. Yeah. Wrap it in a banana leaf. Yeah. It's a very
*  like stringy, hard muscular animal. Yeah. And my friend Steve Rinella had some, I think in Guyana,
*  he, uh, he ate a monkey. See this, uh, look at this kid here. He's with a machete. The machete's
*  as long as that kid is tall. What is he doing? Chopping down the street? Yeah. Just chopping
*  down the tree for firewood. But that kid looks like he's five years old. If that is younger than
*  that, I think how old, uh, well, he might be five, maybe four, four or five. And they're letting
*  them use a machete to chop down a fucking tree. Dude, they climb the trees with that. The kid,
*  you saw climb that tree. He was doing that with bows and arrows. Oh my God. With bows and arrows.
*  He climbed that tree. They're so hard. Yeah. Like that kid that's just hanging out by him to us.
*  The kid is right next to him. How many of these guys that live in these villages are injured?
*  Uh, I mean, they get injured from time to time, but they're super smart with the blades. I mean,
*  they grow up with them. I don't even mean it's like getting cut. I mean, just injured, injured.
*  There's no medical. Man, they roll their ankles through the forest. They, when they're climbing
*  knee ligaments. Yeah. What do they wind up doing? They just heal, heal up like by giving it rest.
*  What's kind of cool about the forest life or the village life is they literally,
*  they're up early, right? When the sun's coming up there, they're up there down when the sun
*  goes down. And so they, they, they're in tune with nature. Yeah. Absolutely. Circadian rhythms was
*  looking for, and then midday during the heat of the day, right? Three to 5 PM. They're normally
*  just chilling napping or in their hut, um, to where they're out of the sun. And so they're up
*  working before that they rest. And if they need to go back out before, um, the sun's down, they go
*  back out a second time hunting, gathering, come back in, prepare it. What's their primary, like
*  what are they trying to hunt? So forest antelope, forest hog or wild hog out there. Um,
*  um, lots of different kinds of birds, um, parrots, different things like that. Uh,
*  and they're using bows and arrows, homemade bows and arrows, right? Homemade. Yeah, definitely.
*  And the dangerous ones, I'm going to have to bring you a bow and arrow. I haven't done that.
*  Uh, I have one that is, uh, that I really love. I'll see if I can get to get, get you one. Um,
*  but, uh, they will give you two arrows. One has a metal blade and one's just a sharpened tip.
*  And they ask you which one would you use on an antelope and you choose which one you'd choose.
*  And then you ask which one would you use on a bird and then you choose which one would you think
*  between a blade and the sharpened wood, which one would you use on the antelope? You'd use a blade.
*  Okay. And then on a bird, which one would you sharpen stick? Yeah, that's what makes sense to
*  our mind, right? Yeah. It's actually the opposite. How come they use the metal on the bird because
*  that's going to kill the bird, right? They use the wooden tip because they, they dip that in poison.
*  Oh, Jesus. And so that's what they take the bigger animals out with is,
*  I see. So they just have to hit it. Oh yeah. They just have to anywhere in its body and it gets in
*  there. Now, does that poison infect them? No, it cooks out. Um, it's out of this. Uh, there's these
*  two things. It's these berries, um, and these not roots, but it's a, like a root fruit, not, um,
*  like a potato. Uh, it's this poisonous black potato that like they mash up. And if you,
*  if you mess with that stuff, the potato gets smashed or something in that oil or that, um,
*  whatever. Cause Saba not cause Saba cause Saba is the same thing, but it also is, is gets strict.
*  Nine. Oh yeah. I know that they are. They, they bet you have to boil it forever. They have to do
*  all this shit to cassava. And then the, I know that you use inside. Yes. Um, and this is a,
*  it's a black potato. I know they use the strict nine from cassava to poison things as well.
*  Oh wow. And they have like a bucket in, um, Ronella show, uh, Steve Ronella show, the meat
*  eater, which is, uh, on, um, it is on Netflix and no, the mediator is his website. Meat eater is
*  the Netflix show, but he, uh, went to, uh, Guyana and, uh, he's done a couple of trips to different,
*  I think Bolivia as well. And when you go to the jungle, like this, they have this incredibly,
*  uh, intricate process for cooking and making this cassava edible and these buckets that they have of
*  this like sort of process stuff as they're doing it is fucking hugely toxic. Yeah. And it's just
*  laying around and like kids are playing near it. And the kids have to be so careful. Yeah. The
*  parents have to be so careful with the poison. Yeah. Um, because once they dip those tips of
*  those arrows, they don't come back with them. They, they dispose of them really out in the
*  forest. It's just too dangerous, too dangerous to have around the kids, the toddlers that are
*  working around. Oh yeah. Cause toddlers are walking around with bows and arrows already. Um,
*  there, they have a bow and arrow before they're able to walk. So, um, they're just the sharpened
*  wooden tips without the poison dipped in them. Um, and so it's, it's awesome. And their way of life
*  is so incredible. And so that's what we're trying to help the Pygmies of Uganda right now.
*  So our trip, even Brady, who, you know, um, Brady was messed up. So all of us were, um,
*  they're just sick over there. What do you mean I messed up? Um, culture shock. Oh, and not just
*  culture shock, but what is it whenever you, it's not just PTSD, like, like just jolted with, with,
*  devastation of like in shock, in shock. Yeah. Um, in fact, we, we could play that one video and I'll,
*  it's a documentary trailer that cash app helped fund. I mean, and friends of Joe Rogan and, uh,
*  this trailer video is just from our, our last trip to Uganda. It's got sound, but I'll speak over it.
*  But it kind of sums it all up. Um, this little boy named Paulo, you'll see in his eyes, what I mean,
*  when you see this boy's eyes, um, you'll know just some of the devastation that he's gone through and
*  seen. You can see like eyes are the windows to our soul. Um, you can see the heart heartbreak in this
*  kid. Um, but I think it's called, uh, the botwa trailer video or something like that, Jamie, but
*  it's, um, uh, it's got an opening where it's just like, thanks to cash app, but then it shows,
*  how long is their studio? It's about a minute and a half.
*  Okay. Well, we'll play this then we got to wrap this thing up. Okay. I got one more thing to give you.
*  So that is in the Similiki national forest. That's King's Ito and the red,
*  but they were driven from their ancestral home and they're struggling to survive.
*  And this is on that one acre of land that they live on. That's some mushrooms.
*  Um, but they live in eight structures on this one acre of land and forced to live in this unknown village and literally don't have any food or clean water. That's where they live in those shelters. That's what they've been given when they were kicked out of the forest.
*  But there's no way that's the sewage running through their village and just being abused. Yeah, beyond imagination.
*  Um, because they think they're a cure for HIV. That woman was raped because these men thought they would be cured. That's a little Paulo there you can see in his eyes.
*  Men thought they'd be cured by having sex with her.
*  Yep. Or by collecting their blood. And so, uh, Paulo was held down and that's the new land, five acres of land that we were able to get them. So this is a celebration, just kind of transitioning into dancing with the drums and the leaves.
*  But now they have hope that they're going to survive. And here's at the school where they're getting new water and they're in class for the first time. They were told that they couldn't go to school, that they wouldn't be, that they couldn't learn.
*  And now actually the top five students at the school over the last six years are all batois, pygmy children. That's the new well that they're drinking from, one of them. So this is celebration. They're learning some MMA.
*  Uh, and we're there to help come alongside them and say, Hey, how can we, with our vision to defeat hate with love, our mission to knock out bullying worldwide, how can we do this in a practical, sustainable way?
*  And so yeah, Joe, like that little boy, Paulo that you saw, um, has scars on them from people holding them down and slicing them open, collecting his blood because they think he's the cure for HIV or the women there being sexually assaulted.
*  Some terrible stuff, but what we want to do to kind of sum up this documentary when we get there is, um, is have new land for them, them back in school, them farming for themselves, them selling it at the markets.
*  Um, and then, yeah. And then also stateside here. So kind of the two things to wrap up the two or three ways that people could support. If you're a martial arts academy, jujitsu school, you do MMA, taekwondo, wrestling, boxing, any of that.
*  You can join our end of the year fundraising competition in the top 10 are going to win incredible prizes, uh, gym renovations for every, there's also a raffle prize where every $500 you raise, you get the opportunity to have your gym transformed.
*  And this is all on our fight for the forgotten.com. So for the fight for the forgotten.org, take you there too. Okay. So we're going to go to heroes.
*  Okay.
*  If, if you're an individual and you want to support that way, we just started our fight club. And, uh, so our fight for the forgotten fight club. First rule is you do speak about fight club. Um, lince, if you don't, but, uh, yeah, it's our monthly giving club.
*  People can give a $5. So the price of a latte and that would make us a sustainable nonprofit where we know what our budget is every single month. How many wells we can drill, how much land we can get, how many people here stateside.
*  And this is again, all on fight for the gruff fight for the forgotten.org.
*  The fight club is on fight for the forgotten.org. That's our monthly giving club. Um, and then if you want to support Raiden, um, there's that go fund me and you just look up the hashtag stand with Raiden and you can give to him personally.
*  Spell Raiden.
*  R A Y D E N.
*  So it's stand with Raiden. Um, and you can go check out my Instagram, the big pig me or Twitter, the big pig me. And that will point you, um, into the direction of stand with Raiden. And then as we come to a close of sober October, I got one thing for you.
*  Oh, it's just one thing.
*  It's a little big though.
*  Whoa.
*  We're gonna have to go over your, uh,
*  What is that?
*  This is from another friend.
*  Jesus Christ. You got a lot of friends, bro.

*  So I know so rocked over is coming through.
*  Serious glasses, man.
*  What does that made out of?
*  I don't know. You tell me.
*  Liberal tears.
*  Oh, it's made of the bottom right next to it.
*  It's made of the bottom of a Johnny Walker.
*  Johnny Walker blue.
*  It's made of the bottom of a Johnny Walker.
*  Johnny Walker blue.
*  Wow.
*  So that's the blue, which is like 18 or 20 years.
*  That's a smart way of recycling the bottom of these containers too.
*  That's actually here.
*  Check this out real quick.
*  Okay.
*  Oh yeah. You can have some of that.
*  No, I can't.
*  Not sober October.
*  I can't.
*  Oh, it's fight for the forgotten coasters.
*  Yeah.
*  Very cool.
*  And so this right here, just be cycled bottles.
*  Okay.
*  This guy literally recycles these.
*  He's a fundraiser full time for nonprofits.
*  So he makes his glasses out of the bottles.
*  That's very cool.
*  Out of Tito's all that he gives 75% back to fight for the forgotten.
